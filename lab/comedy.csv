1.0,moonrise_kingdom,"My favorite Wes Anderson film, and one of the most poignant, meaningful movies I've ever seen."
1.0,moonrise_kingdom,"A strange, pre-teen love story that is almost too surreal to exist but manages to hit every scene perfectly by having a cast filled with old school big name hollywood actors and the best child actors since Stand By Me."

1.0,player,I like Julia Roberts
1.0,player,One of the most if not the most brilliant satire's about Hollywood.
1.0,player,The Player deserves comparison to Sunset Boulevard in how wicked and rebellious its commentary on Hollywood is - how failing in the film industry is a graver crime than murder.
1.0,player,Love everything. It gets better every time I watch. There's such restraint. Altman winks throughout but it never goes into camp mode. Tim Robbins is so beautiful.
1.0,player,The opening shot rivals the one in Orson Welles' TOUCH OF EVIL. It's a high wire act and there is not one stumble. It's undoubtedly one of my favorite Robert Altman films and that's saying a lot.
1.0,player,"If there's one film which taught me so much about movies in the first place, it's definitely going to have to be ""The Player""."
1.0,player,"The Player is hilarious, dark, and insightful, not to mention it is dripping with irony. It makes you think about what goes into making a great movie and the lengths that people will go to."
1.0,player,This is by far the best movie of all time. The first 8 minutes of Altman's crane shot in a Hollywood parking that never ceases to end gives me a boner. I love Altman. Long live Altman.

1.0,player,"En av mina absoluta favoriter, Ã¤ntligen del av min DVD samling. Lyle Lovett helt lysande, Tim Robbins likasÃ¥. Ã?ppningsscenen Ã¤r en lÃ¥ng tagning med Ã¥tskilliga Ã¥kturer, lite som Massive Attacks ""Unfinished Sympathy"" video (fast inte sÃ¥ bra fÃ¶rstÃ¥s...)."

1.0,player,"The movie that gave me the taste for the Hollywood system and put director Robert Altman back on the map, Tim Robbins is super-cool as a slick Hollywood exec driven to violent extremes when faced with a threatening writer whose calls were never returned.

1.0,player,Robert Altman's best film
1.0,player,"One of Altman's very best films, this riff on Hollywood is a mix of everything a film can be: funny, dramatic, scary, romantic, suspenseful, a mystery, etc. It's mixed into a two hour masterpiece where Altman takes his shots at Hollywood. Robbins is great as the studio exec."

1.0,antz,One of my favorite animations!
1.0,antz,"Extraordinary film! With its all star cast, and amazing animation and story, this film shines!"
0.0,antz,So we saw this movie at a free movies in the park event. me and half of the other people left due to the movie swearing. Whatever you do don't show this to your kids or they'll be saying the D word.
0.0,antz,It's so cliche with the poor guy getting the princess / saving the earth sorta thing.
1.0,antz,"My favourite Pixar. Great story, intelligent, funny script, and well-chosen cast. Superb animation and memorable music score. A winner in every department."

1.0,antz,I love this film. One of my childhood favorites!
1.0,antz,Watched it again after 8 years.... Will watch it again right now! Truly captivating!
1.0,antz,'Existentialism is an ANTism.' This has to be one of the best underrated 'kids' film ever. Holds WAY up.
0.0,antz,"When you would compare it to A bug's life, you would be dissapointed how much DreamWorks has copied from it. While a bug's life is childish and funny, Antz uses excessive idiocy to make people laugh. Truth to be told it does not deserve 95%. Good actors have wasted their talents on this film."
1.0,antz,"surprise, it's a cute movie"
1.0,antz,I love the story that the creators try to tell
0.0,antz,"Antz is a movie that takes it itself WAY too literally; and after a while, not only does it become boring, but annoying."
0.0,antz,"Just because there is a prolific director voiced a character, doesn't mean you should look past the actual plot and seriousness of the movie. Blatant rip off of A Bug's Life."
1.0,antz,Simply a great and funny film. I think adults would like it even more than children!
1.0,antz,What a BIG underdog.
0.0,antz,My mom: THIS IS A DISNEY FILM!?

1.0,antz,Great social commentary. competing with pixar even during the beginning
0.0,antz,Slept through most of it.... and gladly!
1.0,antz,A very well executed animated film that has been forgotten.
1.0,antz,"Maybe not by much appealing in color and visual but in the flow of the story and the outstanding star power voices of the the cast, for sure the 'Antz' will certainly captivate you and your eyes to keep on watching..."
1.0,antz,Imagine A Bug's Life but with a better cast and a darker storyline. Brilliant stuff.
1.0,antz,A perfectly funny and entertaining antventure (haha).
1.0,antz,Nice family animation.

0.0,antz,Complete Bugs Life ripoff.
1.0,antz,Great children's movie. It was cute.
1.0,antz,A Woody Allen comedy mixed with Orwellian undertones makes an animated feature that is vastly superior to its Pixar counterpart.

1.0,antz,"I always liked this movie better than A Bug Life,because to me this movie is smarter and funnier"
0.0,antz,I did't like this one much at all. A knock off of Bug's Life which I didn't like much either.
1.0,antz,Woody Allen as an animated ant. What could be better?

1.0,antz,One of those classic CGI cartoons that bring back the happy days of when I was a six year old
0.0,antz,"Should not be on top movies ever. Boring characters, decent plot, nasty animation."
1.0,antz,"In my opinion this is Dreamworks best film. Funny, mature and wonderfully animated, too bad Dreamworks would rather make films stuffed with pop culture references then this."
1.0,antz,love this film so much
0.0,antz,Hated it....probably because it came out the same year as A Bugs Life.
1.0,antz,"The movie's higher intelligence and advanced use of it's premise showcase DreamWork's penchant for non-catering, which makes it's thematics feel more admirable, if a little alienating, considering its time and mixed appeal."
1.0,antz,Woody Allen and Jennifer Lopez made this movie funny and clever. A great family movie for sure.
0.0,antz,This movie is terrible in every way and a horrible excuse for an animated film. The film reeks of Bug's Life knock-off and was poorly executed across the board.
1.0,antz,one of my all time favorites :) great famiy movie

0.0,antz,"not a Woody Allen fan, perv"
0.0,antz,I remember seeing but I don't remember what happens
1.0,antz,This one was made when we still thought it was possible to make animated films as good as Pixar. Nothing sense has gone to back up that theory.

1.0,antz,"Satiric and structured, it's another Woody Allen project that is a winner in my book."
0.0,antz,This movie is bad in comparison to the other bug movies. Woody Allen should stay in human form. Watch A Bugs Life instead.
0.0,antz,Pathetic rip-off of a bug's life.
0.0,antz,For a kids movie i didnt agree with some of the content and therefore would not let my child see until closer to his adolencent

0.0,antz,Watched this years ago and didn't like it at all.
1.0,antz,a joy to watch this is a comedy that is much better then expected. this is an animation that is more for the adults with its complexity and humour. great voice cast and very intelligent writing gives us a comedy you can watch over and over again.
0.0,antz,"Woody is fine, but his humor doesn't translate to adults. If he wants to relate to kids, then he'll have to marry another one. (oh crap that is harsh)"

1.0,juno,one of my favorite movies about about abortion

1.0,juno,i forgot that i was watching a movie and felt like i was looking into the portrait of a pretty awkward nine months. This is a very very good movie.
0.0,juno,"Wes Anderson has the market covered for dry comedies. Juno hasn't stood the test of time like any of Anderson's films have. At first I thought this movie was cute, but now it's just annoying and overrated. This movie tries really hard to be what Moonrise Kingdom is... Really hard."
1.0,juno,"Hands down one of my favorite movies of all time. Ellen Page's performance is phenomenal as the wise-cracking and lovable Juno, and the supporting cast ties it all together for a satisfying ending that leaves you satisfied."

1.0,juno,great for whole family
1.0,juno,"I beautiful, completely pure, heart-tugging... I'm just using adjectives aren't I? Adjectives aren't worthy of describing a movie like this. However, I'd have to see it again, by myself, without the audio commentary by my family."
1.0,juno,"Brilliantly written and very funny. Don't watch it if you have no knowledge of sexual content. My sister is 9 and when she went to the theater to see it with me and my friends, she didn't understand ANY of it."
1.0,juno,A clever comedy that raises large themes of parenthood and maturity that moves at the right pace and generates memorable dialogue.
1.0,juno,can you feel the feel tonight

1.0,juno,"Smart, funny, and touching, Juno is a sincere and honest comedy about teen pregnancy."
1.0,juno,"Ellen Page welcome to stardom! She effortlessly plays Juno and opposite her is Michael Cera who is perfect in his role here too. A smart movie that has people talking of it is pro life, or pro choice, but it is what it is and to me that is both, do what you want to do."
1.0,juno,"seriously, ..... 94% tomatometer , audience 89% though, i know this is the best movie i saw in 2013, still feel surprised, wow Love Ellen. 7.7(IMDB), 8.0(mtime), ok , now, ready for next Ellen's film ----""Hard Candy"" (aka, lollipop) ."
1.0,juno,"100% Juno is a rare, indie comedy that has a smart script, assured direction and an extremely talented cast! And the thing that best worked was the cute and comfortable chemistry between Ellen Page and Michael Cera, they were a perfect choice for the young couple, Juno and Paulie!"

1.0,juno,I just love Ellen Page's sarcasm and personality...made the movie one of my favorites!!!
0.0,juno,"Did not enjoy this over-hyped film. Every character uses the same ""hip"" dialogue, creating monotony and a lack of ""voice"" from any of the characters. It lacks joy as it wallows in its aimless ambiguity."
1.0,juno,"I'm not usually into ""teenage"" movies, but Juno was touching - and sweet. I loved it."
0.0,juno,It's like a documentary in animal planet.hehe...

0.0,juno,Am I the only one who hated this flick?
1.0,juno,"Cute, touching and funny."
1.0,juno,A typical story about a teenaged girl getting pregnant turns into a not-so-typical tale that takes many twists and turns when she is emotionally violated by some of the adults in her life. A must-see!!!
1.0,juno,"Definitely one of the best movies of the year. Juno has the perfect blend of hilarious comedy and real-life issues. The characters are brilliantly written and played, and the story crafted is a phenomenally real story that gets surprisingly sentimental."
1.0,juno,Language and alliteration make this movie great
1.0,juno,"Juno is one of the rare movies where nothing seems faked or forced. It is all organic and the result is just pure joy. This small film is a great big triumph of filmmaking, acting and writing that is sharp, honest and truly funny as hell. Hollywood, take notice. An instant classic."

1.0,truman_show,a really funny yet thought provoking move that i want all of my friends amd family to watch. Where is this Jim Carey now? Why did he disappear off of planet earth?

0.0,truman_show,"Can't help but to think that this is mocking Christians, to not be controlled by a 'God' and to encourage people to break free."
1.0,truman_show,I love this movie (particularly fitting after Plato) because it is moving and erudite. The Truman Show is easily in my top tens and I could discuss it for days!
1.0,truman_show,This movie gives you a sense of claustrophobia that a lot of movies don't really give. You feel for Truman as he realises that his whole life has been a lie. Jim Carrey gives his best performance and is practically Oscar worthy in scenes.
1.0,truman_show,Incredibly entertaining. Carry makes the movie so enjoyable and humorous.

1.0,truman_show,Some of Jim Carrey's finest work. Right up there with Dumb and Dumber and both Ace Ventura's.
1.0,truman_show,Jim Carrey's best and maybe Ed Harris' too.
1.0,truman_show,"""The Truman Show"" shows all the simpleness and baseness of life. The movie does this even more effectively. It critizes too many topics from how ordianary people live to how hungry are the people in front of a TV. This movie is not just essential for movies, it's essenital for society."
1.0,truman_show,"Awesome movie that represents the post modern society we are living in. A smart, ironic movie that everyone should see."

1.0,truman_show,"While the film itself is amazing, the ending feels like a disappointment to the audience, but that's where it could shine, it all matters on perspectives and opinions."
1.0,truman_show,"A visionary movie, that uses television and religion as methaphores to represent how a lot of people watch life through blinders, a masterpiece from Weir and Niccol."
1.0,truman_show,"The Truman Show relies on Jim Carry's down to earth un-comedic performance, Andrew Niccol's thought-provoking and intelligent script and Peter Weir's steady direction. While also giving thought provoking themes about humanity and reality T.V. shows that get your brain thinking."
1.0,truman_show,"A lot of people rag on Carey for his serious films, but this one is fantastic. It's eye opening, makes you think and is inventive. This movie makes you question the world around you, and what it means to be human and everything that entails. Brilliant."
0.0,truman_show,"Unique, but boring as all hell."

1.0,truman_show,"This is one of the most original movies I have ever seen. Touching, sad and inspirational. A man born in a tv show who has no idea and his adventure to find out. The film is incredibly clever and explores ideas that no one else before did. Everyone should see this."
1.0,truman_show,Very nice. Thought-provoking and just plain fun to watch.

1.0,truman_show,"Great film. Excellent Jim Carrey and Ed Harris. The ""talking to God"" scene was amazing!"
1.0,truman_show,"*GREAT MOVIE* There is an INSANE amount of detail put into this movie. After about 10 viewings, I'm still noticing new, small things that add a little to the genius plot the movie has. It's funny and dramatic, all at once, and it fits perfectly."
1.0,truman_show,Could watch this 100 times and still discover something new. Also an eerily accurate prediction of the future.

1.0,truman_show,Jim Carrey wins at life. Ed Harris rules. And this movie as a whole is insanely good
1.0,truman_show,"One of the coolest ideas for a movie. You know the plot from the start, but you keep wondering to what extent Truman's life is controlled, and you learn more and more as it progresses, just like Truman himself."
1.0,truman_show,"Carey is magnificent proving seamlessly that comedy and drama can coincide perfectly. The plot, otherwise outlandish, becomes realistic by forcing its audience to question what is happening while their backs are turned."

1.0,truman_show,"The themes of breaking past societal & religious falsity, existentialism, celebrity worship, and the nature of escapism through television are brilliantly presented here, but The Truman Show also works on the simple level of entertainment that it comments on. A masterful film in every respect."

1.0,truman_show,"The fact that The Truman Show is so aware of what audiences today want to see, it is able to flip reality television on its head, resulting in an incredibly smart and funny comedy."
1.0,truman_show,"One of the best movies I've ever seen - really on the spot, funny, and subtle. Some of the funniest parts are at the beginning - where there's small cracks in the logic of the Seahaven world. It's also pretty disturbing - I hope nothing like that ever happens. Overall, a great film."

1.0,discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie,The satire here is so very sharp. Bunuel has fangs and he's not afraid to bare them. In addition he plays with the form so masterfully; there are dreams within dreams. One is never quite sure where one is. No one gets off without a skewering.

1.0,discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie,"Possibly the best movie I have ever seen. Each scene is a treasure. Superlative acting and thinking.

1.0,the_big_sick,Loved this movie! I was refered to it for a sociology class I am taking and I am really glad I chose this movie! So many ups and downs. The comedy is cheesy but makes it for a real rom-com type. Must watch if you are into rom-com.

1.0,the_big_sick,Rarely does a movie make me both laugh so hard and cry from joy and heart break. I watched this movie on a plane ride and the movie transported me to pure enjoyment.

1.0,1068832-sense_and_sensibility,"It's a really sweet, not on par to pride and prejudice, but it's a nice love story. Slightly cheesy in places tho. And Alan Rickman need I say more!!! Both sisters are played wonderfully"

1.0,1068832-sense_and_sensibility,I think this movie is by far the best adaptation. Ang Lee did a great job bringing those characters to life. The only thing I am unsure of is Hugh Grant.

1.0,1068832-sense_and_sensibility,A highly accurate and detailed movie of the famous Jane Austen's novel of the same name. Hats off to Ang Lee's wonderful direction and Emma Thompson's brilliant adaptation.

1.0,1068832-sense_and_sensibility,"This movie is THE best movie when you've just had a horrible break up. I love how Emma Thompson made a story with such an amazing amount of misfortune, terribly funny. And I love how Ang Lee made scene after scene a work of art."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"This is a masterpiece - elaborately demonstrating how to block a scene and edit in accordance with style, and effortlessly explaining the rules and manufacturing of the cinematic medium."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,The plot balance is amazing. All-around very well made movie with deep meaning.
0.0,the_rules_of_the_game,I just wasn't really able to follow this. Maybe because I'm sleep deprived. But I also found it hard to care about these characters. Is the point that they're all hypocrites or tritely immoral? Okay.... plenty of people are. Why should I care?
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Talvez a mais precisa e mordaz crítica à superficialidade burguesa. Uma obra extremamente política travestida de comédia de costumes.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Incredible film. Everything was superb!
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"The brilliance of the film apparently eluded audiences at its release, but seen nowadays, it ranks among the supreme masterpieces of moviemaking."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Very Shakespearian in its tragic elements. We see this tale unravel in complete and utter chaos. It's breathtaking.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,It's overwhelming tragedy makes you crush your heart yet it grows into you oh so fondly.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Overrated. But brilliant. I just think Jean Renoir put out some better material that doesn't get the credit this one does.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A moral narrative on amorality. Enjoyed longer takes in contrast to annoying editting.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Après ce film de Renoir, le cinéma est entré dans une nouvelle ère qui - bien qu'ayant depuis connu maintes innovations et maintes évolutions - perdure encore à travers la vision géniale de Renoir."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Probably the best cinematic example of using lies to tell the truth. Simply marvelous entertainment.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"One of the greatest movies ever made, yo. It's like YEEEAAAAHHH MY MAN, JEAN, MAN. HE'S MY BOY. MAH BOY."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A message of substantial proportions, a class of souring sensibilities, La RÃ¨gle du Jeu is powerful, potent and smart."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Jean Renoir is the director who best explains on screen that most people are neither good or bad; but sometimes do good things and sometimes do bad things. He finds humanity in every character.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Absolutely stunning to behold. Renoir's definitive work. Manages to celebrate, condemn, and mourn pre-war french decadence."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"One of the greatest movies ever made, yo. It's like YEEEAAAAHHH MY MAN, JEAN, MAN. HE'S MY BOY. MAH BOY."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Jean renoir's masterpiece The rules of the game is the most authentic and original film of the classic cinema. his vision of the low class with the high class is superb, even when the two classes collide is fantastic, the connection between the poor and the rich and their desires and misadventures."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Not only works as a clever satire of upper class society, but as a precursor to modern affair based films. This may very well be one of the greatest of the silent films I have seen as of yet (though city lights is still my favourite). Excellent!"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"At this point, we've run out of ways to say that this is a great movie."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Terrific. Of course.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Renoir's tragicomedy set in pre-WWII France is an absolute delight. The director's use of deep focus combined with long takes allows the film to progress in a remarkably lifelike manner.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A rule-breaking, jaw-dropping fabulous comedy; a whirling, seething, absolutely scathing look at the French upper class, running pell-mell like lemmings into the sea. One of the greatest, darkest comedies ever made."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"If you are a fan of Robert Altman ensamble pictures, you need to see this film"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,One of the few French films I like.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"yes, we all have our reasons."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,One of the masterpieces cinema has to offer. The way the camera moves in this is simply amazing. You'll rarely see a movie staged as well as this.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Devastating. Part comedy of manners, part slamming door farce, all wrapped up in a shell of class warfare and their similarities. I am in pure awe of this perfect film."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"It's no insult to call the film an uncompromising, fascinatingly sophisticated echo of Hemmingway's 'The Sun Also Rises'."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,An absolutely sublime film. My 2nd favorite film of all time - following only Les Enfants du Paradis.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Jean Renoir`s satire of human manners is easily one of the most profound and multifaceted films I`ve ever seen!
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Jean Renoir's masterpiece is easily one of the first great films of the 20th Century.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,One of the greatest films of all time.

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Soooooo good. Just brilliant.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"One of those movies you can watch over and over. The characters are shallow and complex, shrill and humorous, affected and vulnerable, all amounting to a tragicomic highwire act of dour resplendence."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"One of the most important films ever made, Revoir's classic stands through the weathering of time, without being rusted a bit."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Other films seem to make more sense after watching a classic, from any decade really. This most certainly is one and it's spellbinding!"

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A Summer's Tale: Again I am in love with a Rohmer's character. It's not hard to guess which one, if you've seen this film. The Rules of the Game: Ah... finally I watched this. Amazing how so much is said, but what is untold carries even more depth."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,One of my all time favourites. Full review coming up.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Every frame of La regle du jeu seems dominated by Renoir's personality; yet the most appealing facets of that personality are generosity, openness, responsiveness. As a result, La regle is at once the auteur film par excellence and a work of co-operation and active participation"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Renoir's painfully brilliant comedy of manners is one of the best films of all, a masterpiece of movement, and a balancing act of character. In the words of Desson Thomson, it is life at its messiest unfolding at its most beautiful."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Renoir truly creates a masterpiece here. A biting look at high society in France at the time, this 'controversial' film is gorgeous nigh its whole length. It's vilification of society is matched in efficacy only by it's humor, which is dark and transgressive."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Often regarded as a precursor to Citizen Kane as the first modern sound film
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A very great masterpiece, 'Rules of the Game"" is to film what ""Don Giovanni"" is to opera--a perfect work of art and the completion of its genre"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Renoir's finest, as I am sure many directors would confess for copying Renoir's style. Obviously better films have been made in the same genre, just remember is was Renoir was the first to make such a film, thus the origionality is his, an no one elses."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A great, sprawling film full of realistic characters, depth, and charm."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A brilliant social commentary that is totally deserving of it's reputation as one of the best film's ever made.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A stunning portrayl of a tottering society on the verge of calamity with countless imitated sequences.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Takes the cinema to places that not other director has gone.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A masterpiece. Also, Jean Renoir in a bear suit. What up."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"For many film lovers, there's Jean Renoir, and then everybody else. Well one look at this astonishing film, and it's hard to dispute such a notion. Rules of The Game may very well be the Citizen Kane of French cinema. Check it out."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Starts slowly, but develops beautifully into a rich space."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,One of the best and memorable French b&w; movies. Satirical look on bourgeoisie is packed with walloping punches from an amazing script and excellent Renoir direction. And that ending is sadly haunting.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"So quintessentially a French cultural experience, it's almost equivalent to the first time one sees Paris at night. Cinematic perfection."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Clasico del cine frances acerca de ""los de arriba y los de abajo"" que en su epoca fue un completo fracaso de taquilla. Ahora es un trabajo absorbente, complejo, lleno de dialogos inolvidables y con una fotografia exquisita. Un trabajo inmortal."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Quite simply one of the greatest movies ever made. An intricately crafted work that never loses touch with the intimate human elements of the characters it depicts. All the more amazing since it seems to be so... effortless.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,In the same league as Citizen Kane in that any descriptions do not suffice this film's grandeur.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Cada vez que ves esta Obra maestra sacas nuevos detalles que antes te perdiste :D
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Though it is my opinion this film is over rated-it's not one of the greatest films, it still deserves a top rating. It's basically about how passions can lead people astray and make them act foolishly. The ending is somewhat shocking and justifiably legendary."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,this one hit me like a ton of bricks.
0.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"I appreciate the satire and that it was good for its time, 70 years ago, but I found it quite boring to watch. Plus they seemed to be speaking too fast!"

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Towering masterpiece from a time when film directors still respected their audience and aspired to communicate something about the human condition. This film as as life-affirming as most contemporary cinema is the opposite
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"The perfect example of a farce, with the added inclusion of a tragic ending."

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,An engaging and exciting film full of elegant surprises! Renoir's finest!
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Perfect, the ultimate movie. Far too dense to absorb. Every role, every movement, every element of stage, every breath, evey word, eveything has a purpose. The equal of citizen Kane if not superior, really amazing."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Superb comedy of class, manners, behavior. Fine performances. People who like Gosford Park (and Robert Altman films in general) will get a lot out of this one."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,One of the BEST films ever made. period.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"I bought and watched this one cold, only knowing that it was ranked as the number 3 movie of all time in a census of film critics and directors. And this scathing attack of the fickle French bourgeoisie deserves to be there."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A masterful microcosm of Europe on the brink of cultural collapse
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Renoir is charming and funny. He believes in the good in humanity.I'm in love with Octave.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A great movie to revisit at any time - on the grandness and pettiness of love, friendship, and human emotions in general. Unforgettable characters. Jean Renoir is great for an actor, too, not only for a director! Can't believe it's from 1939 - beats anything I've seen from the new century..."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"It's better every time you see it, especially with all the extras in the Criterion Edition."

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Oh my yes. One of the best movies ever made. If you're reviewing this movie, then you are familiar with it and I dont have to explain that is a an amazing satire on the class system in 3rd Republic France blah blah blah"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,I remember this film. Saw it way back in College.. FAntastic. ..Now I want to see it again. Renoir--sheer genious

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,There is no reason not to see this.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"This wonderful film is lucky to still be intact after bannings by the French government and burnings of all available copies by the Nazis. That being said, the movie explores the tense relationships between lovers and friends in the pre-War French high society."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Es tan espectacular que hay que verlo para creerlo. Todo es innegablemente excelente, obra maestra de obras maestras. Sin palabras."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Fantastic movie. A must see if you have not done so yet. Picks apart the upper classes and caused a ton of controversy. A must see, I don't know how much more I can stress that."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Classic Renoir. Nuff' said.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"I know the film is about the French pre-war aristocracy, but I loved what it had to say about love, lust, and friendship, and how often they can be concealed or confused."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A great movie for those who love movies. One of the first films ever shot it depth, Rules of the Game is technically far ahead of its time. Beyond that, the characters are well developed, and the implication of montage shows the tension of pre-WWII France as the war draws nearer."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,One of the Cinema's most historically significant and most controversial works is an outstanding irreverent satire of bourgeois sensibilities from the master Renoir.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Considered one of the greatest films of all time. Jean Renoir
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Like ""Gosford Park""? See where it came from here. So much going on in this film, you could watch it ten times and see something new each viewing."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Renoir famously said 'Everybody has their reasons'. This, his most encompassing film, reconciles his obsession with deep staging and focus with his empathy and love for people caught up in their messy lives and problems. Humanist cinemas towering masterpiece."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,This really is the film you can watch over and over and over and keep seeing it as fresh as ever. At least that's how I feel after my fifth viewing. Renoir's films invite you into them - they build walls that set you free to roam within their interiors to discover layers of humanity.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Qu'est-ce tu veux mon vieux, aujourd'hui tout le monde ment...!"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Such a layered film, in plot, theme, and mis-en-scene that it gets better with every viewing."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A rule-breaking, jaw-dropping fabulous comedy; a whirling, seething, absolutely scathing look at the French upper class, running pell-mell like lemmings into the sea. One of the greatest, darkest comedies ever made."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A masterpiece of understatement and half-expressed emotion, with a lot of colorful and interesting characters put through their paces in a narrative that doesn't force anything."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Great dark comedy. Highly recommended.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,The only correct answer to the question; What is the best movie ever made.

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Una commedia ironica e disincantata perfetta in ogni suo aspetto.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Possibly the greatest film ever made. I've seen it a dozen times and never get tired of it. The recent digital restoration makes it even better.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Really liked it 16 years ago. Should probably re-view it sometime.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,This is why I decided to be a Director
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,it feels like your peeking through the bushes watching this.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Better than Citizen Kane and was made 2 years before. Wonderfully beautiful film, use of the moving camera and different plains of action was radical and groundbreaking. Great Movie."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Tout simplement un film brillant. Peut-être plus important encore que ne l'est Citizen Kane. Les longs travellings en chassé-croisé dans le couloir de l'hotel sont des moments forts de l'histoire du cinema.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Conveys the hypocrisy and conformity in social circles perfectly. Renoir's best film, perhaps."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,One of the finest motion pictures ever made. Absolutely a masterpiece. I cannot recommend it highly enough.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,En stor og strålende film om borgerskapets laster og dyder. I Frankrike får man sågar kjøpt filmmanuset som en vanlig pocketbok.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,One of the greatest films ever made.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Pretentious, Moi! But it is a devastating look at pre-war French society, which confirms many prejudices. And it is made by a Frenchman, which shatters many more."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A humorous movie that pokes fun at the upper-class. One of the finest in french cinema
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Essential Renoir. It's difficult to find a director with two films bot has good as this and The Grand Illusion. Simply Great.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,It's biting and hilarious - and there is a guy in a bear suit (who doesn't love that?).
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Frankly my all-time favorite movie, nothing matches Renoir's extraordrinary direction or his script and the last image is one of the greatest and most haunting images ever put on a screen"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Vicious and biting, yet somehow still oh so funny, The Rules of the Game is one of the best social critiques on film. Renoir goes right for the throat of the oblivious upper class, and he tears their jugular right out. A classic."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Jean Renoir's 1939 masterpiece is still the most humorous film of any decade. Think of it as a caustically hilarious documentary of the discreet charm of the bourgeoisie.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A biting critique on class -- Renoir's calling card
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Two words: Jean Renoir. No one expresses the inherent bittersweet beauty of the human condition better.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Terrific. Of course.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Jean Renoir (son of the Impressionist painter, Auguste) transforms film into art with this movie. Robert Altman borrowed heavily from ""La Regle..."" for his movie ""Gosford Park"" (also fantastic). An acute observation of the upstairs/downstairs world of high society 1930s France."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Renoir is the bestest.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,This is one of the many important Renoir masterpieces. Dude was a true rebel.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,what can you say about the greatest film right before the beginning of the greatest war?
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A movie by Jean Renoir
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"The original upstairs, downstairs examination. The sheer depth of material that Renoir is able to capture in his long takes is mighty impressive. As is the dramatic but still inherently complex emotionally honest lives of the film's many characters."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Why does PT Anderson love Renoir so much? Well look at how much he takes from him (excluding There Will be Blood). The fluidity of movement and space in this film is just off the charts. Engaging to watch.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"So widely (and wisely) praised now that it's tempting to resist iconoclastically, but this is really a wonderful movie. Notice the incredible use of countryside footage - fields and grasses and grounds. This film looks like no other. It's set and filmed like no other. It's so unspeakably gorgeous."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,This film gets every character right and has to be one of the first to make full use of cinema's possibilities for using space to tell a story.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Another one of those films that is considered among the 'best of all time' that actually lives up to hype. Visually this has to be one of the most sophisticated films ever, but it is never showy or obvious."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,really holds up well to repeated viewings. i think i prefer this one to grand illusion even
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Life is like that, sometimes."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Was surprised at how bad ass this movie is. Classic? Yep. Long takes? Yep. Commentary on the class system? YEP!
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,How can I only be seeing this for the first time? Jean Renoir's story of a disastrous country house weekend in pre-WWII France is a devastating look at the folly of over-reliance on social mores. Essential viewing.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,pretty much a perfect film.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"I was surprised at how modern the characters were in this. I know that seems strange, but considering the year it was released, I didn't expect male-female relationships to be so easy (I see the irony, considering the end)."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A delightfully comic but equally scathing commentary on the hollowness of the aristocratic pre-World War II French society.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Renoir et tous les acteurs sont bons!
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Quite possibly the best film ever made. Moves with such energy and wit. The pace and intense characterization are outstanding! With each viewing, there is always something new to be absorbed. For anyone interested in classic cinema, this is a beast to be reckoned with, in the best possible way."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A ferocious social commentary. If you were to give the script to a studio in these days, there's no way they would fund a production for it."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Brilliant, layered, subtle, I have seen this 3 times and each time I discover something new. The cinematography is breath taking this film is a must!"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"One of the best movies ever made? Yeah, yeah, that's about right."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A must see - french classic - life of the privileged.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Social engagement as sexual revolution. This movie turns your adopted Puritan ideas of 'the way sex should be' on it's ear. What's more, it was made in 1939. Beat that, Closer*.*movie starring Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"One of the most beautiful films of all time, it is so consistent, the acting is superb and Renior is a genius behind the camera and the angles and positioning"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A perfect movie in its way.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Meilleur film francais ever ?
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,One of the all time greats!
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"I've read that a true classic grows with each reading/viewing. That is exactly why this is my favorite movie. I generally don't go in for wishing I could meet people from the past, but Jean Renoir is the exception."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"The movie where Jean Renoir explore the sequence plan and the image great gray scale to tell us a modern 1939 fable about love, jealousy and death between a noble married couple: he is a French man and she is a German woman."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Absolutely perfect in every way. I've watched it dozens of times over the course of my life and find new things to admire in it every time. If this rating system allowed ten stars, that's what I'd award it. Or thirty. Or a hundred."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Almost 80 years old and still standing the test of time. Little known film (outside of critical studies circles) and should be seen by anyone who gets a chance.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Not only a satire on the upper-class, but a full-on indictment of the facades of human nature. ""Is it a comedy, or is it a tragedy? Either way, it's a masterpiece."""
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"The grandaddy of all those rich-Europeans-gather-at-someone's-estate -for-the-weekend movies. Very funny, very tender and very tragic, this has lots to say about life, love and human folly. Should be required viewing for anyone with a heart."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"this film really stands up to all the critical praise. a wild romp through the french aristocracy circa 1939. renoir's classic is hilarious, meticulously filmed, thoughtfully scripted, and ultimately heartbreaking. this is one of the greats."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"paul schrader considers this the film without which there can possibly be no 'film canon.' i whole-heartedly concur. a brilliant, moving, hilarious and painful film, featuring great performances, great photography, and wonderful dialogue."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A Comedy From France? No. The French can't do comedy--not from the same country where Sartre was born. This is a farce-- It hurts to laugh and that was Renoir's point.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A Black and White French film? Really? But it is amazing that this film written about the different classes in French Society still is resonant today. Octave is one of my favorite characters of all time.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Brilliant, lost for words."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,holy shit freaking amazing.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Yeah, it's one of the best films ever made. There's really not much else I can say."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,This is a real movie. Those movies you like are garbage. See this and learn something.

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"An absolute masterpiece, brilliant satire about class in pre-war France."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Incredible movie by Renoir with a clear indigtment of the decaying morals and social uselessness of the upper classes of pre-war France. A true movie masterpiece and a stinging satire.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A Jean Renoir classic, this film truly deserves its place at the top of many film lists."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Once you get to know Jean Renoir, his films are more rewarding with each viewing. To some it may be dry, but it has such strong complexity to how everything is composed. Characters, movement, timing, conversation, cinematography, DEEP FOCUS, all utilized to gratifying extent."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,An almost perfect mess of drawing-room farce and biting social comment from master director Renoir (son of Auguste). The hunt scene has to be seen to be believed.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"absolute brilliance! a truly bold statement on class rules, and the sheer uselessness of idle people. you may not get it's greatness right away, and thats the brilliance of it. it is so subtle, that it takes a while after viewing it for the true meaning of the film to sink in. a true masterpiece"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A phenomenal film that needs to be seen several times in order to fully appreciate (or even just understand) it's reputation as one of the ""greatest"" movies ever made."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,One of the best French films ever made.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"This is it, folks. This is the film That Which No Greater Can Exist."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Love, real love is when someone is there to help you get out of the bear suit. That thing that people do at their chateaux on hunting weekends--that's not love, just a game that simulates it."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A fascinating look at the alien world of the French upper class before World War II. Essential.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Some critics have called it the greatest film of all time. It's certainly in the running. Highly influential, justifiably so."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Jean Renoir's magnum opus.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Starts off a little slow, but once it gets going its definitely a treat. Renoir's look into class is as fascinating as the characters in the film, but the real achievement of the film is the technical skills displayed- simply outstanding. 9.5/10"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Classic, influential, funny, tragic, and just perfect."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Top 5 movies of all time. The plot is a simple comedy. But the filmmaking skills on display here may never be equalled.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Renoir is one of my favorite directors. If you want to know why just see this gem of a movie that ranks amongst the best movies ever made by anyone in any country.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Renoir's virtuosic dissertation on class relations has remained as fresh as ever, influencing an entire generation of filmmakers from Altman to Godard."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,This is on my top ten favorite movies
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Robert Altman (my favorite director) once famously said ""I learned the rules of the game from The Rules of the Game."" And Altman may be the only director who's shown that he has the breadth of vision that Renoir has in his masterpiece, one of the small handful of the greatest films ever made."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"If I had 5 films to take with me to a desert island, this would be number one. It's a film that you can't reasonably begin to appreciate the first time, and each time after 10, you dicover how awe is a boundless state."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"If an alien species descended upon Earth and asked me to explain to them what is cinema, I wouldn't say a word. I would simply sit them in front of a TV set and show them two films: Citizen Kane and The Rules of the Game."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"It may not have the distinctive look of 'Citizen Kane' or the thrills of Hitchcock, but this is as perfect as films get: fluid, alternately comic and tragic, always graceful in presentation... with just a little bit of sex"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Brilliant. One of the best of all time.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A humanist masterpiece!
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"If you want to learn how to move a camera, all you need to do is watch any Renoir film, especially this, his masterpiece."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Amazing film. Way before its time. The music and cinematography are wonderful.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,If only the French could make more like this.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Pre WWII France. On the same plane as 'Kane.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A wonderful early masterpiece.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,this one is up there.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"One of the four or five best movies ever made, a tantalizing ambiguous portrait of morality, honor, and propriety, with rich characters and incredible photography."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,JADORE ce film. the critique renoir makes is brilliant.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,In my top 5 for sure. By far the best French film of all time by my second favorite director Jean Renoir.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"greatest film ever, period. End of discussion."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"One of the greatest of all time. The camera is a character, exploring and discovering just as much as any of the actual characters. It is funny, sad, and everything in between. It is the elegy to a society that is destined for, and meant for, extinction."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"It's the ending that makes the entire movie worthwhile for me. Good stuff overall; don't let expectations of it being ONE OF THE GREATEST MOVIES EVERRRRRR get in the way of just enjoying it, either."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Early cinematic movie, therefore it's very dramatic but in a good way because it's not too exaggerated. The cast was perfect and there is a surprise ending, but the beauty of this ending is not in of itself--it is NOT the climax of the movie.......you'll just have to watch it"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Easily the greatest movie ever made
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Renoir is just amazing...
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,All-time best Renoir? Hard to choose just one...
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Wow, one of my favorite movies. Renoir really knew how to capitalize on multiple levels of action, and really knew how to play with emotions and test our acceptances of societal conventions. If you like older movies, you definitely have to see this one."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Renoir's brilliant satire of bourgeoisie. Focusing on the lives of many characters and intertwining them perfectly during a weekend hunting trip, this film is one of the greats."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Renoir. With the craftsmanship of his father, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Jean paints a satirically delicate and critical portrait of French aristocracy. Easily outshines The Grand Illusion in my opinion."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"What ""Gosford Park"" wishes it was. Brilliant."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,By far the greatest film EVER made.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Renoir's statement on the bourgeois is done so well. Contains one of my favorite scenes of all times.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Worth seeing just to see Jean Renoir in a bear suit.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Truly one of the classics of film. I am baffled when I heard about all of the people that disliked it upon initial release. This film is absolutely awesome. Renoir was definitely a master of his craft.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Renoir handles the politics of class, sex and (quite literally) the boundaries within and outside le chateau with such deft and artistry. Such a great work of dialogue and imagery-- a striking and potent commentary of a Europe at the edge of another World War."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Beautiful. That is all.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Jean Renoir may be the greatest of all time, and this is his greatest film."

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"one of the greatest movies of all time, ever. took a few viewings to see what was really there, but it is an incredible play of characters and stories, intertwining and paralleling, producing symphonic moral tale. renoir himself stands strong amidst a great cast."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,I've really grown to cherish this more and more over the years.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,This movie almost single-handedly got me into non-English films.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"I always heard the name Jean Renoir tossed around as if he was a good director with movies worth watching. Well, for what I've seen in this, he is a good director with movies worth watching unless you love rabbits. Renoir doesn't love rabbits."
0.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"I never thought i would fall asleep to a film, BUT that was before i registered myself in Film 1400 and before i saw this film. I WILL try and see it again, but teh first time around, did NOT do it for me!"

1.0,1010792-its_a_wonderful_life,"The only movie to ever make my father cry. Holds a very special place in my heart. Like the great Roger Ebert said: The best and worst things that ever happened to ""It's a Wonderful Life"" are that it fell out of copyright protection and into the shadowy no-man's-land of the public domain."
1.0,1010792-its_a_wonderful_life,A classic! I just saw the movie for the first time last night and was blown away. It's as relatable now as it was back when the movie was filmed.

1.0,1010792-its_a_wonderful_life,"Contrary to popular belief, I love this film because it's terribly depressing. Even with the love of family, Bedford Falls is the best you can hope for--for me, this is about settling, and while I might not agree with the message the story is told uncommonly well."

1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,It's a little hard to root for Marilyn to marry to the dorky rich guy but the rest of the film is so damn funny and pleasant to watch that it hardly matters. I sometimes forget what a great commedienne she was and this film proves it in spades.

1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,absolute classic ! Diamonds are a girls best friend!
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,"Lorelei Lee in that pink dress and those diamonds was my aesthetic model way back when. Her morality, however, is delightfully wayward and justified in a way which could only have held water in the 1950s. Terrific tunes too."
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,"Diamonds realy are a girls best friend! :) Wow, fab film!"
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,Bye Bye Baby = greatest song in the whole movie
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,Fantastic adaptation of Anita Loo's book. Both Marilyn Monroe & Jane Russell played fantastic roles & set in my beloved Paris!!!

1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,"Monroe and Russell, are a beautiful comic duo. I couldn't stop laughing, pure Marilyn Monroe."
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,"Hilarious and outrageous examination of gender politics circa 1953. Monroe and Russell are an awesome comic duo. And it's a musical to boot. Hawks really could do it all, couldn't he?"
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,"""is there anyone here for love?"""
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,"A wondefull, witty comedy with Marilyn Monroe at her best. Also has some loaded undertones about gender roles and goldigging. Is it empowering? Degrading? On thing is sure, it's great fun."
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,Diamonds are a Girls Best Friend! What more can I say? I know the words and all the songs backwards I've watched it so many times. Marilyn at her pouty best and Jane Russell fabulously bolshy as her mate and chaperone.

1.0,sideways,Easily in my top 5 of all-time favorite offbeat comedies. If I am drunk -- top 2.
1.0,sideways,"Sometimes the audience score embarrasses me; this is one of those times. Great performances, great script, rare depth. If you haven't seen it, and you have enough wit to bear with character exploration at least on a rudimentary level, see it."
1.0,sideways,"A great film. Humourous and emotional at the same time with an excellent performance from Thomas Haden Church, an actor who prior to this film, I thought was a washed up has been. I just didn't like being faced with a full frontal view of an overweight man's johnson towards the end."
1.0,sideways,"Sideway's mixture of comedy, drama, and romance is wholly unpredictable and profound."
1.0,sideways,A must watch for wine lovers and fans of Giamatti. The art of film-making doesn't get much better than this.
1.0,sideways,Very smart smart and quirky down to earth and original. This movie had me from start to finish and yet another great performance from Paul Giovanni.
0.0,sideways,"This film was both rubbish and stupid. Why are these people drinking wine all the time ? If I was rich enough, I would buy all the wine in the world and destroy it all so that nobody has to sit through a film like this again. P.S it isn't funny"
1.0,sideways,my favorite movie of all time. Great film to practice acting too.
1.0,sideways,"One of my all time favourites, just like the wine it features, it gets better with age a thought after consuming it."
1.0,sideways,A drama worth checking out with Paul Giamatti's performance as the core of the film
1.0,sideways,"Devout to its journey's cause thanks to superb lead performances and a wonderful screenplay by Payne and Jim Taylor, Sideways is just like an excellent pinot: rich in many wonderful flavours, capturing middle-life's joyful highs and painful lows."
1.0,sideways,Funniest film i've ever seen but not the best. The Wallet scene is still the funniest and this film just made me wet myself
1.0,sideways,This is one of my top five movies of all time. I love it.
0.0,sideways,one of the worst films ive ever seen
1.0,sideways,"Charming and funny. This film delivers with laughs, while also having many serious undertones."
1.0,sideways,Movies seldom manage to this entertaining and poetic at the same time. Payne's Sideways is full of magical surprises.
1.0,sideways,"This film truly surprised me. I went in expecting a good film due to its reviews, but what I got was a uniquely rewarding experience that was everything from all-out raunchiness to good, clean fun. Worth the watch, most definitely."
1.0,sideways,"Great movie, great casting."
1.0,sideways,"Classic Giamatti & Co. I saw this in my 20s and found it only to be so so, but after a decade of relationship experience, in my 30s I found this to be utterly hilarious."
1.0,sideways,Truly original with an incredible turn from Paul Giamatti. Full review later.
1.0,sideways,Sideways its one of my favorites movies of all times! I had seen the movie about a dozen times and in every time I see it I laugh out loud!
1.0,sideways,"Incredible, incredible movie! One of my top 20 films of all time!"
1.0,sideways,Breezy and mature road trip with deep reflection on human nature. I recommend enjoying it over a glass pinot noir.
1.0,sideways,"I'm getting to this one 10 years later, but this is another reason why Alexander Payne is one of the best directors working today. This one is hard to recommend unless you're a fan of his previous work though."
1.0,sideways,"A very unique kind of comedy that this generation simply could never provide once more. If I'll be saying anything, it's easy for me to say that ""Sideways"" might just as well be my favourite comedy of the entire 2000's decade."
1.0,sideways,A great great movie. I love every second of it. So funny with such a great spirit. The pairing of Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church is flawless. I'm not drinking any fucking Merlot!!!
1.0,sideways,"As I'm sure many others did, I misjudged this movie going in. I'm so glad to say that this film completely surprised me. A remarkably well done drama."
1.0,sideways,"One of both mine and my Dad's favourite films to watch together. It's hilarious, truthful, touching and offensive all at once. Ever since watching this, I've been a fan Paul Giamatti. But all the cast is great. It's one of those films that only gets better the more times you watch it."
1.0,sideways,"My personal favorite film of all time, Payne's landmark cinematic achievement is endlessly entertaining, utterly and unbelievably real, anchored by brilliant performances and sustains great replay value, even ten years later."
1.0,sideways,Gets better every time I watch it
1.0,sideways,A great well acted movie
1.0,sideways,"I feel like such a hipster liking this, but it is a truly good movie. Paul Giamatti makes this movie definitely worth watching. if not for the cinematography and great script."
1.0,sideways,"Review To ComeOne of the best movies of all time, certainly of its decade."
1.0,sideways,"Sideways is a spectacular comedy. The chemistry between Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church is just unbelievably hilarious. Plus, the story is told in such an intelligent and fascinating way. Sideways is a comedic classic all on its own."
1.0,sideways,A great Tragi-comedy film that hits all the right dramatic and comic lives of two middle-aged something's on their week sojourn before one gets married. Brilliant performances and direction makes this film highly recommended
1.0,sideways,"Fantastic Character movie about people with real issues and how they deal, or don't deal with them. A great mix of drama and brilliant comedy. The music and photography are equally perfect."
1.0,sideways,One of the best movies ever made
1.0,sideways,"A classic, how did I miss this so many years ago? It's intelligent, moving, and funny."
1.0,sideways,"Sideways is two hours and four minutes of pure wine tasting genius. Just watching it makes me think about planning a trip to Californian wine country, and I usually greatly dislike wine."
1.0,sideways,"Sideways, with its excellent, smart writing and uniformly brilliant performances manages to do what all comedy dramas should aspire: Make you laugh, think and feel all in equal measure."
1.0,sideways,"One of my favorite films. Sideways is as funny as it is deep, and features one of the best performances of all time by Paul Giamatti."
1.0,sideways,one of my favorite movies
1.0,sideways,One of my all time fav movies.
1.0,sideways,"Strong performances spear headed by a star turner in Paul Giamatti, an excellent script and phenomenal directing from Alex Payne and that adds up to being not only an amazing movie, but maybe the best movie about wine of all time"
1.0,sideways,Sideways is a great movie based on a great novel :). I recommend watching it but read the book first
1.0,sideways,"I have been wondering how I can possibly do this lovely, perfect movie justice in a summary, and it seems highly probable that my writing skills will be unequal to the task. So forget it. - This is a masterpiece. Watch it."
1.0,sideways,"Com um roteiro genial e uma direção segura, Payne nos entrega um filme delicioso, com temas delicados e situações inusitadas, com um elenco nunca menos que brilhante, especialmente Paul Giamatti."
1.0,sideways,"I have yet to see a comedy this century so expressive, so profound, and so utterly human."
1.0,sideways,"This film is so beautifully real, so intimate and human, filled with all the humour, misery and conflict that populates our lives. The acting is sublime - this film is made by those long, quiet moments and the tension and affection between the Church and Giamatti. Excellent film."

1.0,sideways,Sideways is far from your typical films. It's well-informed knowledge of Napa's Wine Community and usage of terminology to describe intamacy metaphorically proves that thier was plenty of thought put into making this film. Sandra Oh dazzles as always!
1.0,sideways,"Simultaneously funny and sad, Alexander Payne's story of two unhappy men at the crossroads in their lives is his best movie to date."
1.0,sideways,I just love these morons!

1.0,sideways,"excellent,with very dry humour and a great cast of underrated actors,gimatti steals the filmI love this film it has such a quirky feel to it"
1.0,sideways,"A funny film that makes you care about two extremely flawed (and not just 'movie flawed' - see what Miles does at his mother's house) characters. Cracking dialogue, excellent acting, only as crude as it needs to be and touching.One of my favourite films."
1.0,sideways,"Really clever, beautiful, funny, well-written, sad, real, well-acted...I could go on. Love it."
1.0,sideways,An absolute masterpiece. There is not a single false note in the entire film.
1.0,sideways,Wonderful movie.It proves that you don't need a lot of bells and whistles when you have a good script and good actors.
1.0,sideways,"Baby Boomer coming of age sentiments with the sharpest dialogue, most shameless acting and over the top plot lines. Ridiculous and worth it."
1.0,sideways,Truly the best intelligent male buddy movie. Thomas Hayden Church and Paul Giamatti are superb. The scenery is amazing and it's the movie that got me into wine. It's so funny to see older men who are still stuck in their youth but in a fun way.
1.0,sideways,The complexity and yet simplicity of all the characters gives the audience something you don't see every day. An un-hollywooded version of real life. Add in some beautiful cinematography and you have a movie you can watch over and over again.

1.0,sideways,"A great great film with Giamatti's, and one of the decade's, best performance!"
0.0,sideways,I despised this movie
1.0,sideways,"The most heartfelt comedy in a generation. Paul Giamatti was plucked from relative obscurity to play the role of a lifetime in Alexander Payne's masterpiece, while Haden-Church, Madsen and Oh provide outstanding support. Missing out on Best Picture remains a genuine travesty."
1.0,sideways,an alexander payne masterpiece. very funny r rated comedy. paul giamatti with out a doubt was robbed of an oscar nod. the scene with him and virginia madsen and they are talking wine is so moving.

1.0,sideways,every wine enthusiast and recently divorced MUST watch this movie :) i watched on the plane coming back from Bordeaux and it really resonated with me.
1.0,sideways,"Sideways is a perfect film about love, friendship, commitment and more. Giamatti's performance as Miles is impressive. He's optimistic, depressed, pathetic, and yet so charming and likable."
1.0,sideways,"Pitch-perfect study of mid-life revisionism, last chances, and the reality of road-trips. Glorious, funny, dark-hearted, poignant. A career high for its two leads, Giamatti and Church, and some great performances from all in support, notably Oh."
1.0,sideways,"Sideways is one of those films that's a bit too good to review: It strikes a unique tone, blends a bit of tall-tale fun with everyday life, and pretty much hits every note in your psyche."
1.0,sideways,Love this film...so good.
0.0,sideways,this was a painful painful painful painful experience..the dvd should have came packaged with a book to read while this movie was playing.
1.0,sideways,"This is effing comedy of a different brand. Two best friends trying to figure out their lives in 2 different extreme perspectives. Its an intellectual piece of generic mid life drama and might not work for all viewers, but its definitely worth a try."
1.0,sideways,pura originalidad en el filme
1.0,sideways,"This is a movie that has a bit of everything, all of it great."
1.0,sideways,A laid back film that is perfected in the realm of drama and comedy. This movie should have won best picture in the Oscars by a millimeter.
1.0,sideways,"Delicioso. A amizade dos dois personagens principais é improvável, e por isso mesmo, instigante. Depois de assistir, só tomando um Pinot."

1.0,sideways,Best comedy of it's kind since American Beauty. Perfect movie. My pick for Best Picture at the 2004 Oscars. Giamatti unjustly cheated out of a nomination.

1.0,sideways,"I was eager to see this movie and my expectations were rather high and this movie managed to live up to the hype. It goes to show that a movie is made by the story and characters, not by the money put into it."
1.0,sideways,Excelente Pelicula; quizas de lo mejor que he visto en los ultimos años del cine norteamericano!!!
0.0,sideways,Stopped watching too boring
1.0,sideways,"Deep. Thoughtful. Excellent cast, interesting plot, humorous script. A very accurate feeling portrayal of ""the midlife crisis""."
1.0,sideways,"This movie goes great with red wine. Be sure to have the bottle near by, because it's hard to walk away from this movie. It gets better with age."
0.0,sideways,"I found this movie completely inaccessible. It was painfully slow, elitist and contained two highly unappealing male lead characters (a real shame as I usually enjoy Paul Gambaccini's work). I'm sorry if this makes me philistine but it's over 2 hours of my life I'll never get back! Dreadful."
1.0,sideways,I watched this one late night and I loved it.
1.0,sideways,"I expect more wine in the love story ... actually I expect more love in this wine story ... by the way, just let me finish this glass and enjoy it again and again."

1.0,enough_said_2013,"A mature, heartfelt adult romantic comedy that is able to juggle laughs and romance with real life stakes; never once steeping to melodrama or cliche. One of the late Gandolfini's best performances with typically Brilliant work from Louis-Dreyfus."

1.0,modern_times,A film that even holds a strong message today about industrialization. Notice how in one scene Charlie literally gets swallowed in the mechanical feats of industries...
1.0,modern_times,Chaplin's first foray into social commentary as a narrative structure and he pulls it off stunningly. The perils of the evolution of technology will someday exceed that of human ingenuity.

1.0,modern_times,Classic Chaplin and the first time w hear his voice. The set designs and gags are brilliantly conceived.
1.0,modern_times,"Now almost seventy-five years old, this black-and-white film - almost entirely silent even though talkies had already been prominent for around a decade by then - still feels completely relevant, innovative and brilliant. And that says it all about Chaplin's work - it is one for the ages."
1.0,modern_times,Simply amazing. Best of Chaplin.
1.0,modern_times,There was only one person funnier than Lucille Ball and that person was Charlie Chaplin. Here is his masterpiece (and his last silent film). It's amazing how well it stands up. I laughed my ass off. Genius bit of comedy.

1.0,modern_times,Hvordan bedÃ¸mmer man den nok bedste stumfilm i historien? Det er en genial samfundskritisk film. Som alle Charlie Chaplin film er den hylende sjov og dybt rÃ¸rende! Som altid en skÃ¦rk kommentar til samtiden og eftertiden...

1.0,modern_times,"I think the scene in which Charlie eats cocaine thinking it's sugar is one of the funniest in cinema. Honestly, it's right up there with the presidents phone conversation with the Russian premire in ""Dr. Strangelove""; and with that scene with the two little kids and the coffee in ""Airplane!""."
1.0,modern_times,"Chaplin at his best. They say it's dangerous business to dissect comedy. The great thing about Chaplin's physical comedic perfection is that it just hits you. So much genius so early, it's no wonder he struggled to find his footing in the sound era."

1.0,modern_times,Chaplin era de verdad un genio !!!!
1.0,modern_times,"Modern Times remains Chaplin's most sustained burlesque of authority: It's replete with strikes and police riots, and one of the most celebrated gags has the Tramp inadvertently leading a worker demonstration and being jailed?not for the last time?as an agitator"
1.0,modern_times,Love this film...but love Metropolis even more....without the crappy music they score it to later.
1.0,modern_times,"I can say that this film is easily in my top 3 favorite films ever. I love everything about this film.

1.0,modern_times,"Mas que una comedia, ""Tiempos Modernos"" es un comentario social acerca de la autodestruccion gradual del hombre a partir de la industria. Comidas rapidas, falta de sueno, relaciones afectivas neutralizadas. Hace una pareja perfecta con ""Nous La LibertÃ©"" de RenÃ© Clair."

1.0,modern_times,Modern Times is actually one of the funniest movies I think I've ever seen. There were quite a few laugh out loud moments. And the movie itself was fantastic. The theme of the movie was very well delivered and portrayed. And I thought the ending was absolutely fantastic!
1.0,modern_times,"Hilarious and smart, funny and nostalgic. Just loved it!"
1.0,modern_times,"Excellent film by Charles Chaplin. At times it can be serious, but it is funny all the way to the end."
1.0,modern_times,De las mejores. Una crÃ­tica sobre el abuso del poder ejercido sobre la vida de la clase trabajadora industrial
1.0,modern_times,Una buena critica al la revolución industrial y los tiempos modernos así suene obvio

1.0,modern_times,oh the wonders of charlie chaplin
1.0,modern_times,"One of the best movies of all time, and the best silent & Chaplin movie ever. It has it all. Humor. Innocence. Joy. Moral. Love. And humor again. But most of all brilliance."
1.0,modern_times,The BEST MOVIE EVER!!!
1.0,modern_times,"Like previously mentioned, this is a classic. I showed 15 minutes of it to a class of 17 year-olds and they really liked it. Despite silent comedies being a thing of the past, Chaplin's comedy still can attract an audience of some of the toughest critics."
1.0,modern_times,"Arguably Charlie's best film. Stylish, clever, hilarious, touching...a masterpiece and a personal favourite."
1.0,modern_times,Made me laugh all the way through. Inspires me to look up more Chaplin greats :)
1.0,modern_times,Hilarious satire of our assembly line culture.
1.0,modern_times,"Cinema at it's finest. It entertains, makes you laugh, cry, and forget about your life for a moment in time. This is a work of art, and it's no wonder Charlie Chaplin is legendary. I wish they still made films like this."
1.0,modern_times,como el hombre es reemplazado por la maquina
1.0,modern_times,"""Modern Times"" is a movie that quietly showed a man suffering through a world of change. It is Chaplin's first full sound film and one that brands itself on the souls of all true lovers of the cinema. I loved it!"
1.0,modern_times,"Smile though ur heart is aching, smile even though its breaking...He is a legend, a true artist dont need a voice to convey every emotions needed in each scene, this is a great film, and Mr. Chaplin you are par none, the best in the field.""buck-up, never say die, well get along"
1.0,modern_times,Hilarious. Excellent. Sad. Depressing. Meaningful. Chaplin. This film puts together drama and comedy together with a message about the hardship of jobs and families in the early 1900's. Great film by Charles Chaplin.
1.0,modern_times,never laughed so hard in all of my life
1.0,modern_times,"Charles Chaplin was the best artistic person in the world. I reali love him, and in few months, i will have all the collection ¨^_^"

1.0,modern_times,funniest things i have ever scene
1.0,modern_times,Really enjoyed this movie - Chaplin is a genius!
1.0,modern_times,"Argualby Chaplin's best work (City Lights is painfully close). Romantic and socially aware, while being wonderfully funny."
0.0,modern_times,NO NO NO NO NO NO . Y DA HELL DID I C THIS MOVIE!!
1.0,modern_times,"Fikk magekrampe, brus ut av nesen og tårer i øynene"
1.0,modern_times,Classic Shtick. I want to everything ever made by Chaplin now. I loved it.
1.0,modern_times,We still laugh at these films today. Chapin knew how to write timeless films.
1.0,modern_times,I love when the Tramp gets wound up in machine gears then goes completely insane when he comes out.
1.0,modern_times,"I don't care what you think. It's bloody great. (The camerawork, considering the cameras available, is astonishing.) Cog in the machine, indeed."
1.0,modern_times,Come si fa a commentare un genio?
1.0,modern_times,"Chaplin once again manages to pull off a fantastic film mixing sight gags with political commentary. And like another great comedian George Carlin, was anti technology."
1.0,modern_times,Un filme que aplica para cualquier tipo de estudio y para cualquier tipo de gusto. Chaplin pierde la cabeza intentando trabajando en una fabrica. Te suena a algo familiar a lo que te ocurre diariamente?
1.0,modern_times,I absolutely love this movie. I was lucky enough to stumble on it when it was showing on TCM while flipping through channels and the superb talent of Chaplin made my jaw drop to the floor. He set the bar for physical comedy that no one can come close to these days.
1.0,modern_times,"It amazes me how Chaplin is able to write, direct, choreograph, act, and compose and everything else all equally perfectly."
1.0,modern_times,My favorite Chaplin film!
1.0,modern_times,Chaplin gets coked up and slaps some dudes around.
1.0,modern_times,"Charlie Chaplin ingests a lot of cocaine in this movie, and I'm not joking. This is fantasmagorical."
1.0,modern_times,One of the best and funniest films I've watched. Truly a classic.
1.0,modern_times,"Amazing comedy. A beautiful portrayal of struggle and the unending fight to persevere. Always keeping his chin up, the Tramp encounters obstacles, love, and failure. Charlie works in the details and it shows. My favorite Chaplin film."
1.0,modern_times,"This film is brilliantly funny and very well-put together. It's the first Charlie Chaplin movie I've seen, and he's fantastic. The way he uses his body as a prop, the way he reveals feelings physically instead of verbally, and his complete understanding of comedy makes him a total genius."
1.0,modern_times,Nice movie..Entertaining
1.0,modern_times,"I WILL SAY ONLY ONE THING: IF YOU LOVE CINEMA, PLEASE SEE THAT MOVIE!!!!!! I YOU DON'T, SEE IT TOO!"
1.0,modern_times,"DrÃ´le, tendre et malgrÃ© tout fÃ©roce... Tout ce que j'aime."

1.0,modern_times,my favorite Chaplin film. superb mix of his slapstick humor and sociopolitical commentary. you gotta love the feeding machine!
1.0,modern_times,Genuine film genius.
1.0,modern_times,The ups and severe downs of life in the era of modernization and economic depression. The film itself is a farewell to silent cinema. Chaplin's final silent does feature sound though (through a memorable song and interesting sound effect gags).
1.0,modern_times,"One of the best film EVER. Chaplin is a master, capable of make the audience laugh, cry and think deeply to modern society's problems. It is not the first movie to deal with the theme of mand and industrialization, but it does it in Chaplin's ""deep lightness"" unique style."
1.0,modern_times,"Jo, Â¡quÃ© manera de reÃ­r en la escena de la mÃ¡quina que da de comer el almuerzo! :D:D:D:DLagrimones como kiwis me caÃ­an."
1.0,modern_times,"one of the most inventive ""silent"" films."
1.0,modern_times,this crap is so funny if its old and they had alittle thing about crack and well its the funniest thing i have ever scene
1.0,modern_times,"Friggin hilarious. This is the third Chaplin movie I've seen over the past few months, and all three have been fantastic. Fantastic timing and great physical comedy. The eating machine scene alone is funnier than 23 modern comedies combined. (I'll say it, you suck Jim Carey.)"
1.0,modern_times,"The best Chaplin movie, and that's high praise."
1.0,modern_times,Es chaplin... que mas queres. Inigualable este tipo

1.0,modern_times,One of my favorite movies ever made
1.0,modern_times,"My favorite Chaplin film. Though the plot may be a little episodic for some I think it represents the best of his talents. Great slapstick, great pathos, great music, very creative and very satirical."
1.0,modern_times,my favorite chaplin film so far. intelligent & hilarious.
1.0,modern_times,"so good! after all these years, still thrills, amuses, inspires and stuns."
1.0,modern_times,"Perfect film that keeps you entertained the entire hour and 43 minutes. Chaplin's funniest film, in my opinion with smart gags, such as the communist bit."
1.0,modern_times,Superbe et - malheureusement - toujours d'une certaine actualite...
1.0,modern_times,Chaplin genial. Una película que hay que ver al menos una vez en la vida.
1.0,modern_times,L'ultimo film di Chaplin in cui c'era il suo personaggio del Tramp e il film in cui finalmente sentiamo lui parlare... in una scena meravigliosamente affascinante in cui lui canta per... come sempre... noi.
1.0,modern_times,TrÃ¨s grand classique :-)
1.0,modern_times,A fitting and phenomenal last film of Charlie Chaplin's tramp character.
1.0,modern_times,"Unlike George Orwell, Chaplin will make you cry and laugh! Why shouldn't social commentary and slapstick go hand in hand? The combo make for a much easier pill to swallow!"
1.0,modern_times,"Chaplin was funny, and smart he was the originator had his own style that really works"
1.0,modern_times,i haven't laughed so hard in a long time.

1.0,modern_times,Just a beautiful movie
1.0,modern_times,"If you don't know anything about Chaplin, there's no better way to learn than to feast your eyes on this classic. He puts so much into his role that he makes you want to see what he's got up his sleeve for his next trick."
1.0,modern_times,chaplin at the hight of his powers
1.0,modern_times,"Just adorable. Like a human cartoon. Charlie Chaplin...wicked fantastic. I felt like a kid watching this movie. A real treat for all ages. Still funny, still beautiful, still astounding by today's standards."
1.0,modern_times,This is the funniest movie ever!
1.0,modern_times,Man against machine in the Depression. The automation of life and the loss of self. The Tramp and cocaine. Chaplin tossed 'em in a bag and produced one of the funniest and most biting movies ever.
1.0,modern_times,sooo beautiful! the last sequence is probably the best in movie history.
1.0,modern_times,Probably my favourite Chaplin movie. The nose powder scene was brilliant!
1.0,modern_times,My Favorite Of ALL Times
1.0,modern_times,"Chaplin's first semi-talkie movie,shows how the machine ""technology"" brainwashes us."
1.0,modern_times,"Oh, Chaplin, there is little more I can say about you. Other than you're probably the best damn comedian...ever."
1.0,modern_times,Watch this movie when foreclosure hits you. Things haven't changed bit.
1.0,modern_times,"What can I say about ""Modern Times""? Everything was already told."
1.0,modern_times,Perfect. Chaplin never lets me down.
1.0,modern_times,"Top notch movie, we still suffer the same issues. Shame we didn't learn from what Chaplin was trying to tell us. Definitely my favorite and sadly the last silent movie he did."

0.0,1009096-hairspray,I didn't like this version of the film. I think I expected something more going into it and I was further disappointed. I like what the story is trying to do but the execution of the recent Broadway show and movie make it a story more people may enjoy.
1.0,1009096-hairspray,All John Water films are entertaining. Just LOVE his work.

0.0,1009096-hairspray,I can't believe the ratings this movie has. One of the worst films I've ever seen. Debbie Harry was the only good thing about this movie.
1.0,1009096-hairspray,"Beautiful film, I could watch it over and over again because its so funny and genuine. Much better than the 2007 remake which turned all the subtle beauty of the original and made it into an over the top cheezefest..."

1.0,1009096-hairspray,Fantastic!!! Streaks ahead of the new 2007 version. Ricki Lake is excellent in the main role and the other cast members provide brilliant support. I thought the new version was just rubbish. Please give the 2007 version a miss and go straight for the original.

1.0,1009096-hairspray,"Another Waters' classic. This ""60s"" era romp is not only fun, but takes a poke at mainstream society and makes a commentary at racism in the process. One of the more accessible films from Waters, Ricki Lake is a great tracy turnblat, and Divine is simply divine as her mother Edna."

1.0,zootopia,"I have to say that I love great animated films perhaps more than live action great films. I don't know why. I think its because, if done right they can be so emotionally powerful, like this film, and other like it such as ""Inside Out"" and ""The Lion King"" ."

1.0,before_sunrise,Love the poetry and symbolism of the stories and things they encounter.
1.0,before_sunrise,Richard Linklater has the amazing ability to make movies with few notable events that enchant the audience with intriguing dialogue alone. The chemistry in this movie feels real.

1.0,before_sunrise,Pretty much a perfect film. Nothing about it ever felt forced. Every single other romantic film should compare itself to this and weep.
1.0,before_sunrise,"This film, this series, should be much, much bigger than it is. It's up there with the best. It is seriously talented film-making, from all involved. Nobody should question the romantic comedy genre until they've walked through France with Ethan and Julie."

1.0,before_sunrise,"Probably not a life or mind altering movie. But it was sweet, and had its fleeting deep moments, and had a little sense of beauty to it that maybe it wouldn't have had anywhere but Europe."
0.0,before_sunrise,One of the most boring movies I 've seen. There is nothing fresh or original about it. If romantic means tons of cliché marvelously piled one on top of the other I guess the script nailed it. Never got why so many people like this particular movie.

1.0,before_sunrise,"A beautiful story of boy-meets-girl. But they don't know that is the ""moment"" of perfect union of heart and mind. Life is likely to take them afar, but nothing would add to the sparkling lightness of their first love."
1.0,before_sunrise,Love story at it's candid best
1.0,before_sunrise,"I loved this movie. It was just too pleasant and endearing to simply dismiss as an average romance film, which it certainly wasn't. I believed in the romance between this couple more than I did in most Hollywood romance pictures."

1.0,before_sunrise,Linklater paints the picture of the relationship we would all like to have and it is aware of that.

1.0,before_sunrise,"I can't help it but this is such a romantic, beautiful movie"

1.0,before_sunrise,Jesse and Celine walk along the streets of Vienna as theycompletely and unobtrusively swept each other off their feet (and yours as well); mesmerizing you from beginning to end.
1.0,before_sunrise,"The material is good enough to hold its own against any classic romantic film, but due to the genre going down the crapper since the 80s and beyond, it probably won't be seen as the classic it truly is.  Personally, I think it's one of the finest romances since 'Casablanca.'"
1.0,before_sunrise,A memorable and magical romance that one swishes would never end.

1.0,before_sunrise,Before Sunrise perfectly captures the euphoria of falling in love. It may be the most romantic movie I've ever seen.
0.0,before_sunrise,"The worst - fast forwarded through last half to see if it got any better - insipid dialogue - booooring, he's a jerk, who could be interested. If I met him on a train, I would run."
1.0,before_sunrise,the movie is a surreal experience with two of the most well written and played characters I have seen on screen. the plot is minimalist and is basically just the two leads walking around Vienna and talking and yet I have never been more interested. Great film.

1.0,before_sunrise,"Interesante en la medida en la Richard Linklater resuelve la totalidad de una relaciÃ³n y sus facetas en un amorÃ­o de una sola noche. Las vidas de cada uno de los personajes viÃ (C)ndose enfrentada en un ""Standby"" de la vida cotidiana, dÃ¡ndose a lugar un amor ligado al espacio, la cuidad."
1.0,before_sunrise,I want to cry I watch Before Sunset first. This is the kind of movie I'm sure I will be watching over again. Ohhhh. I don't know you can feel love with just watching two people acting to be in genuine connection. That's how real it is.

1.0,before_sunrise,"it's bold, interesting and unique... great job by both Hawke and Delpy..."
1.0,before_sunrise,"Before Sunrise is a romantic film but it follows almost no romantic genre convention. Yes, we know the characters will fall in love, but they are so convincing and three dimensional that the journey is a delight to watch. Richard Linklater's writing is typically engaging and philosophical."

1.0,before_sunrise,I love this movie! Gets me every time. :)
1.0,before_sunrise,"Linklater is so good, I watched this before I knew anything about him (slacker and dazed and confused are awesome!). He went on to make amazing films. The dialogue is so natural and flowing, but it's a sad story."

1.0,before_sunrise,What is not to like about this movie? As a dialogue-driven film it has some amazing imagery and stunning performances. Hawk and Deply are riveting and alluring in this star crossed lovers tale.

1.0,before_sunrise,"Simple, yet brilliant."
1.0,before_sunrise,i enjoyed the story and it was quite sad watching the conclusion. the film leaves the whole story up in the air not knowing what ever happened to these love birds. ethan hawke is just so likable and the chemistry between the two is so believable. this is one film you should watch as a couple
1.0,before_sunrise,"Uma obra tão natural e íntima, que fica impossível não terminar o filme com uma sensação de abandono."

1.0,before_sunrise,"simple, without-plan moments are the best in life, full of magic and everything that trully matters..."
0.0,before_sunrise,movie that had no point to it at all.
1.0,before_sunrise,"Nothing else quite catches the true essence of romance like Before Sunrise did. Along with its witty dialogue and showcase of great chemistry between Delphy and Hawke, it captures the heart of the audience, giving its wholesome insights about love, the most general and vague topic one could take."
1.0,before_sunrise,"Unless you're completely braindead, it's surely impossible not to love this movie. I was dismayed to find that Julie Delpy's somewhat of a bitch as a person, because I fell in love with her character as much as Ethan Hawke's character did."
0.0,before_sunrise,"Two fundamentally unlikeable people meet on a train, then a spend a day together spouting philosophical bullshit. When they occasionally encounter other people, those people are also annoying. Tremendously smug and hateful."

1.0,before_sunrise,One of my all time favorite movies. Enough said!!!
1.0,before_sunrise,Wow!! What A Refreshing Beautiful Film! Before Sunrise just feels so beautifully set in the back drop of Vienna where everything just feels timeless. The Intellectual musing and just talking of two people getting to know each other is enough to be called an engaging Masterpiece.
1.0,before_sunrise,A total feel good movie! Loved every bit of it. A wonderful journey that I would to experience it myself!
1.0,before_sunrise,"The best romantic film that I had ever seen to that point. I fell for the character of Celine even as I sympathized somewhat with Jesse, this film jumpstarted my interest in Julie Delpy's career as an actress and director!"

1.0,broadcast_news,"This is just amazing work. James L. Brooks is very, very good.Why this fuck this movie profile flixter's given has the director listed as it's lead I don't know. Someone's an idiot. I'm writing them."
1.0,broadcast_news,One of those movies that can't be remade because any remake would pale in comparison. Great cast and many funny moments. A must-see for anyone in the news industry.
1.0,broadcast_news,This movie is just... perfect.
1.0,broadcast_news,Albert Brooks is my hero.
1.0,broadcast_news,"One of my favourite ever films. William Hurt, despite having lost all his hair now, was just lovely back in 1987 - but he did really need Albert Brooks' personality! Best line ""I say it here, it come out there...."""
0.0,broadcast_news,"Barf. James L. Brooks, just as in his vomit fest ""As Good As It Gets,"" creates 3 of the most annoying characters, then makes a 2 hour+ movie about them. Holy shit I barfed again."
1.0,broadcast_news,This movie is pretty much a perfect blend of comedy and drama.
1.0,broadcast_news,Karaktärerna är inte särskilt trevliga men jag älskar dem alla.
1.0,broadcast_news,Why can't I stop watching this movie? Maybe because it feels like my personality split three-for-one into the main characters
1.0,broadcast_news,"Flop sweat, morality questions, and Holly Hunter's accent all in one flick . . . what's not to love?"
1.0,broadcast_news,"A beautiful script, well-acted and well-shot. Hey, it won the oscar."
1.0,broadcast_news,Fucking brilliant. This honest and hysterical portrait of a love triangle and broadcasters... and Holly Hunter is a smoke show.
1.0,broadcast_news,"the best ""real to life"" romantic comedy there is"
1.0,broadcast_news,"Might as well start with one of my favourite movies of all time... Set in a newsroom, and full of not-very-nice people, it's a total must-see... Aaron trying to anchor the weekend news is a comedy classic!"
1.0,broadcast_news,"a funny, realistic look at the industry and making it appealing by incorporating interesting characters. it's scary to realize that the issues realized in this movie still hold true in broadcast news today."
1.0,broadcast_news,"Yes, it's a romantic comedy, of sorts. Stellar work by all of the leads, especially Albert Brooks who was ROBBED of an Oscar that year."
1.0,broadcast_news,"Best work of Albert Brooks's career. Smart script, excellent acting. Near perfection."
1.0,broadcast_news,I think this is better than Network because Network is less relevant satire. TV is fluff not devilishly violent. This film is misrepresented by the farcical tape delivery scene that is always used to describe it.
1.0,broadcast_news,This is the movie that made me want to do what I do. Holly Hunter is brilliant.
1.0,broadcast_news,Great film and great characters. Witty script. Can watch it again and again.
1.0,broadcast_news,"""I say it here and it comes out there."" It turned out that James L Brooks' view of the media was not cynical at all. In hindsight he looks like an optimist. (PS, whowever put the detail in that the director was Albert Brooks is an idiot.)"
1.0,broadcast_news,This is a painfully funny look at real life through the media news industry. Some of the funniest scenes of all time (Cusack running the tape and Brooks sweating) are in this film with excellent performances by the leads.
1.0,broadcast_news,Such a nice movie full of great characters. Even Holly Hunters whining voice doesn't grate in this one. Jack Nicholson appears uncredited because he knew this was such a damn nice film to flash his grin in.

1.0,broadcast_news,"Holly Hunter was robbed! She was certainly better than Cher, that's for sure, but we won't discuss that Oscar travesty here.  This is also another chance to see William Hurt at thet top of his game. If you're not a fan of him yet, you will be by the end of the movie!"
1.0,broadcast_news,"A perfect film, with one jaw-droppingly well-crafted scene after another. Its incomparable mix of comedy and pathos is something to aspire to, and the performances are fantastic. Yes folks, I'd say I'm pretty gay for this movie."
1.0,broadcast_news,"This movie is a study in subtext. A must see for actors, aspiring or veteran. The subject matter is almost exclusively about news, but the story is about romance, sex and infatuation. It is also on of the funniest performances by Albert Brooks, which says alot."

1.0,dr_strangelove,"The Godfather of modern satire and black comedy films. More clever than funny (as a good satire should be), Kubrick's razor sharp script somehow manages not to seem all too outlandish in the midst of Cold War hysteria, yet so ridiculous that the film doesn't lose its humorous side."

0.0,dont_think_twice,Yeah I won't think twice about watching this movie again.
0.0,dont_think_twice,Cheesy and not remotely funny or witty. The characters were annoying talentless hams. Guaranteed to make you loathe improv. I could not stomach more than 20 minutes of this. I had to watch an episode of Southpark as an antidote.

0.0,dont_think_twice,"This movie was like watching morning TV, noisy and loud. It couldn't end fast enough. I'm a fan of 'The Naked Gun' kind of funny. I laughed in this movie at the end at how bad it was and at the ridiculous rating of 99% fresh on the TOMATOMETER"
1.0,dont_think_twice,"Great movie. Deep, but led by a simple and comedic theme.This may be odd, but the movie reminded me of Shallow Grave - just the comedic version of a movie about friendship.A few scenes felt a little forced sometimes, but never enough to detract from the central themes or ruin the moment."

0.0,dont_think_twice,I'm sorry. This is one of the most boring movies i have ever seen. I wanted to leave and hang out with people who didn't feel sorry for themselves. Don't see if you are a normal person who doesn't hate your life. Not funny at all either.

1.0,1017641-risky_business,this is one of my favorite movie.
1.0,1017641-risky_business,One of the best Tom Cruise movies. Like how Tom Cruise goes from being a whimp to a man by having a hooker stay at his house. The soundtrack plays really well into the story as well. Great example of growing up and having worries in life and overcoming them.

1.0,1017641-risky_business,"Being born in 1969, this movie set the tone for high school in the mid 80s. So you're parents are going out of town..."
1.0,1017641-risky_business,"One of my favorite soundtracks ever, by Tangerine Dream. Takes the genre of the Wild Comedy and deconstructs/reinvents. Sophisticated play on adolescent fears about sex. One of the most underrated films of all time. Perfect performances."
1.0,1017641-risky_business,Classic unlike any other.
1.0,1017641-risky_business,Five just for the old rock N roll scene...

1.0,1017641-risky_business,"Absolutely flawless movie. Loved every second of it. Cruise shines as he starts off his career with a bang in this funny, thrilling, and erotic through a weekend without the 'rents."

1.0,1017641-risky_business,"Love , Love , Love Tom Cruise"
1.0,1017641-risky_business,It's ok if you don't like this movie cause its not intended to be a movie for girls . If your a guy and you don't like this move than you should refer to the first sentence. I just wish that Paul Brickman didn't cave into the producers desire of a typical American Happy ending.
1.0,1017641-risky_business,"What IS this movie? Is it simply a Bildungsroman? A comedy? A drama? Whatever it is, it strikes up deep feelings in one scene, yet is completely cheesy and over the top in another. A great interpretation on ""maturing"" from being a teenager."
1.0,1017641-risky_business,"After Magnolia, the best Tom Cruise movie ever. Strikes a perfect balance between funny and unsettling. Brilliant."
1.0,1017641-risky_business,I don't know what it is about this movie... i don't even like tom cruise.
0.0,1017641-risky_business,"Hum .. dunno. It´s ok I guess, but nothing special."

1.0,1017641-risky_business,"Awesome. ""You know, Bill, there's one thing I learned in all my years. Sometimes you just gotta say, ""What the fuck, make your move."" """
1.0,1017641-risky_business,"(4.5 stars... sigh) Timeless classic about a college-bound high school senior who meets an interesting woman, and watches his life turn completely around. When comedy, provocation, and 80's teen humor collide, you get an inspirational flick that never ceases to please."
1.0,1017641-risky_business,Its not that risky 2 watch
1.0,1017641-risky_business,"I can't stand Tom Cruise, I never could! But, running a brothel while Mom & Dad are out of town definaely takes the cake!"
1.0,1017641-risky_business,"A fun movie that picks up where ""The Graduate"" left off. Completely captures Regan-era values in an off-beat and entertaining way."
1.0,man_without_a_past,"Kaurismaki's originality, especially in pacing and cool lines, is in full bloom in this picture. Also, the cinematography, lighting, and the set design is just awesome. High quality in every angle."
1.0,man_without_a_past,"One of the best I have seen in recent times..just felt so much watching this, like reading a great novel. Masterpiece!"
0.0,man_without_a_past,"Ja mitähän ihmiset (=kriitikot) Aki näissä Kaurismäen leffoissa näkee? Kaikki näyttelijät näytti siltä kuin olisivat lukeneet vuorosanansa suoraan paperista koko leffan ajan. Ainoa valonpilkahdus oli Antti Reini, joka vilahti ruudussa 15 sekkaa."
1.0,man_without_a_past,"Awesome film with full of atmosphere! Awesome and personal dialogue, great soundtrack and camera working is great. Many American filmmakers should learn from this one! It beats many films easily! Absolutely one of the greatest Finnish films ever!"
1.0,man_without_a_past,"Kaurismaki once again uses his imaginative deadpan humor and somewhat low-key acting to tell a story of a man, M, who after a brutal beating loses his memory and starts afresh in a way that charms its viewers and tugs at their heart at the same time."
1.0,man_without_a_past,"Five stars. Great movie - great story, phenomenally acted, superbly filmed. Anyone who sees this will become a great fan of Kaurismaki. Dramatic, funny, memorable."
1.0,man_without_a_past,"The Man Without A Past raises a question, ""what would make a changed better man?"" A rather odd but interesting lovely story that delineates past, present, and future. Vivid, subtle characters blessed with sincere humanity and profound personalities. Hilarious. Brilliant. Compelling."
1.0,man_without_a_past,This film is a quiet revolution. Quiet revolts of the characters against the existing system. A simple and modest movie but tailors a powerful message for the audience.
1.0,man_without_a_past,"Master piece!I was told this was a really sad movie. On the contrary, I think it is quite optimistic. Maybe they didn't got the black humor."
1.0,man_without_a_past,"Oh man, I love this movie. I really need to see more Kaurismaki. ""The Man Without A Past"" feels a bit like a much gentler and sunnier circa-""Twin Peaks"" Lynch. One of my new favorites. Funny and sad and beautiful and perfect."
1.0,man_without_a_past,This movie was simply delightful. It has the quirkiness of Northern Exposure but with a somewhat Bergman solemness.
1.0,man_without_a_past,Absolutely loved this movie!!!!
0.0,man_without_a_past,Is that the way people communicate in Finland? I used to have a pen-pal there! Boring Boring. What amazed the critics to reward such a movie?
1.0,man_without_a_past,"Realistic, sensitive but optimistic too!"
1.0,man_without_a_past,"it may take a few attempts to view the film fully, for it does appear to be slow; but eventually like any epiphany, there will be ""light"". . . ."
1.0,man_without_a_past,"It's a jumble of music, from Japanese enka to rock n roll. And I loved the dry yet so romantic relationship slowly growing!!! So my most fav movie of this year."
1.0,man_without_a_past,"A beautiful masterpiece showing the equally huge importance of each and every human being and how much optimism can be found in reality. (The few surreal twists exist only due to theatrical reasons, to me)"
1.0,man_without_a_past,"It's highly stylized and quirky with a heavy dose of film noir. The 'rock & roll' moments are brilliant as is the minimal script full of some very funny one-liners. If you like Jim Jarmusch and Nordic black humour, this ones for you!"
1.0,man_without_a_past,typical aki's movie faces
1.0,man_without_a_past,"A great movie, full of the fatality, hope and humour that make life what it is."
0.0,man_without_a_past,This isn't funny. At all. The pace was so slow that I watched 30mins and then fast-forwarded the rest of the hour with the subtitles on. Needed more dialogue. I don't understand why this is so highly rated. What's wrong with you people?!
1.0,man_without_a_past,Wonderful film about what really matters in our lives when everything is stripped away.
1.0,man_without_a_past,A beautiful film. I like to watch with my Finnish girlfriend. Kaunis elokuva. Minusta se on mukava katsoa sitÃ¤ minun suomalaisen tyttÃ¶ystÃ¤vÃ¤neni kanssa.

1.0,man_without_a_past,What it lacks in dialogue it makes up for with dark and humerous hypercorrect literal language. Awesome
1.0,man_without_a_past,The master's masterpiece. Enough said.
1.0,man_without_a_past,"I've only seen three KaurismÃ¤ki films, and this one is definitely my favorite. The story is touching while still hilarious, and the film itself is beautifully crafted and brilliant."
1.0,man_without_a_past,"awsome! i think it s such an optimistic movie! it just points out that you can always start it again, built a new life with or without memories!"
1.0,man_without_a_past,"oh so silent, oh so simple, oh so nice, oh so good. good, good, good!"
1.0,man_without_a_past,I don't like trying to be an expert in reviewing! I think the film was funny and sad at the same time in such a brilliant way!

1.0,man_without_a_past,"An absolute treat visually and a proper feelgood film - not Hollywood feelgood but KaurismÃ¤ki's no-nonsense feelgood. Bear with it and it will reward you brilliantly. The humour is not exactly slapstick but it is ""seriously funny""."
1.0,man_without_a_past,Americans will have to open their minds a little but the story telling is magnificent and beautifully shot.
0.0,man_without_a_past,"I know as a fellow Fin I'm supposed to love this movie, but I just can't say that I do. I know a lot of other peope did. Good for Aki."

1.0,man_without_a_past,"BINGO.I love it, love it love it!!"
1.0,man_without_a_past,Itâ??s the dry wit of these northern countries which I like. It is just so well acted and crafted without having to use any special effects. There is hardly any action but what happens says it all. Either you hate it or you love it. I love it!
1.0,man_without_a_past,its a brilliant movie. it depresses you until the end and still releases you with a smile.
1.0,man_without_a_past,This movie gave me a lot.

1.0,man_without_a_past,"KaurismÃ¤ki knows what he is doing. Favorite actors, well made story, beautifl music, visualy a piece of art. Though you have to be a Finn to be able to understand many of the jokes. Some may open up to you but many are inside jokes. Like famous Finns who are acting in the movie: MP etc."

1.0,the_artist,Amazing acting & score.
1.0,the_artist,"Even it is a black-and-white silent movie; it is a witty and jolly movie to watch. It has a great story and peculiar visual style. With great performances from Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo, it is surely a masterpiece from Michel Hazanavicius."

1.0,the_artist,"Great movie. It was quite inovative for our time (which is funny considering it is essentially a silent film). Great acting, quite comedic but yet with a serious story to it. It did feel quite foreign to the ears though, watching a movie that had no sound to except the music."

1.0,the_artist,I didn't expect that at all. Really good movie.
0.0,the_artist,I didn't like this movie at all. All movies should have sound in them not wait until the very end. You can't feel the emotions of the actors and actresses without hearing them. You have to keep your eye on the screen the WHOLE time and it isn't fun to just watch a movie.
1.0,the_artist,So happy I saw this. Best movie of 2011.
1.0,the_artist,Yeah. It's really that good.

1.0,the_artist,"The Artist is a genuine rarity of a masterpiece, a french perspective on American silent film, and there is absolutely no shock behind how it won best film of the year during the academy awards of 2012, as it's spirited, charming, and executed with the utmost skill."
1.0,the_artist,"Excelente, brillante, magistral, cautivadora, sorprendente; esa y mil palabras más se merece como adjetivo calificativo ""El artista"". Una hermosa obra de arte."
1.0,the_artist,"A great film that shows just how simple it is to tell a great story. I feel like this film is a outcry to studios that you don't need parlor tricks, CGI, and cheesy stories to make something entertaining. Highly recommended and a must-see for any fan of cinema or filmmaking."

1.0,the_artist,"The only movie besides The Return of the King to make me have full on sobs of joy. An original, light-hearted movie that explains the change in technology and filmmaking in the 20s. Instead of tugging at heart strings, it basically ripped mine out."

0.0,the_artist,Horrible ! Campy foo foo garbage that critics eat up ! This was boring and unwatchable ! From the beginning it did not capture me at all. Total disinterest from the start ! Please Hollywood don't subject the movie goer to this kind of crap again !
0.0,the_artist,"How many Academy members' dick's got sucked for this to win Best Movie and Best Actor??? A truly terrible experience and is almost guaranteed to put you to sleep. Insomniacs, this movie was made for you."
1.0,the_artist,An excellent take on silent movies with a modern twist and sensibilities.
1.0,the_artist,There's nothing greater for movie fans but a movie about those who love cinema. It doesn't hurt that it's told in an original way.

0.0,the_artist,I've seen my first and last silentmovie.
0.0,the_artist,"Chalk it up to another frightfully dull, non-envelope-pushing, cheerfully middlebrow Oscar-winner. For a proper tribute to silent filmmaking there's Guy Maddin, the B&W; sequence in Pedro Almodovar's ""Talk to Her"" and few else."
1.0,the_artist,"One of the best movies depicting the history of silent cinema, The Artist is touching and charming throughout."
1.0,the_artist,Absolutely an enjoyable lost art form.

0.0,duck_soup,"Well, I didn't laugh."
1.0,duck_soup,The Greatest Comedy of all time. This 1933 Film set the standard for all comedy to come. The Four Marx Brothers were brilliant.
1.0,duck_soup,The Greatest Comedy of All Time. No contest
1.0,duck_soup,"Dunno what certain critics have against this masterpiece. Duck Soup is a hilarious example of a feature comedy which has hardly dated over the years (yeah yeah, black and white, but films like Ed Wood, Sin City and Control are B/W as well and they're modern)!"
1.0,duck_soup,Hilarious over all. Witty diolauge and slapstick all around.
1.0,duck_soup,Greatest comedy film ever made.
1.0,duck_soup,my fave pre-code Marx brothers
1.0,duck_soup,"Out of the Marx Brothers estimable body of work, Duck Soup may be the funniest."
1.0,duck_soup,"One of the funniest and most clever movies of all time with practically every joke hitting its mark, Duck Soup not only shows the Marx brothers at their best but also comedy at its best."
1.0,duck_soup,A fun and goofy film with great one liners. Sadly those one liners and sight gags get old after a while and you see the story doesn't have enough beef.
1.0,duck_soup,"Almost unbelievably hilarious, ""Duck Soup"" is characterized by surrealist sight gags, mile-a-minute non sequiturs, and an overabundance of wit that has, and will continue, to stand the test of time as one of the greatest comedies ever produced."
1.0,duck_soup,"A hysterical comedy. Go watch it, you'll be glad you did"
1.0,duck_soup,A comedic masterwork. it just never lets up

0.0,duck_soup,"My first Marx Brothers movie, and I could not stand it."
1.0,duck_soup,It's like watching a live action looney tunes.
1.0,duck_soup,This just might be the Marx Bros. funniest movie.
0.0,duck_soup,"This was like watching an American version of a very long Ismail Yasin Sketch, where events unfold to allow the main character (Groucho) to throw one joke after the other, of which I laughed at none. And for some weird reason Chicho and Harpo Marx reminded me of Mimo and Gamal Ramsis"
1.0,duck_soup,"Funny, funny movie. A must watch."
1.0,duck_soup,The best Marx Brothers film period. I love the mirror scene and Groucho's sarcasm makes me crack up.

1.0,duck_soup,"marx brothers deserve nothing but 5 stars, atleast every 20 seconds i was laughing out loud"
1.0,duck_soup,I don't know how anybody could watch this film and fail to love it it's just simply hilarious. Duck Soup is one of the rare films that has stood the test of time and can still make an audience laugh almost 80 years after it's original release.
1.0,duck_soup,"Simply the funniest film ever made. Extraordinarily daring and way ahead of its time. A strong pacifistic statement on the lunacy of war. Aptly displays the greatest comedy team of all time. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor, and do so immediately. Long live Freedonia!"
1.0,duck_soup,The best movie to see on election night! Freedonia rules. Rufus Firefly for president.
1.0,duck_soup,"Immensely humorous, with great subtext."

1.0,duck_soup,The Marx Brothers are fantastic. There's very few things that can make me laugh this hard and this style of comedy is one of them. Laughs from open to close.
1.0,duck_soup,Very clever movie. Groucho's witty banter is only exceeded by the silent physical comedy. I haven't smiled this much during a movie in a long time if ever.
1.0,duck_soup,One of the funniest and most clever movies ever made!
1.0,duck_soup,"has to be the funniest movie ever..pips my all time fav ""The big lebowski"" to the post..The one liners from the movie have been used for time immemorable.."

1.0,duck_soup,"This is the funniest film I've ever seen in my entire life. My favourite part in this is when a woman says to Groucho:  ""You are trying my PATIENCE!""  And Groucho comes back with:  - ""Oh Yeah? You must come round to me next week and try mine!"""

1.0,duck_soup,"Combining witty, political humor with bafflingly off-the-wall scenes, this classic Marx Brothers movie is one of the most astonishingly funny movies ever made."
1.0,duck_soup,Hilarious and ahead of its time. The mirror scene and the final battle are standouts in this amusingly silly satire of war and politics.
1.0,duck_soup,Probably the greatest comedy movie ever. If you don't like this movie you probably don't have much of a sense of humor.
1.0,duck_soup,my favorite marx brother film. if you want funny this will suffice. its quick witted and hilarious. the mirror scene may well be my favorite movie scene to date. enjoy
1.0,duck_soup,"Even if you've never seen this movie, you've seen countless references to it over the years. This is comedy genius."
1.0,duck_soup,Why was I not interested in this film? I'm glad I got to see this in a movie theater - the way it was intended to be seen. I was literally laughing the entire way through. It was one of the funniest I've ever seen. Great job for 1933. Marx brothers are amazing.
1.0,duck_soup,if you are feeling low and you have nothing to do watch Duck soup it will never fail to cheer you up and laughyour head up. It is my second favorite marx brothers film after night at the opera. It also benefits from having all the Marx brothers with the obvious exception of Gummo.
1.0,duck_soup,Three words: The mirror scene.
1.0,duck_soup,The Marx Brothers are a laught a minute.
1.0,duck_soup,"My pick for funniest movie ever! I can watch it again and again, 75 years after release, and every joke is well written and perfectly delivered! Hail Freedonia!"
1.0,duck_soup,"Story doesn't matter at all to the Marx brothers but it is a good excuse to film some of the most absurd and entertaining antics to ever grace the screen. Nothing but constant gags and yes, the famous 'mirror' scene is pretty damn funny."
1.0,duck_soup,Humor has its pinnacle; it's known as Duck Soup.
1.0,duck_soup,"I take back everything bad I've ever said about the Marx Brothers. This has gotta be the boldest, most ridiculous and manic, and most ahead of its time piece of comedy of the first half of the 20th century, with W.C. Fields' Never Give a Sucker an Even Break really being its only competition."
1.0,duck_soup,"They are all wonderful, but this under-rated Marx Brothers classic out-shines them all! Brilliantly chaotic and hilarious!"
1.0,duck_soup,The Marx brothers doing what they do best!

1.0,duck_soup,Duck Soup is brilliant. An anti war film from the 30s featuring the Marx Brothers in one of their best comedic outings.
1.0,duck_soup,My favorite Marx Brothers movie of all time. Duck Soup is as fresh today as it was in 1933. Hilarious and a great anti war movie. Every politician needs to see it so they can see how ridiculous war is. The brothers at their best.
1.0,duck_soup,"A comedy classic! The best feature from the brothers Marx, in which Groucho plays the leader of Fredonia and declares war on a neighboring country simply because he can. Remarkable humor. This week watch one of the best laugh-fests ever conceived on film."
1.0,duck_soup,The Marx brothers are comedic legends and they are at their best in Duck Soup. Anyone who hasn't watched ...what are you wating for?

1.0,duck_soup,Truly one of the funniest movies you will ever see.
1.0,duck_soup,"Gentlemen, Chicolini here may talk like an idiot, and look like an idiot, but don't let that fool you: he really is an idiot."
1.0,duck_soup,One of the funniest movies ever made. There's not a moment that isn't comedy gold. Grocho Marx is king of the one liners.
1.0,duck_soup,"the marx brothers' top movie; no love story, all the songs are ridiculous, and the final montage is absurd perfection.""i was by my husband's side up until his final breath.""""no wonder he passed away."" - rufus t. firefly"

1.0,duck_soup,U MUST HAVE A QUICK WIT TO WATCH THESE MOVIES OF THE MARS BRO'S! THIS ONE IS A CULT CLASSIC FAVORITE OF WINSTON CHURCHILL AND VIETNAM PROTESTORS. MY FAVORITE OF ALL THEIR MOVIES!
1.0,duck_soup,One of the funniest Marx Bros. films. More jokes and more gags and much less singing...and when there is singing it's pretty funny too! Perhaps their finest.
1.0,duck_soup,This is the film that brings back the joy in life to Woody Allen's character in Hannah and Her Sisters. 'Nuff said?

1.0,duck_soup,"I love Duck Soup. I really think I would use the word ""love."""

1.0,duck_soup,"Non-stop laughs, its the Marx Brothers at their finest."
1.0,duck_soup,"Marx brothers at their most unbridled & brilliantly funny. I prefer ""Night at the Opera"" for it's classic comic structure, but this is truly their best work."
1.0,duck_soup,La tramoya de los sombreros le levanta el ánimo a cualquiera
1.0,duck_soup,This is such a funny movie. A real classic. Family Guy just spoofed the mirror scene on their last episode.
1.0,duck_soup,With the possible exception of Modern Times and City Lights this is the best comedy ever made. It's definitely the most anarchic and savagely hillarious talkie (although Dr. Strangelove comes close). The Three Stooges are the Marx Brothers without the brains or wit.
1.0,duck_soup,"""¿Sabe que no ha parado de hablar desde que llegó? ¿Qué ocurre? ¿La vacunaron con la aguja de un tocadiscos?"""
1.0,duck_soup,Maybe best COMIC (not comedy) movie ever.

1.0,duck_soup,"This movie was so entertaining, so now it's on my favorite movies list. I like the comedy, and the Marx Brothers, Harpo being my favorite <3 they just don't do comedies like this one anymore, and it just wouldn't work if they did either."
1.0,duck_soup,So hystarical with such a witty script. The Mark Brothers perfectly execute this witty and smart film. The undertone of war is quite political as well
1.0,duck_soup,Just about the funniest movie ever made.
1.0,duck_soup,Pure anarchy and genius.
1.0,duck_soup,"How to sum up a movie from 1933? History repeats it self, so make sure you see it. Perfect."

1.0,duck_soup,Quite Possibly My Favorite Comedy Of All Time. Marx Brothers Rule!!!

1.0,duck_soup,The funniest slap-stick comedy ever
1.0,duck_soup,This is my favorite movie!
1.0,duck_soup,The best Marx Brother movie ever!
1.0,duck_soup,"One of the greatest comedies of all time certainly doesn't fail to live up to its hype. Mixing a brand of quick wit with physical humor and a touch of music to it, the Marx brothers gives us a comedy-comedy where jokes go from start to finish."
1.0,duck_soup,Marx brothers are my LIFE!!
1.0,duck_soup,"the mirror scene is classic! general:war would mean a prohibited increase in our taxes chicolini:hey, i got an uncle who lives in taxes!! general:nooo. im talking about taxes, money, dollars. chicolini:dollars! that's where my uncle lives dollars, taxes!!!"
1.0,duck_soup,What can you say it's the Marx Brothers at their best.
1.0,duck_soup,One of their funniest!
1.0,duck_soup,"By far the best film the Marx Brothers ever made (only Horse Feathers and A Night At the Opera come close). Not just that, it's also a sure-fire candidate for the greatest comedy of all time. If you're a Marx Brothers novice, this is definitely the right film to begin with."
1.0,duck_soup,My favorite Marx Brothers' movie. It is also the first one of them I watched in my life. I guess that's why it is so special to me.
1.0,duck_soup,"The Marx Brothers at their anarchic best. ""All God's Chillun Got Guns""! This movie makes me howl from beginning to end."
1.0,duck_soup,"I know it's typical, but this really is my favorite marx brothers film. I thought it was hilarious when I was 8 and I've only found it even funnier as I've grown up."
1.0,duck_soup,i love the marx brothers.
1.0,duck_soup,I HEART the Marx Bros. so much. It is hard to believe that they made absolutely hilarious movies during the depression.
1.0,duck_soup,"OLD SCHOOL to the max. this movie is extremely funny for anyone silly whos REALLY willing to give old movies from completely different times a chance. and yes, despite the lack of harpo playing the harpo, it is the marx brothers best, and we can finally say goodbye to Zeppo after this one"
1.0,duck_soup,"My favorite Marx Brothers film. Where the world is familiar with the simple humor of The Three Stooges, it's a shame it can't be more familiar with the far more intelligent (and more funny) and often pointed humor of the Marx Brothers."
1.0,duck_soup,An indisputable comedy classic. Groucho's rapid fire dialogue perfectly compliments Harpo and Chico's physical brand of mayhem. This collection of antics simply cannot be ignored.
1.0,duck_soup,"death funny. slapstick, bad puns, visual gags. name it and its there."
1.0,duck_soup,"The best Marx Brothers movie of all time, which pretty much makes it the funniest movie ever."
1.0,duck_soup,"there's nothing i can add to what's been said about this movie. but i will go see it in any theater, any time and anywhere. and you probably should too. just realize if you want to go deeper that this is the only marx borthers movie without a harp or piano interlude."
1.0,duck_soup,Groucho... politics... comedy... genious!
1.0,duck_soup,"Inspired hilarity and nonsense every second. Marx Brothers movies obviously don't need a plot that makes any sense when they have ridiculously funny non-stop gags working for them. The Marx Brothers have influenced many comedy troupes today, most notably Stella."
1.0,duck_soup,The Marx Brothers at their finest.
1.0,duck_soup,Genius. Pure and simple. So good it is crispy fresh as the day it was made.
1.0,duck_soup,This is my favorite Marx Brothers movie. There's almost a laugh every second. It's one of the funniest comedies ever made.

1.0,duck_soup,A funny movie that still has relevance after all these years. It made me laugh when I'd amost forgotten how to.
1.0,duck_soup,"Duck Soup is the definative Marx Brothers film, incorporating many incredible jokes and comedy routines that are still used today (and yes, sometimes feel cliche) while still holding true the underlying political satire throughout the piece. A great film"
1.0,duck_soup,"Who doesn't love a political farce with the Marx Brothers?! This is such a classic, and it never loses it's relevance. That is what really amazes me."
1.0,duck_soup,"Remember what Anthony said about Raiders of the Lost Ark and Schindler's List? Well, whatever he said about this is also 100% correct."

1.0,duck_soup,Best Marx Bros. movie. Period.
1.0,duck_soup,"Absolutely amazing and one of the funniest movies EVER made! Every character was hilarious, the situations seem a little off context but that makes them funny. With political issues and parody of society itself, this makes the finest movie of 1933 and one of the greatest in the 30's!"
1.0,duck_soup,always...always makes me laugh
1.0,duck_soup,Classic comedy from the Marx Brothers. There are many set-pieces but the highlight has to be the scene where Groucho and Harpo are checking each other out in the mirror scene. Fantastic belly laughs all the way

1.0,duck_soup,WHAT?! You mean people with brains once wrote comedies?
1.0,duck_soup,"Probably the most brilliant political satire that was never *completely* meant to be a brilliant political satire. As Groucho once said when asked what the political message was in the film: ""Message? What message? We were just four Jews trying to get a laugh."" THAT is genius - just laugh."
1.0,duck_soup,They don't make them like this anymore..
1.0,duck_soup,"How on Earth to I begin to describe my utter love affair with the Marx Brothers? Can anyone name one film that not only propels a story, but also maintains a comedic zany magnitude of epic proportions like ""Duck Soup"" does? One of the best comedy films ever made!"
1.0,duck_soup,Made for multiple viewings. Something new everytime.
1.0,duck_soup,"The Marx Bros movies are the ideal comedies. They weren't sniffing coke, they weren't having sex all the time, and they weren't using the f word all the time. Today, all we have are raunchy comedies filled with sex jokes, drugs, and cursing."

1.0,duck_soup,"Notables from every country are gathered here in your honor. This is a gala day for you. Well, a gal a day is enough for me. I don't think I could handle any more. Three men and one woman are trapped in a building! Send help at once! If you can't send help, send two more women!"

1.0,duck_soup,"The greatest political satire to ever grace the screen (although no one knows exactly which form of politics they are satirizing, even themselves) from the greatest comedy team."
1.0,duck_soup,Quite possibly the best Marx Brothers film made. And in movie terms that makes it one of the greatest ways to spend a hour and eight minutes that can conceivably be devised. Awesome - from start to finish - they come no better than this.
1.0,duck_soup,"Easily the most entertaining of all Marx Bros. movies, and of all movies period, Duck Soup featured comedy routines that are now staples--and, in fact, requirements--of any comedy-lover's library. No comedian's training or history is complete without viewing this seminal classic."

1.0,the_gold_rush,"In my mind,the best Charlie Chaplin's movie!"
1.0,the_gold_rush,"Now I admit that the only version of The Gold Rush movie I have seen is the 1942 version which is Charlie Chaplin re-edited and did a voice over narration. Even Chaplain considered the 1942 version as superior to the original. But eventually I will watch the original version, just not right now."
1.0,the_gold_rush,"Some things about Chaplin and his ""Gold Rush"" are the ability to conceive nostalgia and to express human feelings without saying a word; things that, along with the well synchronized story tracking, turned this film into a transcendental classic."
1.0,the_gold_rush,"A thoroughly entertaining comedy, as well as a great exploration of what it means to ""strike it rich"". Not only is Chaplin timeless, he proves that he can be better with limitations than a lot of current directors are without them."

1.0,the_gold_rush,charlie chaplin. what else.
1.0,the_gold_rush,Fantastic and classic tale from Charlie Chaplin in his Little Tramp persona. One of the all time greats right here.
1.0,the_gold_rush,Chaplin nÃÂ£o poderia ser mais claro e eficiente sobre as mudanÃÂ§as e distorÃÂ§ÃÂµes em que a sociedade e as pessoas vivem: Come-se o sapato e se usam os pÃÂ£es como sapato.
1.0,the_gold_rush,Rediscovering Chaplin through these Criterion editions has reawakened the pure joy I had in 8th grade trying to find out everything about this great man. Such melancholy and happiness has never been melded like this. Perfection.
1.0,the_gold_rush,"The Gold Rush is a comedy with flashes of art, tragedy, love, interrelated with coarseness and rowdiness."
1.0,the_gold_rush,Classic Chaplin. 'Nuff said.

1.0,the_gold_rush,What a way to end the era of silent movie.Thank you Charlie.
1.0,the_gold_rush,"But the bottom line is that The Gold Rush is still funny after almost eighty years, and that's a feat few comedies in any year can ever accomplish. Chaplin, in his ability to extract maximum humor and poignancy from his material, has no equivalent today. What a shame."
1.0,the_gold_rush,Watched a Charlie Chaplin movie after a long time and loved it!
1.0,the_gold_rush,"I liked the movie.. He made me laugh from my heart.. about Georgia, his love, she's a slut"
1.0,the_gold_rush,A comedy that might make you tear up.

1.0,the_gold_rush,"Why was I surprised that this was anything less than brilliant? This movie doesn't need color, CGI special effects, 3D, or yes, talking. It has quite possibly the greatest tragi-comic actor of all time. And here he is in all his genius. Amazing!!"
1.0,the_gold_rush,I'm a big Charlie Chaplin fan and this one of my favorite CC movies.
1.0,the_gold_rush,what a genius of comedy so early in the history of film. laugh out loud funny and also quite tender; viva la tramp.
1.0,the_gold_rush,"Great actors, great writing, great story, great filming, great score  Chaplin is phenomenal. I loved this movie. For a silent film it was great I enjoyed it very much. Fun to watch."
1.0,the_gold_rush,so many classic moments
1.0,the_gold_rush,"The best of Chaplin's ""little tramp"" films in my estimation, this film is equal parts humor, emotion and slapstick. I think one of my favorite moments is his ""dance of the dinner rolls"", simply classic. If you're going to sit down to just one chaplin film, make it this one."
1.0,the_gold_rush,"After all these years, this is the first complete CC movie I've seen!! Epic! good humor made real!"
1.0,the_gold_rush,"Another hilarious Chaplin classic. Full of joy and laughter watchng this film with lots of very rememberable scenes like the eating of his shoe, the cabin on the edge of the mountain and the roll dance. Simple story with so much to add for the film."

1.0,the_gold_rush,"It's unique. The comedy and the reality about the history walk together in a brilliant narrative. After City Lights, my favorite Chaplin's film."

1.0,the_gold_rush,one of the funniest and the greatest film of all time...
1.0,the_gold_rush,"Unquestionably one of the greatest movies of all time, it is a classic masterpiece. Charlie Chaplin is brilliant, both his direction and his acting. Tremendously funny, touching and sweet. It's a rare filmmaker that can combine slapstick humor with heart wrenching scenes. Absolutely wonderful."
1.0,the_gold_rush,"Chaplin is a genius in his 1925 movie, in which he starred in, directed, produced, and composed music for. ""The Gold Rush"" is a heartwarming silent film, that will reel in new fans for Chaplin every time. This lovable story proves that good guys don't finish last, and love conquers all."
1.0,the_gold_rush,All I can say is... if you haven't seen it... SEE IT!!!!
1.0,the_gold_rush,"Simply extraordinary and very, very funny. One of Chaplin's finest films. Features the classic bread roll dance & shoe eating sequences.For anyone looking for genuine originality in this era of remakes & re-imaginings, this is a good place to start."
1.0,the_gold_rush,Chaplin at his best!
1.0,the_gold_rush,"Clasico de la comedia y de la filmografia de Chaplin que incluye el inmortal (y doloroso) sketch del zapato, la transformacion de Chaplin en pollo y el baile de los panecillos. Obligatoria para cualquier fanatico del cine."
1.0,the_gold_rush,Uma comédia com poucos adversários na história do cinema.
1.0,the_gold_rush,Worth five stars for the roll dance scene alone. Perhaps not the best Tramp-movie but it still rates at the top. The narration underlines how unnecessary it really is -- one understands almost everything without it. Now that's communication!
1.0,the_gold_rush,"I unwittingly rented the 1943 version which was great. I think the silent one is probably better, but you can't really ruin this classic. An amazing film that generations of comedians and films have tried to replicate."

1.0,the_gold_rush,Of all the films Charlie Chaplin made this is considered his masterpiece.

1.0,the_gold_rush,"For those who believe all Chaplin did was those little 5 minute shorts before the main feature when we were kids, you'll see this movie is full of pathos and poignancy that makes you realise his greatness. He was one of the true geniuses of the 20th century."
1.0,the_gold_rush,"Very enjoyable, smart plot, funny and brilliant!"
1.0,the_gold_rush,"Chaplin cpatures our hearts by putting the tramp up against the dangers of nature itself, and the pains of love."

1.0,the_gold_rush,Chaplin makes me laugh out loud! I love him.
1.0,the_gold_rush,"Although I didn't enjoy it as much as some of his shorts (particularly Easy Street), It's still a great film, and just a small part of Chaplin's revolution of the cinema."
1.0,the_gold_rush,"Gee, i almost die laughing"
1.0,the_gold_rush,Chaplin did more without sound than the majority of directors around today do with sound.
1.0,the_gold_rush,"Saw the 1942 re-release with the added narration. The addition seems to work surprisingly well. Charley Chaplin's amazing performace style still holds up and entertains. A true auteur: writing, directing, starring in, and scoring this classic."

1.0,the_gold_rush,"One of my favorites when I was a little kid, and I still love it! Charlie Chaplin was brilliant and this movie is a good example of him doing what he did best. A comedy with some loneliness thrown in and some of the Tramp's most classic moments. Everyone should see this movie :)"

1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,Lightly soapy dramedy gets obliterated by the quintessential Bette Davis no-nonsense role that cemented her superstardom. Stunning & Hilarious - sit back and watch.. It's going to be a bumpy ride.. Hahahahaha
1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,"A young fan finally meets her broadway idol & quickly sweeps into her life & straightens up the messes, but maybe she's not as perfect as she appears. A fantastic film about our star-obsessed culture & the cutthroat ways to get ahead."

1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,Close to perfect. Davis is at her vitriolic best and Baxter is vindictive and scheming. Also the small parts played by Ritter and Monroe were wonderful. The change from adorable to despicable of Eve is handled so well that you hang on every scene. Perhaps the best script ever written.

1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,this Best Picture winner is perhaps the greatest film about showbiz. Bette Davis gives her best performance here and Celeste Holm and Thelma Ritter are also fascinating here. The witty script strikes the audience at any viewing and it is shot well and directed distinctly

1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,"Bette Davis is maybe the best reason for anyone to watch it, as well as the the excellent work by Manciewicz (co-writter of the script for Welles's ""Citizen Kane"")."

1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,"Burning with cynicism, rage and multiple layers. Massive standout performance from Bette. Revolutionary use of multiple perspectives to construct a tale. A great accompaniment to Sleuth, although much better actedPossibly the best film about acting ever realised"
1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,Loved loved LOVED this movie. A lot. Everything from the story to the acting was fantastic. It's a hard core look at what stardom and the drive to be famous can do to a person.
1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,The bitchiest film ever made. An outstanding script with dynamite performances. It's a brutal attack on Hollywood and the fanaticism with celebrities.

1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,"A gripping thriller made by fantastic acting, superb script, an intense story that stands up and delivers more emotionally and is harder hitting than other thrillers with violent bloodshed. There's too much to praise here."
1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,Fantastic movie! Loved every minute of it.
1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,"very weel acted and directed. plus, note how MM just steal the whole screen as she enters the scene."

1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,"Finally, a film with a female heroine and a female villain, and it's not a chick flick! Witty and smart dialogue with such devilish plot twists. I don't know anyone who can resist the charm of Bette Davis. ""Fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy night!"""

1.0,monty_pythons_life_of_brian,"Easily the best film out of the Monty Python troupe's arsenal, it's hilarity and dry wit is memorable, original and iconic of British humour.

1.0,playtime,Playtime is a masterpiece of slapstick that finds the joy and the scorn in how high-tech and detached the world has become.
1.0,playtime,"A remarkable Jacque Tati classic. It's a delightful, inventive, charming, imaginative, light-hearted comedy that both satirizes and celebrates the modern world of technology."
0.0,playtime,"vicually captivating, Masterful use of various sounds and merticulous attention to the sounds, but overall I just didn't enjoy it.The plot seems to miss the point, and it felt like a a bunch of artistically interesting sounds bits and visual images, but nothing more."
1.0,playtime,"The combination of superb production design, amazing color schemes and the magics of 70mm depth of field make this film my favorite of all times. This is more than a movie, this is a deep dig into a world."
1.0,playtime,"A masterpiece!!! I couldn't stop laughing, which doesn't often happen. Jacques Tati is a genius and this movie is his best."
0.0,playtime,Whatever was funny about this in the 60's escapes me. This is one of the most dull movies I've seen. Does not withstand the test of time at all (and I'm from the 1960's)!
0.0,playtime,Total pseudo-intellectual arthouse garbage. This movie is so pretentious I wanted to kill myself three different times throughout.
1.0,playtime,Tati oozes originality.
1.0,playtime,For me this film should be seen on one's tv it needs a bigger screen than a laptop or even a desk top PC to revel it's beauty.
1.0,playtime,"Not a story, but a tremendous cinematic universe, that never stops to amaze with its detail and brilliance. An unbelievable film. Might be the greatest cinematic achievement of all time."
1.0,playtime,"An inspired, spirited farce of humanity breaking through the lifeless edifice of rigid modernity."
1.0,playtime,"Still in my top 3 movies of all time. Simple and silly, yet sublime and strong. A great riposte of Paris modernity that is still as relevant today for the whole modern world."
1.0,playtime,A delightful physical comedy which is wonderfully choreographed.
1.0,playtime,"One of the greatest films ever. Extremely fun, hilarious, inventive and continually perfect. My personal favorite of the M. Hulot films. It is absolutely gorgeous and brilliantly shot."
1.0,playtime,"Jaques Tati's masterpiece, and one of my personal favorite films. Its long, static shots and nearly simultaneous sight gags distinguish it as a classic piece of French cinema"
1.0,playtime,"Like peeking through a portal to a strange anachronistic land with its own customs and behaviors, Tati's highly amusing, nearly wordless masterpiece is more a film to be experienced than simply watched. Beautiful 70mm cinematography, incredible sound design. There is no other film quite like it."
1.0,playtime,Absolutely Love this movie!

1.0,playtime,"perfect vision of how things are today, totally unique"
1.0,playtime,What a fantastic movie! It reminds me of a painting that's always changing and moving. The remastered Criterion version looks greaton blu-ray. Check this movie out.
1.0,playtime,Visuele humor ten top! Deze film is puur genieten! Bovendien is deze film tegelijkertijd een commentaar op als een ode aan het modernisme. Faut le faire.Zo'n klassieker verdient dan ook 5 sterren!
1.0,playtime,"If Buster Keaton were Luis Bunuel he'd be Jacques Tati. An incredible achievement of humorous ballet form and comic mise en scÃ¨ne with themes reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin's ""Modern Times."" Not as obviously funny and breezy as ""Mr. Hulot's Holiday"" but perhaps even more brilliant."
1.0,playtime,Incredible chaos of absolute order!
1.0,playtime,One of the greatest (and most original) films ever made. Brilliant mise-en-scene ensures you can never tire of watching it. There is always something else to notice. It looks especially beautiful on bluray.

1.0,playtime,Probably the best comedy i've ever seen that has almost no plot whatso
0.0,playtime,"This Mr. Magoo crap is pissing me off! Why do people care about this rube and his adventures in France? They made 3 of these? I have seen all 3 and they are pretty pointless, unless the point is that the French have the worst sense of humor on the planet."
1.0,playtime,"MisstÃ¤nker att Blake Edwards inspirerades av TatiÂ´s ""Playtime"" nÃ¤r han och Peter Sellers gjorde filmen ""The Party"" 1968."
1.0,playtime,"Now that I've seen it on blu-ray projected on my wall, I'm determined that this is one of the greatest achievements in film ever. Tati has made a film like no other before or since. You have to see this movie."
1.0,playtime,"A masterpiece of controlled chaos, comedy, and choreography. No filmmaker alive today has displayed anything near the visual brilliance conveyed here in every frame. That makes this a very special film, and makes today's cinematic climate kind of disappointing."
1.0,playtime,This is an absolute masterpiece.
1.0,playtime,This movie is unexplainable. You just have to see it. Trust me. A carefully orchestrated ensemble and visually stimulating movie. You'll get something different out of it with each viewing.
1.0,playtime,Best movie about modernism in culture and society!
1.0,playtime,"The best of Tati's Monsieur Hulot films and probably his best overall. As always, the Chaplin influences are there...particularly ""Modern Times"" for this one. You won't find a funnier predominately-slapstick film from the last 50 years."
1.0,playtime,Mind-boggling masterpiece
1.0,playtime,"What a joy. A visual dream, funny, mesmerizing and as its named, Playtime for adults. It felt like a brilliant short documentary, thats how enjoyable it is, as it is really 126 minutes long. It is superb, see it if you can."
1.0,playtime,"The most ""silent"" and sonically rich movie I have ever seen. ""Silent"" as in the narrative, there ain't much to ""say"" but we hear a lot! We hear bunches of sonic information...... Tati is amazing!"
1.0,playtime,"An outrageous, absurdist, intelligent comedy the style of which is totally unique. This is a movie that demands your attention, and rewards you richly for it."
1.0,playtime,It's like a french elevator music musical. Only imagine the music being pushed right to the background and the people populating the widescreen images making constant references to the perils of modernism. What a beautiful movie!
1.0,playtime,"An truly mesmerizing kind of cinema; one that most people, myself included, are surprised by at first. But that's why I love it. One of my lifetime dreams is to see this on 70mm."
1.0,playtime,A Glassic Masterpiece
1.0,playtime,"A perfectly choreographed, nearly balletic comedy. When you're not laughing, you're admiring. And you're often both."

1.0,playtime,"Amazing, stylized, and original task of film making."
1.0,playtime,"An amazing film. There's almost no dialog, and very little in the way of a plot, but it doesn't matter. It's very funny and sweet. I want to live in Hulot's world."
1.0,playtime,"unspeakably beautiful. flaws, yes. but the kind of that live on with you as you try to repair them in your head"
1.0,playtime,"My favourite Tati's. An aesthete film, where picture tells much more than dialogs (hardly existing here)."
1.0,playtime,"One of the most unmarketable large format films out there. (Save Stan Brakhage's IMAX attempt, of course.)"
1.0,playtime,"A wholly unique and absorbing cinematic experience. Beautiful 70mm widescreen compositions featuring unbelievably detailed sets and precisely choreographed movement plunge the viewer into Tati's sleek, ultra-modern (but amusing) world."
1.0,playtime,see this as soon as possible. and over and over again. you'll be doing yourself a favor.
1.0,playtime,"My personal favorite of the Hulot films. Wicked humor and satire abound in this ""modernized"" Paris. How this film ever flopped is beyond me."
1.0,playtime,People act like this guy is pretentious. That's like saying that it's pretentious to watch kids play. People guard mediocrity pretty closely. It's the best foundation for consumerism.
1.0,playtime,After having a chance of seeing it again reminded me why this film is so highly regarded
1.0,playtime,"Few minds in cinema operate as strangely and playfully in a perfectionist manner. If you're a hardcore film-buff, it's a must."
1.0,playtime,Almost inconceivably brilliant.
1.0,playtime,"probably the greatest film of all time. if i had seen this in 1967, i wouldve expected the future of cinema to look like this. seeing it on the big screen is like watching a performance."
1.0,playtime,"Inside these frames the viewer has no predesigned guide of what we must see, while we get completely shallowed by the fascinating-mind-dumbing architecture of modern life. A masterpiece."
1.0,playtime,The best Jacques Tati's film! This is my favourite film all the time.
1.0,playtime,"""Playtime"" is one of the most interesting things ever to happen in the history of film.Watch it, read about it, watch the documentary, watch the film again."
1.0,playtime,What the fuck is this shit? Some guy in a trenchcoat wanders around for two hours looking for a bathroom -- by the time this was over I understood his dilemma.
1.0,playtime,"Playtime has no real plot and unless you totally engage yourself with the mise-en-scene you will hate. Yet, throughout the duration of this film, I couldn't stop smiling. I swear I didn't want it to end! The humor is subtle, clever and heartwarming."
1.0,playtime,"This isn't laugh-out-loud funny, this is more of a consistent-smile-on-your-face type of humour. But there are also poignant moments - the lost images of Paris reflected in glass, for example - that make this film so much more than a comedy."
1.0,playtime,what a pity this was the movie that ruined tall jacques' carrier.shame on the bloody cowards in the studios!
1.0,playtime,Tati's satire on the modernization of our culture is a terrific achievement in film-making. Funny and delightful. You haven't seen the beauty of cinema until you watch Playtime.

1.0,playtime,A lighter type of approach to the things that wings of desire is after...

1.0,playtime,"Tripping, the new print includes long scenes in the restaurant that are brilliant but it needs an intermission,preferably with tea in the lobby bollywood-style."

1.0,playtime,"Watch it on a big screen if you have the chance. There is so much going on in the picture. Now I sound like my dad, but I don't care. That's what Tati is all about."
1.0,playtime,A critique of hypermodern monoculture that is scathing while it is hilarious. Beautifully rendered and hypnotic. Also of note for its role in inspiring contemporary photographers such as Martha Rosler who employ similar tactics in looking at the effects of the corporatization of public space.

1.0,playtime,"Tati's brilliant masterpiece. A must see. The coldness, grayness and boxiness of modern life verses the warmth of la vraie France. So much of the scenery looks à jour!"

1.0,playtime,Totally astounding. Nothing like this had ever been made before (not even by Tati himself) and nothing like this will ever be made again. I would kill to see this on a big screen in the original 70mm. My favorite film.
1.0,playtime,"Ein av dei beste, mest for seg gjorte komedier som er laga. Ein hysterisk satire over modernismen."
1.0,playtime,Perhaps the most brilliant comedy ever put on film. I only wish I could see this on the big screen. It takes a few viewings to appreciate entirely.
1.0,playtime,Supermodernization of the modern world...Auge and the nonplace. Beautiful comedy.
1.0,playtime,"A Tati film is a visual workout, as each shot is loaded with subtle comedy forcing your eyes to wander the frame in search of silliness. An enjoyable comment on modern living and its effect on the Old World."
1.0,playtime,Comedy meets art - this film bears repeated viewings because there is always something to seen afresh - another Tati gem.
1.0,playtime,"Once again, Jacques Tati's character M. Hulot causes madness and mayhem in his attempts to understand modernity."
1.0,playtime,"Awesome comedy about the little things in life, the crazed future and the unavoidable nonsense of technology. There's no way you can just watch this... you have to lean forward, and pick out the details. For a movie so old, it still speaks to us. Also, the sight gags are hilarious."
1.0,playtime,"delicious, hilarious and surreal film about modernity and its nonsenses. Very stylish and so full of details that is one to be seen again"
1.0,playtime,"One of the few truly unique films that I've seen. It's also one of the funniest. In a way it's ""physical"" comedy. But it extends beyond that. Each movement and interaction makes a statement on man and his relationship to the post-modern Habitrail that he populates."

1.0,playtime,"So epic, yet hardly any plot. Hilarious and beautiful, really an amazing film."

1.0,playtime,"Tati's use of 70mm has to be seen on a big screen to be believed. Some of the best blocking ever imagined, and a movie that interrogates the absurdity of modern industrial Parisian life (Similar to Godard at the same time) only with out being heavy handed."
1.0,playtime,Favorite Movie. I need to find a way to see in in 70mm.
1.0,playtime,Never before has architecture been so funny.

1.0,playtime,Fantastic and fun movie!
0.0,playtime,maybe a bit to ... old? artistic? dunno

0.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,similar to an acid trip that's overwhelmingly uninteresting and something you'd never want to have to sit through/experience again.
0.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,"Everyone said I would love this. Everyone was wrong. Now, I love the Beatles and all, but really?! Seriously? Yeah, dude, let's drop acid and watch Yellow Submarine. It's so trippy. Anyone who thinks that needs to get a life."

0.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,"A psychedelic waste pit of ugly UA animation, a song the only makes sense if you are on LSD, an bad acting."
1.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,"It's visuals may not be of the comprehension of some viewers (inluding me) but that can't remove the fact that Yellow Submarine is more than a musical, it's an authentic piece of art. Even many years after it's release, it has the same magic."
1.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,Endlessly inventive animation invigorates this tale of the Beatles saving a psychadelic fantasy land from a nasty horde of invaders. The images stagger the imagination and overall the film serves as the perfect complement to the Fab Four's late 60's material.
1.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,My favorite movie ever!

1.0,the_edge_of_seventeen,The best teen high school film since The Breakfast Club. Hailee Steinfeld deserves an Oscar nomination for her brilliant performance
1.0,the_edge_of_seventeen,So good it was based on this girls life and it was a pretty sad life.
1.0,the_edge_of_seventeen,They seriously don't make movies like this anymore. This truly is like the perfect combination of Sixteen Candles and the Breakfast Club and has a deeper storyline than most coming of age movies that are being produced. Easily one of my favorite movies!

1.0,1001115-apartment,"Really I would rate this beyond 5. It's a movie that has stuck with me though most of my life. Oddly, I didn't think of adding it here until I just saw the characters in a French movie refer to it"

1.0,1001115-apartment,EXCEPTIONNEL !Merci Dimitri.
1.0,1001115-apartment,"I finally saw this, and was impressed with how it kills every other romantic comedy that has ever been made. I mean, rom-coms are generally pretty crappy-that's a given. Not so with this one. Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine are great."
1.0,1001115-apartment,"Hurrah for Fran, Baxter, Sheldrake, Dreyfuss and Dobisch. Billy Wilder had a knack for smart and subtle studio era comedy like no other. In an era bound by formula, the Oscars deservedly swept this classic up and lauded it for everything it deserved. A must see for everyone."

1.0,1001115-apartment,"One of the very best of the ""best picture"" winners."
1.0,1001115-apartment,"They really don't make movies like this anymore. Jack Lemmon is brilliant, Shirley MacLaine is sublime, and Fred MacMurray is truly frightening as the villain, especially for those who know him best as the good father on ""My Three Sons."" A Billy Wilder classic."

1.0,1001115-apartment,"A romantic comedy masterpiece, featuring a cast from heaven. Wilder doesn't shy away from the darkness, layering whimsical, romantic material with adult themes, but never losing the deft comic appeal of the central love story. One of the greatest endings ever, too."
1.0,1001115-apartment,Both funny and sad at the same time. One of my favorite romantic movies. It amazes me how far ahead of its time this movie was when it came out.
1.0,1001115-apartment,"One of my favorite films. The kind of film you just want ""live in,"" odd for a film that's so claustrophobic too. This will make you want to see everything Jack Lemmon's ever done. Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond's screenplay doesn't have many equals."

1.0,repo_man,My favorite movie ever.
1.0,repo_man,"One could say this movie is many genres and things jumbled up into one. Whatever it is, it definitely isn't boring. This movie is one of the most random, cooky, and outlandish out there. But it's great. It covers a lot of important themes."
1.0,repo_man,"Characters that jump off of the screen. A plot so far fetched that even the most serious of watchers will crack a smile. Off the wall, exciting, and with killer tunes to boot. You'll be eager to grab a white and blue beverage after the show. A cult classic!"

0.0,repo_man,I'll just say outright that I don't get this film. It has a somewhat decent scifi premise but only a few scenes expand on this. Mostly this is just bad comedy bits and other bits of nonsense strung together. I was not a fan.
0.0,repo_man,11/26/2015: Not a good movie. The acting and story were both pretty bad. I don't understand the high scores.
1.0,repo_man,"Alex Cox was mildly Godardian. This and the Sid Vicious biopic, Sid & Nancy, were really quite wonderful and then nothing. Repo Man was insanely watchable, though, and once you've seen it it's nothing you'll ever forget."

0.0,repo_man,Whoever came up with this storyline had no imagination.
1.0,repo_man,Quirky film about an aloof punk-rocker who accidentally becomes an auto reposseser. They actually manage to fit in a whole subplot about aliens somewhere in the mix. many memorable lines and moments of intentional camp make this a bizzare classic.
1.0,repo_man,It all about the junk in your trunk

1.0,repo_man,"Otto is a suburban L.A. punk who accepts a job as a repo man and finds himself embroiled in a wild plot involving a '64 Chevy Malibu, the CIA, and a dead Alien. This movie has a vicious sense of humor aimed straight at the jugular of the Reagan era. The greatest punk soundtrack ever compiled."
1.0,repo_man,"My favorite cult classic ever! It's a cool film, with only one boring scene. It's plot is all twisted around from stealing cars, to deadly alien inventions. It's jokes are also hilarious. Overall, I recommend this to anyone."
1.0,repo_man,Excellent cult film!
1.0,repo_man,Repo Man probably does not compute for many folks...it is a surreal story about Southern California in the 1980's so may have too much subcultural specificity....Also you need to like Punk Rock...
1.0,repo_man,Funky 80's classiic with a confused yet extremely sexy Emilio Estevez

1.0,monsieur_lazhar_2011,"Brilliant! Monsieur Lazhar has been nominated as the best foreign language film. All languages are foreign, otherwise the word languages would not exist."
1.0,monsieur_lazhar_2011,It teaches us not to sugar-coat losses or create melodramatic contents spuriously. The solid intelligence and emotion is what makes this somber and excellent film. One would always wish to have teachers like these people.

1.0,monsieur_lazhar_2011,"I loved this film. It was surprisingly funny and sweet, and of course sad, due to the subject matter.

1.0,monsieur_lazhar_2011,"An intricately woven story told in a caring, gentle way. The story line offers many opportunities to go off on sentimental tangents. However, they are all carefully avoided and what remains is a truly moving, very delicate and realistic account. Excellent!"

0.0,love_and_friendship,"Seemed like utter twaddle, can't remember looking at my watch so often in any other film. Central character well acted by Iate Backinsdale but completely unlikeable."
1.0,love_and_friendship,"Love, love, loved it"
0.0,love_and_friendship,"I had to walk out of this oh-so-self-aware film because there was not one character to identify with, to love, to care about. The book is lovely. Whit Stillman - boo!"

0.0,love_and_friendship,"The comedy seemed forced, almost like it was aspiring to be better and more classic than Pride and Prejudice while simultaneously being mean girls."
1.0,love_and_friendship,"Excellent period movie. You are cast into a different world and time long before hoards of cell phone screen staring zombies, back where people of wealth and position rode horses and carriages."
0.0,love_and_friendship,A Jane Austen movie without the redeeming qualities we've come to expect. A waste of 90 minutes and $21.75.
0.0,love_and_friendship,"Except for Kate, this was the worst acted movie I have ever seen. Rivals Barbarella for that honor. The dialog was poorly written and even the delivery would offend a recent acting school dropout. I realize this movie is getting rave reviews, which is a complete mystery to me."
0.0,love_and_friendship,Surprised by these comments. I left a third of the way through. Either under or overacted and boring

0.0,love_and_friendship,Be prepared to sleep....terrible. Not funny at all!
0.0,love_and_friendship,"I have thoroughly enjoyed many other Jane Austen works, but this was slow moving and not very engaging. There was no heroine to see grow in wisdom. Instead it was basically the amusements of a deceptive adulterer and her wily ways."
0.0,love_and_friendship,Worst movie ever! Three out of the five people were with fell asleep. Don't waist your $$ watching this movie. Even when it leaves the theaters. How it is getting 99% in rating tells me it's all fixed.
0.0,love_and_friendship,Worthless drrivel.. Period costumes and set only redeeming interest.
1.0,love_and_friendship,"Love and Friendship combines three of my favorite things: Jane Austen's genius and wit, wonderful Baroque (mostly) music, and great lighting in cinematography.

1.0,8-12,"It's a seminal work of interwoven dreams that is so seamlessly put together the audience often has trouble deciding what is relatity, and what is not. For most movies, this would prove disastrous. But for 8 1/2, it's a factor that is critical in the film's success."

1.0,8-12,"This is simply genius film making - thematically and artistically. Just when I want to critique it on something, it addresses my critique with sharp self-awareness.

1.0,8-12,The best italian movie. The best Fellini's dream.
1.0,8-12,"The thing I loved about this film when I first watched it was that almost everything in 8 1/2 contradicts the traditional seamless story line of the conventional Hollywood film. For film makers, this is the film to watch."

1.0,8-12,"Asa nisi masa, so save time. Three different languages?"
1.0,8-12,"we are smothered by words, images and sounds that have no right to exist, that come from the void and return to the void. Of any artist truly deserving of the name we should ask nothing but this act of faith: to learn silence."

1.0,8-12,back to brilliant classics....
1.0,8-12,Can't believe it took me so long to see something by Fellini. What a trip this movie is.

1.0,8-12,One of the all-time greats. Grows richer with repeated viewing.
1.0,8-12,"Quaint, nostalgic, and fantastical. The picture of an original man-child. A great counterpart to Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries. Also check out Woody Allen's tribute to Bergman and Fellini in Stardust Memories."

1.0,8-12,An strike of the ages.
1.0,8-12,"Cinema's most insane and crazy director while still being one of the most literate makes his true masterpiece with 8 1/2. This films is beautiful, horrifying, hilarious, insane, saddening, and memorizing, usually all at the same time. A filmmakers kind of film."

1.0,8-12,The best italian film in 60's
1.0,8-12,"A movie that ventures into the deepest and darkest sentiments of a filmmaker in a humourous way. With felliniesque visuals, disconnected scenes and superfluous symbolism, the whole is even more magical than the sum of its parts in a square root. It comes to an 8 1/2."
1.0,8-12,"Not my favorite, but probably the best movie about filmmaking ever made."

1.0,8-12,I wish there were 6 star options... cause this movie would get it. Perfect in everyway.
1.0,8-12,A staggering psychological exploration of creative discord and the very fabric of genius. Awe-inspiring art. Bellissimo. 10/10

1.0,8-12,"A unique Fellini picture with a stunning cast about a confused, frustrated artist. Incredibly personal and realistic, this is Italian cinema at its best."
1.0,8-12,Amazing movie. Was great even with all the wonderful things I'd heard about it. I was not disappointed.
1.0,8-12,Fellini speaks the language of intellectual cinema and whether we really need the system of it when we ourselves are hypocritical in all senses of life.
1.0,8-12,Fellini's masterpiece
1.0,8-12,I'm going to need to give it a second viewing. There's so much going on in this movie. Loved it though.
1.0,8-12,Love movies about movies when they're this well done.
1.0,8-12,"Self-Indulgent, sexist, adolescent and gloriously cinematic. The more I see it the more I love it."
1.0,8-12,"Fellini's a genius. One of the more original, brilliantly made films ever."
1.0,8-12,todos deberÃ­an tener la oportunidad de ver esta pelÃ­cula
1.0,8-12,"A cinematic masterpiece. Fellini is a genius, for making such a legendary movie about a guy who can't make a movie. This is an instant favorite."
1.0,8-12,Wow... wow... wow...O_O
1.0,8-12,"I can tell that this is a movie that is going to get richer with every repeat viewing. Capturing the anxieties of the filmmaking process, Fellini has made one of the most bizarre and interesting stories about the creation of art."
1.0,8-12,The harem scene is a beautiful film classic!
1.0,8-12,My little 2 cents wont make much of a differece how briliant this film is.
1.0,8-12,"The perfect film. Full of beautiful women, sharp lighting, gorgeous shots and fragile humanity."
1.0,8-12,"Completely engrossing and beautiful story. Great script. Acting is very well done.Fellini sure knew how to pick his women.Awesome movie, watch!!"
1.0,8-12,The greatest work of art about the pressures of the artist regarding works of art
1.0,8-12,"I don't really like Fellini, but this, and La Strada, surprised me; 100% engrossing and brilliantly realized."
1.0,8-12,its absurdity was spectacular!
1.0,8-12,Larger-than-life ideas spawn what many consider is one of the best movies ever made. This inspired many other great movies. May be the king of all Italian movies.
1.0,8-12,"A *MUST* see, but late at night, with no phone calls. Put the kids to sleep and just chill.Probably the most striking, poetic film of all time! An inspiration for filmmakers and cinema for all time."
1.0,8-12,"Just wow. I was expecting one of the most overrated movies ever, but it is not. It deserves all the praise it has gotten. The performances, script, direction, all amazing. It might just be my favorite movie of all time."
1.0,8-12,Poetry in motion. Sublime.
1.0,8-12,"One of my all-time favorite films, and probably my favorite Fellini film. A movie with wonderful surreal imagery, thought-provoking existential and non-linear plotline, and a fantastic score by Nino Rota. One of the greatest films ever made."
1.0,8-12,"Reality, dreams and fantasy are never explained as if it were explicit in the experience. This is in the best 5 movies ever made and perhaps the most beautiful B&W; movie ever."
1.0,8-12,"Una pelicula sobre una pelicula o sobre la vida misma. Las mujeres jamas entenderan cual es la esencia de esta pelicula que brota testosterona por todas partes, acerca del bloqueo masculino, la frustracion masculina y la ensonacion masculina en todos los sentidos posibles de estos conceptos."
1.0,8-12,What a masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,8-12,"In Fellini's own words, ""Beautifully confused""."
1.0,8-12,It was maybe the most important movie for me in studying moviescience! I remember the lecture on italian film and the sequences from otto e mezzo. It was something special I had never seen before ... So I did my thesis about Fellini ...
1.0,8-12,Such a beautiful film. A perfect entrance to Fellini's extraordinary career.
1.0,8-12,"Very well directed, great cinematography, and Guido is a great character; he's very sympathetic, well acted, and has the coolest glasses and sunglasses around"
1.0,8-12,"A masterpiece in ways I can't describe, but must see again soon in order to elaborate upon."
1.0,8-12,"Intense, mind-engaging and deeply personal depiction of what it takes to be a filmmaker. I watch this film every time I have problems with creativity."
1.0,8-12,Another Top Ten Favourite for me. Marcello Mastroianni was the Italian character actor with all the flawless charisma and technique of Cary Grant. Fellini is genius- period. And this film is the smoothest of Fellini's surreal landscapes with the most emotional bumps.
1.0,8-12,If you have not seen this then you do not know film.I've seen it on my birthday and it just shattered everything i thought i knew about filmmaking or storytelling. Its a masterpiece
1.0,8-12,The rare occurrence when a film lives up to the years of expectation heaped upon its shoulders is something to remember. What can I add that has not already been said about this film? It is magnificent. It also features the most beautiful cast of women I have ever seen.
1.0,8-12,One of the best films ever made. As profound an experience there is to be had in cinema.
1.0,8-12,Visionary film and director; some of cinema's greatest dream sequences.
1.0,8-12,"God knows, how many times I watched this film...like many, many times...lost count..."
1.0,8-12,Awesome writing. The pinnacle of avant-garde filmmaking.
1.0,8-12,"The greatest fantasy in the history of film. It's also a vey mystical film because it speaks directly to my sub-conscious. And also, one can just relax and wallow in the fun of it."
1.0,8-12,"trippiest movie ever made? perhaps not, but for the mainstream viewer, yes, yes it is."
1.0,8-12,One of greatest movies I have ever seen!
1.0,8-12,Way back when...upon watching the first five minutes I finally realized someone else saw life the same way I did. Took my breath away.
1.0,8-12,Another flawless classic from Fellini. A lot of the deeper allegories were lost on me but the film is genuinely fun to watch and skillfully paced.
1.0,8-12,"This is the best film I've ever seen in my whole life. From the beginning until the very last second, it has ""brilliant"" written all over it.The film itself is beautiful. The pacing is also perfect."
1.0,8-12,Truly the greatest achievement in cinematic history!
1.0,8-12,non e' al primo posto solo perche' sono romagnolo...
1.0,8-12,"MUCH MUCH MUCH better than La Dolce Vita! I can now say that Fellini really is a fantastic, brilliant storyteller!"
1.0,8-12,Has to be my favorite of all time. No question. Stunning and poignant. Just everything a film should be.
1.0,8-12,Maybe the greatest movie of all time...
1.0,8-12,So tasty tasty tasty movie....
1.0,8-12,Like Shakespeare...watch it twice to get it once.
1.0,8-12,A foreign film for people who don't like foreign films. Art doesn't get any better or more breathtaking than this.
1.0,8-12,How can you go wrong with a protagonist named Guido?
1.0,8-12,"Not for everyone. First time I saw it I didn't understand it, but the film looked beautiful. But after rewatching it and take the time to really absorb it, you'll be rewarded for its endless creativity and thoughtful examination of humanity."
1.0,8-12,Fellini balances playful and dramatic storytelling without one compromising the other. Throw in Mastroianni and Cardinale and you got one beautiful film.
1.0,8-12,One of the moust inspirational movies I have ever seen.
1.0,8-12,"The most brilliant autobiographical work in film. Reflective, poetic, a showcase of Fellini's art and wizardry. Mastroianni is perfect in alter-ego performance."
1.0,8-12,Lives up to its reputation
1.0,8-12,**Fellini s masterpiece** the man who cant love...
1.0,8-12,Brilliant and crazy film about a director trying to reconcile his life. Images really jump out at you in this one.
1.0,8-12,Fellini... sei sempre il megliore
1.0,8-12,Outstanding film. Really hypnotic & fascinating.
1.0,8-12,"the greatest italian film? It is quite possible. The story itself is nothing great but it is the depth of each of the characters, along with some of cinema's most memorable shots that make this truly great."
1.0,8-12,"This film is highly poetic in its presentation, emitting the same degree of intensity as any of James Joyce's best writings. A must-watch."
1.0,8-12,"I swear, this film is what is inside my head, more than any other movie I've ever seen.  In my opinion, this is Fellini's best (although La Dolce Vita is a very close second), and this is hands-down Mastroianni's best performance."
1.0,8-12,"what an amazing journey into the middle-aged man's psyche...but if you watch it with the sound off, the visuals are purely breath-taking (even Fellini played with the idea in the opening scene, so why not?)...a cinematic treasure!"
1.0,8-12,A must see for anyone who needs inspiration by something completely visually stimulating.
1.0,8-12,Truly a miraulus masterpiece. A director who just couldn't figure out what to do with his movie makes a movie about a director who doesn't know what to do with his movie. This is a must see for any type of moviegoer.
1.0,8-12,"I didn't catch it all in the first viewing, but a very subtle film about love, life, and family. The main character is very rich in layers as he goes through his life."
1.0,8-12,i've been watching this movie for as long as i can remember and i never try to analyze it but rather just feel it as it unfolds. fellini is like no other and has always kept me guessing. mesmerizing
1.0,8-12,"A ravishing compendium of sights, sounds, and performances in a film that has the great Federico Fellini turn creative block into transcendent art. Not to be ignored."
1.0,8-12,Cinema has Ended here!
1.0,8-12,"A masterpiece , Love how Fellini plays with the medium in this one."
1.0,8-12,Kuvan ja ajatuksen liitto. Ajattomia pohdintoja ja kuvia. Fellinin ironia tekee 8Â½:sta myÃ¶s syntisen hauskan.
1.0,8-12,Don't think I will ever finish this movie... absolutly fantastic!!
1.0,8-12,"I agree with Ebert. Film is about images. If all you want is story, go read a book. If you feel the same way, then this is a masterpiece."
1.0,8-12,"Sure, I may be a Fellini junkie, but I never get tired of this flick. Just the way the camera moves through this story is dreamy. Quite a journey!"
1.0,8-12,Fellini was a ridiculously good director and this is a ridiculously good film. I can only think of a couple that I like better than this one. Easily one of the greatest ever made.
1.0,8-12,"Ultimately, this is a really funny movie. It's obvious from a lot of the reviews here that many people don't know a comedy when they see one."
1.0,8-12,This is such a cool movie in so many ways.
1.0,8-12,Si esta no es la mejor pelicua de la historia pega en el palo.La genialidad de Fellini en su maxima expresion.Si de verdad les gusta el cine estan obligados a ver este film y las demas joyas de Federico.
1.0,8-12,"Mental opening, the best ever portrayal of a dream I've ever seen. Great."
1.0,8-12,"A masterpiece of all time, no more words. Strong charachters and Fellini's ability to ride us to a thick border between reality and fantasy. I finally understood the strong influences with T. Gilliam's Brazil."
1.0,8-12,"The more and more great movies I see, the more and more I realize how much of a mark 8 1/2 has made on my life; one that no other movie can accomplish for me."
1.0,8-12,Do you know how to love?
1.0,8-12,Classic! An Original! The cinematography has been copied over and over. Fellini's Finest
1.0,8-12,"""Happiness is being able to tell the truth without ever making anybody suffer."" Great film!"
1.0,8-12,Il cinema e l'arte forse qui s'incontrano...
1.0,8-12,This film shows the metaphorical possibilities of film.
1.0,8-12,le finale de ce film me fait tjs pleurer...
1.0,8-12,One of the greatest movies of all times. Inspired me in so many ways.
1.0,8-12,This is possibly one of the greatest movies of all time
1.0,8-12,"By blurring the lines between dreams, memories, and the present, Fellini produces the most accurate reproduction of the experience of life ever to be captured on film. If you've ever wondered what it's like to have other people call you an artist, this film will let you live it."
1.0,8-12,The opening scene...wow. It sets a great symbol for the rest of the film. I love how the transitions between reality and surrealism become less and less clear as the film progresses.
0.0,the_nice_guys,"It was trying to be kitschy and cute, but failed miserably...Unless horrible OVER-acting is kitschy and cute. AWFUL!"
1.0,the_nice_guys,Best movie of 2016 by miles.

1.0,the_nice_guys,"Incredible performances, great comedy and cool action make The Nice Guys an awesome flick."
0.0,the_nice_guys,"Saw this on a flight from Dallas to LA. Should have slept instead. It's a doubly horrible movie because it wastes the talents of some pretty decent actors. But the lunkheaded script, oceans of pointless blood, and rampant and gratuitous misogyny would swamp even the best talent. Steer clear."
1.0,the_nice_guys,Had me laughing all the way to the end.
1.0,the_nice_guys,This is a really good and really funny movie. Crowe and Gosling are hilarious together. Lots of laugh out loud moments.

1.0,the_nice_guys,Really funny. Ryan Gosling is one of the best slapstick comedians I've seen in a long time--a lost art. Russell Crowe anchors the movie with an understated performance that perfectly complements Gosling's. Nicely written & lot's of fun.

1.0,the_nice_guys,Very good movie very funny has a lot of action
1.0,the_nice_guys,"This film exceeded my expectations, it was entertaining and humorous throughout the film. Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling worked well together. Angourie Rice(Marches daughter) was an interesting character and not just some useless kid."

1.0,the_nice_guys,One of the best buddy cop movies ever made if not the best one
1.0,the_nice_guys,Go watch this movie! Shane Black makes what is in my opinion a great spiritual sequel to Kiss Kiss Bang Bang. It was so refreshing watching a comedic LA Noir film. Crowe and Gosling and amazing and this movie is so much fun. One of my top 10 for 2016 and I own this.
0.0,the_nice_guys,Am I the only one that thought this movie was terrible? I feel like I just wasted 2 hours of my life.

0.0,the_nice_guys,"As a big Russell Crowe fan, I found this movie to be the worst piece of trash of his career. The story was full of holes, the buddy cop thing didn't work, and the treatment of the teen girls in this movie was often exploitative, disgusting, not funny. This is an embarrassingly bad film."
1.0,the_nice_guys,"This movie was hilarious!! We accidentally came across it looking for something to watch, and even though we hadn't even heard of it before then, we decided to give it a shot. Definitely recommend!!"
1.0,the_nice_guys,Crowe and Gosling are the comedy duo everyone needs.

1.0,the_nice_guys,A very compelling action/comedy film.
1.0,the_nice_guys,"A masterpiece, in my opinion. Like the classics of the 80s: a little odd and superbly acted, written, and directed."
0.0,the_nice_guys,"Disappointing. Deadpool was raunchy and hilarious. This had the gratuitous nudity, erotic dancing, and vulgarity, but the plot and dialogue fell flat."
1.0,the_nice_guys,With great performances throughout and hilarious writing it's the perfect blend of action and comedy. Here's hoping for a Nice Guys 2.
1.0,the_nice_guys,Really funny movie. Loved the characters. Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling are perfect together. Highly recommended!!
0.0,the_nice_guys,"Bad. Bad. Bad. Everything. Bad. You have to wonder about a society that produces such a film and thinks it entertainment. Pedestrian acting, unbearably clichéd and slower than a dead snail-words fail me. Bottom line: Made for Trump U freshmen."
0.0,the_nice_guys,The worst Russell Crowe moving I've ever seen
0.0,the_nice_guys,As a drama it was definitely a bit boring but there were funny moments especially Ryan Gosling and the teenage actress playing his daughter.

0.0,la_la_land,Musicals like this just dont work in this day and age. It feels unnatural and forced the way the songs are incorporated. At least with Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly you had panache and grace in their movements.

1.0,la_la_land,Odiosaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
0.0,la_la_land,"Borderline boring! If Hollywood want to bring back the musical, they'll have to work a lot harder. The marketing for this movie was greater than the movie itself."

1.0,up,This movie was perfect
1.0,up,my favorite of all time :)
1.0,up,The most emotionally masterful Pixar work since The Lion King.

1.0,up,I consider this to be the best animated movie ever made. This is Pixar's finest and a perfect movie!
0.0,up,"Overhyped, Overblown, and Overrated, it can't be overstated. Animation that boast a greatness to come leaves us with unimaginative characters and a forced jumbled plot that takes itself WAY to seriously. Any genuine feeling soon becomes sappy in the run of its manipulative story telling."
1.0,up,"A clever, heartwarming masterpiece. Everything about the film works: the comedy, the story, the main characters, the side characters, the animation. Movies don't often come as perfect as this one."
1.0,up,"The beginning of Up is highly emotional and if those ten minutes alone were a short film, it would be just as great. This story has a basic enough plot for a Disney film and a couple of laughs manage to get in too."
1.0,up,"Heart touching, this is Pixar's best movie. It speaks to more mature audiences while being entertaining for the little ones. Up is an instant classic from 2009 to now, and should be one of the proudest animation ideas of all time."
1.0,up,Just amazing. The first ten minutes are heartbreaking.
1.0,up,"Any movie that can tell such a cute, depressing, and detailed story in such a short time, being the opening, is just perfect. I cried before the true adventure even began... I don't know what that says about me, but it says a lot about the movie."
1.0,up,Wonderful and captivating film
1.0,up,*sniffle... Beautiful...
1.0,up,"Simply breathaking, heart touching, PERFECT movie."

1.0,up,"Up is an exciting, hilarious, masterful work from Pixar."

1.0,up,The best family film of mortality EVER!

1.0,up,"Aug 2013 viewing: I forgot how much I really loved this movie. Changed it to 5 stars. :)Very cute, sweet movie. I would have liked to understand a bit more about why the adventurer turned from host to villain so quickly, but otherwise very enjoyable film."

1.0,up,"Brilliant, cute, action packed emotional film with a great plot."

1.0,up,Beautiful and touching
1.0,up,This is the best Disney animation movie ever
1.0,up,An exceptionally unique masterpiece. Pixar proved it still has what it takes with this one.
1.0,up,I can't even begin to tell you how much I love this movie. The first 8 minutes of the film send you whirling through every emotion you have. This is one of my all time favorite Pixar films.
1.0,up,I could not love this movie more!
1.0,up,"One of my all time favorites. Dug steals the show. The first few minutes have almost no talking, but still told one of the best love stories ever. If you didn't cry in this movie you're a liar."
1.0,up,"A beautiful film for both children and adults alike. With the unusual quality of primarily being a children's film, while also tackling some of the deeper themes of life, that adults would relate to, heart-warming."
1.0,up,"Excellent movie! Most depressed Disney movie before Toy Story 3, but still good."
1.0,up,Animated Masterpiece...
1.0,up,"a heartbreaking romance between the old man and his wife, a father and son story between the old man and the kid, and an adventure story. mixing in some elements of a mid life crises film, and fantasy elements as well, and you got one of the best animated films of all time."
1.0,up,"First movie in a while to make me cry. Everything, from animation to storytelling is perfect."
1.0,up,One of the greatest and most tragic love stories ever told and that is just the first 10 minutes. Up has a lot to live up to considering the opening sequence and the plot requires the suspension of belief on epic levels but Up never fails to be great. All I can say is Squirrel!!
1.0,up,"A sad, but still heartwarming Pixar movie."
1.0,up,"Definitely my favorite animated film. One of my favorite all-time films. Arguably Disney-Pixars most sophisticated use of theme, message, and storytelling. At times funny but never gimmicky, at times devastatingly poignant but never sappy. A true must-see film for all ages."
1.0,up,Favorite movie of all-time
1.0,up,"This, in my opinion, is the best animated film ever. It's so touching, and very heartfelt."

1.0,up,My Favorite Pixar movie of them all
1.0,up,"Exceeds expectations, even from Pixar."
1.0,up,"If I'm asked what's best of Pixar, I'll point my finger to this one."
1.0,up,Pixar does it again with this touching masterpiece. Anyone who's ever had a relative diagnosed with a fatal disease will truly connect.
1.0,up,the best kid moviefor adults
1.0,up,This is an amazing movie that proves that anybody can achieve something no matter how old. This is an amazing comedy and a great story. Pixar has done it again
1.0,up,One of the greatest animated movies since Disney's golden age. It tells an important story and deals with a difficult subject but is still fun for kids or anybody really.
1.0,up,This movie is perfect in every single way
1.0,up,nothing beats the first 10mins
1.0,up,An absolute masterpiece from the Pixar brand.
1.0,up,Best animated film in history
1.0,up,I laughed. I cried. I pretty much experienced the full gamut of human emotions.
1.0,up,"The first 7-10 minutes are movie making at its best, encapsulating two full lives in that short space of time. Amazing and deeply moving. The movie gets better from there."
1.0,up,This is 5/5 for the first 10 minutes alone
1.0,up,"by far my favorite pixar movie, possibly my second favorite animated movie"

1.0,up,I always get tear up at the beginning of this masterpiece.
1.0,up,A movie about loss that leaves you uplifted. Another Pixar masterpiece.
1.0,up,"Pixar's uplifting, yet, somber tale of a widowed man whose journey of seeking to fulfill his wife's lifelong aspiration turns awry is, for a lack of a better word, a soon-to-be classic."
1.0,up,This movie made me cry and had deep underlying message. It was cute too.
1.0,up,Beautiful little love story intro and great message.
0.0,up,It tries to make you feel hope by showing you dazzling animation of an old man and a kid being really high in the sky. But there's no actual thematic elements or characterizations to make you feel this! It left me feeling more angered by fake hope rather than uplifted by real hope.
1.0,up,Great movie! Saw it with my kids and had to hide my tears at one point so they wouldn't see. This movie is way beyond expectations!
1.0,up,"Emotionally charged and very funny, this film will stick with you for a long time."
1.0,up,One of my Favourites
1.0,up,I love ice age 4I love up

1.0,up,excellent movie. I do not rate movies 5 very often this one is a exception. very funny especially dug. Carl is a grumpy but charming in a way and Russell is the type of kid you want to adopt. all I can say is WATCH IT

1.0,get_out,"Most refreshing, original horror film in decades."
0.0,get_out,Every living person I know including Nigs don't want to be Nigs. So this story arc is basically crap. Dumb ass producers at least write a story that is believable. They got the title right. Get the fuck out!!

1.0,get_out,Best movie of 2017 in my option. The twist is just perfect
0.0,get_out,"I did not enjoy this movie. The only thing this movie offers is suspense and that's only because it's so far out there that anything can happen. Acting wasn't the greatest, story line was terrible. There are many holes in the story that left me unsatisfied."
1.0,get_out,"The plot for Get Out was perfectly conceived and thought out, with the importance of race being a driving part of the story, and its many turns and subliminal messaging made it really fun to see, with some gorey and shock humour in there, too."
1.0,get_out,This movie did more for my mixed-race mental health than any therapy or medicine ever has. I am grateful for this movie every day- In a cry-laugh-cringe-laugh-cry sort of way.
0.0,get_out,White people suck...the end. The only thing that kept me interested was the wave of white guilt that by design came over me. If this film was meant to make race relations better I can assure you it fell flat on it's face.

0.0,get_out,Straight racist propaganda... you can keep that crap.

1.0,get_out,Best movie out there!!! Funny and a great thriller movie. Watch and u will not be disappointed!!!
1.0,get_out,"A fantastically crafted story that uses the horror genre to bring America's history of slavery into the current day. With a building sense of dread, levels of racism are pealed back until the final, horrifying reveal."
1.0,get_out,"Simplemente increíble,una historia bien contada, editada y actuada. La sutil ciencia ficción es genial."
1.0,get_out,"A horror movie with something to say. Jordan Peele's get out is a social stament on our culture. With great performances and a non-stop script, get out is a modern day twilight zone with a social commentary that leaves you thinking."

1.0,get_out,"This is the most inventive and original films to come out in a long time. A round of applause for Jordan Peele. This movie was highly entertaining.

0.0,get_out,The most overrated film of all the time.
0.0,get_out,The plot is dumber than any of the cheesy Friday the 13th or Jason movies ever made. Ridiculous that it's up for best picture. Clown world.
1.0,get_out,"A smart script and nuanced direction make this film an unforgettable experience. One of the best films of 2017, if not THE best."
0.0,get_out,It was really stupid. And I couldn't help but get the feeling that it was pushing a liberal agenda. Also this film was obviously race baiting and if the roles were reversed there would be a massive outcry from the black community. This movie was racist and distasteful.
1.0,get_out,"I Really Like The Movie, Keep Me Thinking And The Plot Twist Are Awesome."
1.0,get_out,"An excellent Scary Thriller, with a hint of horror"
0.0,get_out,Pretentious over rated movie made for the awards

0.0,get_out,Absolutely chod. Would rather watch a .gif of a hippo spraying dung about than watch this again.
0.0,get_out,pretty much the worst movie of the past decade - really corny - needed to be edited so it wasn't choppy from scene to scene. say your time and watch basketball instead.

0.0,get_out,"Unoriginal, no suspense."
0.0,get_out,Could not find one redeemable thing about this movie. Boring the whole way through.
0.0,get_out,This movie was very bad who would think white people would kidnap black men to transfer their mind to them . The story has no plot and was not scary . i don't see how this movie made 250 million and the director needs to find another career.
0.0,get_out,"I enjoyed the Skeleton Key more, which is the film that Get Out ripped off."
1.0,get_out,"It's properly scary and just phenomenally well done. Get Out is a beat for beat perfect horror movie and a surprisingly intricate and nuanced exploration of race relations in America. If you aren't yelling at the screen by halfway through the movie, I don't know who you are."
0.0,get_out,"Most racist and boring ""scary"" movie ever! #OVERATED"
0.0,get_out,Not that great - Kind of like 2017s answer to the original Night of the Living Dead - more of a cult classic than a good movie

1.0,get_out,"This movie runs the complete gambit of what a movie like this can do. It's funny, creepy, thought-provoking, relevant, and creative. It's one of those movies that just does what it does exactly the way it should. It's a riot."

1.0,get_out,Loved every minute of it.
0.0,get_out,Jordan Peele stole The Skelton Key plotline and made it transparently racist. There is zero subtlety to this film. All it does is reveal what the auteur director thinks about white people which is much more racist than the characters in the film itself.
1.0,get_out,"Amazing film, filled with suspense and master class in directing; not one cheap thrill or jumpscares."
1.0,get_out,One of the best horror movies I've ever seen. Perfectly executed.

1.0,get_out,Very creative and suspenseful story and a great cast. Excellent work by Jordan Peele.
0.0,get_out,"This movie gets great reviews because of the PC garbage era. He's a Black guy getting attacked by a White Family, and of course, we've never really seen that before in a movie, outside of slave films. Anyone who likes this movie is clearly an idiot."

1.0,get_out,One of the best thrillers I've seen by far. When I saw the trailer I thought this was a joke but it blew me away and gave me chills down my spine.
1.0,get_out,I'm not one to like horror or thriller movies but I really enjoyed this one. It's just so well done!
0.0,get_out,Just a horrible movie with bad acting and a cheap storyline. Peele does great at comedy and should focus his works there. This was more racial crap that had a bad ending.
1.0,get_out,One of the best films I've ever seen and unlike anything else that came out this year. Kudos to Peele for his forward thinking direction and script and the brilliant acting of the whole cast. Would be great to see Kaluuya get a Best Actor Oscar nom!
0.0,get_out,"Wow, incredibly disappointed with this film, had just high expectations going to see it. Sometimes I really don't understand what some people see in a movie, it's not a horror movie at all, not the least bit scary and hardly interesting."
0.0,get_out,All white people are bad. That is the plot. A rehashing of Stepford Wives. This movie is trying to be the Deliverance of its time but falling way short.
1.0,get_out,"Get Out succeeds in every area. Jordan Peele crafts a fun, thrilling, and comedic ride, while also tackling various social issues. You can't help but scream ""GET OUT"" as you progress through the film. As far as I'm concerned, this film is a masterpiece."
0.0,get_out,"Nothing original about the film. It's honestly racist and misogynous. Shows how blacks view whites and white women in particular. Nothing original in the ideas, script, direction, production, acting."
1.0,get_out,"A mixture of humor, thrills, chills, and action rolled up into a socially relevant story that entertains."

1.0,get_out,"Moving and brilliant, an amazing satirical take on the generic white wealthy family."
1.0,get_out,"Predictable, yet Jordan Peele's attempt at a horror movie is well executed.

1.0,get_out,Really awesome performances by the leads. Amazing story too.
1.0,get_out,This is not a horror movie. It's a Comedy. It's about black folk that watches too much TV while sitting in the sunken place letting their brains to be washed with Liberal Marxist agenda ;) One of the best movies I have ever watched!
1.0,get_out,The kind of movie that entertains in an uncomfortable way and sticks with you because it makes you think. Well constructed suspense tale with more going on than most films of the genre.

1.0,get_out,Amazing movie that EVERYBODY should see.
0.0,get_out,It left a bitter taste in my mouth. I thought it to be one of those movies that give the horror genre a bad name. I anticipated the resolution from the first 10-20 min of the movie before even the premise was clearly set and I was right.

1.0,get_out,Awesome movie. Jordan Peele is a great director!
1.0,get_out,"Get Out is important because of it's knowledge of horror. It focuses on the story, and the scares come naturally from it. Most horror movies these days seem to plan the scares before they plan the movie."

1.0,get_out,"Flat out incredible. What a directorial debut. Arguably the best movie of the year. Just an awesome blend of old school horror, new school social satire, and hilarious comedy."
1.0,get_out,I was really impressed and moved. original ideas. I am interested in the next movie this director has to offer. all the negative reviews were really interesting to read. people need to appreciate the acting and having the guts to try something different. they should sink into the floor. lol
0.0,get_out,"Combo of Skeleton Key, Wickerman, Stepford Wives and a host of others. Was good in the first third but was easy to guess the story and went down quickly after that.The way he escapes is ludicrous and contrived.Save your money it'll be free on Netflix soon."

1.0,get_out,Best movie I've seen this year. Thought it would be kinda predictable but the twists just kept coming.

1.0,manhattan,Woody again directs a movie with wit and heart. His romance for New York is shown with his great visuals of the city. Great performances from Allen and Diane Keaton and Mariel Hemingway.

1.0,manhattan,"100% Incredible, one of the best movies of Wody Allen"
1.0,manhattan,"one of the great romances of cinema, as charming and captivating as Casablanca, and as witty and funny as Bergman's Smiles of a Summer Night. And i agree with Roger Ebert, it's ""not about love, but loss""."

1.0,manhattan,"It ranks among Allen's best works, his writing, directing, and even his acting is at his level best. It combines the humor of Annie Hall and the more reflective nature of his later stuff, so its really just a combination of all his greatest strengths."

0.0,manhattan,"Saw this because Meryl has a bit part, and when I say bit its an overstatement. I think she is in it maybe a minute, I love ya Meryl, but this wasn't worth it. I'm not a Woody Allen fan, and I find it hard to believe Meryl would be his ex-wife, among other things, in this crap movie."
1.0,manhattan,"This is one movie which actually gets better and better when you watch it again...Allen handles the intricacies of relationships so beautifully, and depicts Manhattan in a great light, Diane keaton and Allen always gel like anything and Meryl Streep though she comes in 2 frames looks sizzling."

1.0,manhattan,(****): Thumbs Up  Well-acted and well-directed. One of the best films of the 1970's.
1.0,manhattan,"This and ANNIE HALL are Woody Allen's defining works as a filmmaker, never has he spun a yarn of relationships, sex, and conversation in such a virtuosic manner. The fact that it's probably his best-looking work visually doesn't hurt either."
1.0,manhattan,oh my GOD ... such an amazing story line.
1.0,manhattan,"An extremely unconventional romantic-comedy, which goes in unexpected places, is a continuation of Woody Allen's romance with New York. Shot in utterly breathetaking black-and-white, a truly beautiful film about people walking around, talking, sleeping together, arguing, talking and ad infinum."
1.0,manhattan,I liked the way he liked his city =]
1.0,manhattan,Woody's best! One of my favorites
0.0,manhattan,did not like this at all

1.0,manhattan,"masterpiece ....i am addicted to this filmmaker and i have seen all his films , even when just acting in another s film  but who is his best film ? this one or Zeling ?"
1.0,manhattan,"Even though this is an old movie, Manhattan still reflects the sexual relationship in the urban jungle. This movie is so simple that you can really enjoy the pure beauty of a cinema. Manhattan is also a classical presentation of the life of a New Yorker: literatus, the BOBOs, and artistic."
1.0,manhattan,New York har aldrig varit vackrare i svartvitt Ã¤n i den hÃ¤r filmen.
0.0,manhattan,I have a feeling that people who feel overly important will enjoy this.
1.0,manhattan,"I love this movie (filmed in glorious black and white), despite the fact that Woody Allen's personal history might tend to make it suspect."
1.0,manhattan,"A masterpiece amongst Woody Allen's films, comprised of intellectual wit and a very talented, well-acted cast... Not to mention, extraordinarily beautiful cinematography of a such a great city.""New York was his town, and it always would be..."""
1.0,manhattan,"Dealing with satisfaction, heartbreak, hope, and decay, ""Manhattan"" is Woody Allen's best film--he tackles each theme with his signature wit and insight in addition to garnering terrific performances from Keaton and Hemingway. It's the quintessential Woody Allen movie, simply put."
1.0,manhattan,"Beautifully photographed in black and white, if I wasn't in love with New York before I am now. Woody Allen's aptly called ""love song to New York"", Manhattan, was romantic, witty and full of captivating disenchantment."
1.0,manhattan,Diane Keaton and the cinematography
1.0,manhattan,"Hard to pick out a fault. The second Woody Allen film I watched, having already got to know Annie Hall pretty well... Ended up liking this one even more which was surprising. Undeniably witty, well-shot, casted... can't go wrong with this in my opinion."
1.0,manhattan,Allen's masterpiece.
1.0,manhattan,Woody Allen's best since Annie Hall.
1.0,manhattan,"I truly love Woody Allen, the women in this movie esp. Meryl, NEW YORK, cerebral self-discursive dialogue, sexuality, insecurity, the beauty of life, and this movie."
1.0,manhattan,a wise romantic dramedy which is lesser than Annie Hall but is more true than any of Allen's romantic movies. Mariel Hemingway and Diane Keaton are superb and definitive Allen females.
1.0,manhattan,Creo que lo que me gusta de Woody es que me da la oportunidad de ser un cotilla de entrar en las vidas de sus personajes y regodearme con sus éxitos y fracasos da la oportunidad de ver lo universal que son las búsquedas afectivas o de la felicidad.
1.0,manhattan,EÃ©n van de best Woody Allens: hilarisch met New York in prachtig zwart/wit.
1.0,manhattan,the best woody allen movie EVER

1.0,manhattan,Amazing dialogue. Great music. Beautiful.
1.0,manhattan,Allen's best film IMHO
1.0,manhattan,"Perhaps Woody Allen's best and most honest of many wonderful and honest films. At times both intellectual, poignant and hilarious. His heroic quest for romance is amazingly done and very touching."
1.0,manhattan,"Absolutely classic. Woody Allen's best film, easily."
1.0,manhattan,Neck and neck with Annie Hall for Woody's best flick.
1.0,manhattan,this film is so beautiful to watch and Allen is so perfect for this role. This film delves into things more interesting and more realistic than Annie Hall. It' so interesting and so textured with a chaotic tale of love in the setting of an homage to the city that Allen loves.
1.0,manhattan,My favorite Woody Allen...
1.0,manhattan,"Another great work from Woody Allen. More than a few similarities to Annie Hall, but make no mistake: Manhattan is its own film, and it's just as great."
1.0,manhattan,Nazis understand baseball bats!
1.0,manhattan,"Wow. I loved this movie from heads to tails. Probably the best lines in the movie are delivered by Tracy, the pearl being the ironic ""You should have a little faith in people"" towards the end. Excellent shots of New York. Great Score. One of my favorites."
1.0,manhattan,"Manhattan jamas lucio tan hermosa y romantica como en esta cinta, una obra maestra del director Woody Allen, que debe verse como una secuela no oficial de ""Annie Hall""."
1.0,manhattan,"Manhattan is definitely my favorite Woody Allen film. Shot is stunning black & white, and full of smart humor, this is a beautiful little story about the complications of love, and is itself a love letter from Allen to the Big Apple. Manhattan is a winner."
1.0,manhattan,"Diane Keaton's smart, beautiful insecurity, combative pedantry, neurotic preoccupations, fickle cuntiness & tendency to date short, balding men really appeals to me. 5 stars."
1.0,manhattan,Probably my favorite thing Woody Allen's directed.
1.0,manhattan,"What a Marvelous movie, the beginning dialogue voiced by Woody and the Black and White shoot of Manhattan is mesmerising !"
1.0,manhattan,"one of allen's more romantic films. written, acted and shot perfectly."
1.0,manhattan,Solid performances and a mature Allen analyzing all aspects of human coupling.
1.0,manhattan,"I love that this movie is made up of a string of opened and honest conversations. Sure some elements of the conversations may be a bit pretentious for my liking, but it also took place in my favourite era in a city I long to visit."
1.0,manhattan,woody peaking in hostility A++
1.0,manhattan,Less meta than Annie Hall and completely gorgeous.
1.0,manhattan,"Allen's finest film is not only a portrait of the city he loves but also of the irrationality behind human relationships. His characters are some of the most authentic he's ever created and he plays his own role more toned down than normal, generating real sympathy."
1.0,manhattan,"woody allen, tony roberts, mariel hemingway, diane keaton"
1.0,manhattan,Woody Allen is the world's greatest story teller... nuff said

1.0,manhattan,Meryll!!!!!(L)(L)GREAAATTTTT ammaaaaziiigggg
1.0,manhattan,"Annie Hall is funnier, and overall better as well, but Manhattan sure has the more beautiful cinematography. Still five-stars for sure, though. Another excellent look into relationships by the great Woody Allen."

1.0,beatles_a_hard_days_night,"A Hard Day's Night (1964) ???? / ????Classic Beatles film is a sheer delight, a look at a ""typical"" day in their life. Many memorable vignettes. A totally wild, imaginative, crazy movie with songs from their first three albums on the soundtrack."

1.0,beatles_a_hard_days_night,"A psychedelic trip back to America's love affair with the invasion of British Rock and Roll, -A great way to introduce the history of Music and its impact on the Vietnam War, the American Family and the question of post 50's idealisms"
0.0,beatles_a_hard_days_night,"How this movie made it on RT's list of top 100 classics movies is beyond me. The only aspect I enjoyed is the music. Other than that, the film was just pointless and plotless. And such a bore."

0.0,beatles_a_hard_days_night,I couldn't watch beyond the first 20 minutes - people only rate this highly because of it's soundtrack and the nostalgia behind it. The actual plot and acting is a gruesomely awful school boy project. It even makes Purple Rain look good!

1.0,beatles_a_hard_days_night,"The Beatles seem like they're just going with the flow, not knowing why these hordes of people are banging on their car. Paul's grandfather (who's that little old man?) is a great character to add in, and the animosity between Shake and Norm is genius (stop bein' taller than me!)"

1.0,ghostbusters,"Ghostbusters is an immensely peasing interweaving of big-budget special effects and comedy with a performance from Murray, oozing sleazy charm and cockiness that has the ability to steal the scene even when he shares it with a gigantic, stampeding marshmallow man, which is no mean feat."

1.0,ghostbusters,"An awesome movie, and my favorite 80's film."
1.0,tampopo,A series of apparently unrelated and often surreal side dishes complement a charming and lighthearted main course. This film is a zesty and satisfying examination of food and it's role in life and society. Strange and unusual ingredients combine for a surprisingly rich experience. Not to be missed!

1.0,tampopo,Un film à voir obligatoirement. Period.
1.0,tampopo,"An hysterical film that works on many levels. It's purely outrageous at times, and serious social observation at others. Ultimately, however, it's what started my great love of noodles!"
1.0,tampopo,"One of my favorite movies. It's random, idiosyncratic, funny, sad in turns. The basic premise is that a truck driver agrees to train a widow to be one the best ramen chefs in Japan. With many side stories on the role of food in life and how food and sex are intertwined."

1.0,tampopo,"It's like Bunuel in Japan, though that is not to cheapen its charm by likening it to something else. It has a taste all its own. Satirical and ridiculous, but at the same time strikingly genuine. A comedic masterpiece."
1.0,tampopo,this is just about the best movie ever made.
1.0,tampopo,"Hilarious film about foodies, filmed as a spoof of spaghetti westerns. Some great blackout comedy moments inserted as interludes have nothing to do with the underlying plot. The more you know about Japanese culture, the more you'll understand this film."

1.0,tampopo,â??Elin Melchior:This film focuses on many of the more bizarre aspects of food in Japan. From the search for the perfect bowl or ramen noodles to eating sushi off of a woman's bare stomach. It has to be seen to be believed. ---- Library Description: Film; Japanese Noodle Westernâ??

1.0,tampopo,"Surprise, I love food movies! This is my favourite. A japanese obsessional quest of oneself thrue the perfect noodle soup? Beautifull! A main story ponctuated by little clips to the glory of excesses food can you bring to! Moving, funny and profond! Not to miss!"
1.0,tampopo,One of my favorite movies of all time.
1.0,tampopo,This movie is an example of superior Japanese Cinematic construction. Taking a subject that should by all means be boring and making it hilarious!

1.0,tampopo,"Quintessential Itami. People come from all walks of life but what ties us in common is that we all have to eat. It is, however, our attitude towards what, how and why we eat that sets us apart. Masterly satirical. Love it!"

1.0,tampopo,"This was one of the best movies I've seen thus far!!! The short vignettes in between were brilliant...a characteristic I find common in Asian movies - Japanese, Indian... you name it.

1.0,tampopo,Incomparable. Only Juzo Itami could make a fascinating film about ramen.

1.0,tampopo,A great movie with several distinct vignettes surrounding intimacy through food and personal relations.
1.0,tampopo,An incredibly original movie. Itami's revamping of the Western genre through the world of noodle-making is both hilarious and quite touching.
1.0,tampopo,"First warning: If you don't understand Japanese cultural references the satire of this movie will be lost with you. Other than that, it's an awesome tale of several characters, each vignetter seamlessly transitioning to the next."
1.0,tampopo,Hard to find but a great great film. Funny and light yet serious. The quest for the ultimate bowl of noodle soup is a great metaphor for the way of the Japanese but told in a wandering cowboy style with many vignettes. See it if you can find it!

1.0,tampopo,Juzo Itami's most famous film
1.0,tampopo,"Food, sex, several storylines for the ADD in you, and many classic scenes, along with the dichotomy of good within evil and vice versa. Again one of my favorites - makes you want to get a bowl of soup, and NEVER be satisfied with just anything. The same with life..."

1.0,lost_in_translation,beautiful pictures. calm and quiet mood. great
1.0,lost_in_translation,"I like so many things about this film, but one of the main things I liked was how it relied on friendship rather than romance to bond us to characters. This should have won the Oscar for Best Picture, as I just couldn't get into Lord of the Rings."

1.0,lost_in_translation,Stunning film with a subtle and touching plot.
1.0,lost_in_translation,"Lost in Translation is a charming yet thoughtful movie, tinged with a beautiful sense of melancholy, a very human ennui communicated through the superb acting of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson (both of them should do more movies like this)."
0.0,lost_in_translation,Unwatchable. One of the few movies I've seen that was so painful I walked out.
0.0,lost_in_translation,Movie about two Americans in Tokyo who meet by chance and spend the week together having a good time. I usually enjoy these types of movies but this one bored me to tears. I just didn't believe a hot chick like Scarlet would EVER hang out with an old man like Bill. Not happening.

1.0,lost_in_translation,"If I told you Bill Murray could play a character so subtle and sentimental, that the comedy of the film strengthens the films overall artwork, it would be hard to believe.

And even Melvin Douglas is great as the poor, slow on the uptake gent that Russell thinks she wants to marry. They really don't make them like this anymore."
1.0,his_girl_friday,"One of the greatest movies ever. I'm pretty sure that if I had been born a lot earlier, Cary Grant and I could have had a thing...pretty sure."
1.0,his_girl_friday,"funny,fast...total entertainment...."

1.0,his_girl_friday,One of the best's comedys ever.

1.0,his_girl_friday,Smart and witty. What a great story. Well conceived and executed. A thinking film.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Premise: ""A newspaper editor uses every trick in the book to keep his ace reporter ex-wife from remarrying.""He taught me everything I know. The fastest comedy (the script) ever made."
0.0,his_girl_friday,was bored. cary grant made very few movies i actually like.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"The wittiest and fastest paced (dialogue wise) movie I've ever seen. Movies like this don't exist anymore sadly. Highly recommended, if only for Carey Grant's performance"
1.0,his_girl_friday,~~~CARY GRANT~~~  ~~THAT'S ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW!!~~~
1.0,his_girl_friday,The dialogue is second to none; Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell are impeccable - as are Ms Russell's hats
1.0,his_girl_friday,Excellent movie! Lines are all delivered with perfect timing. Rosalind Russell is superb and Cary Grant is pure magic!
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Superior cast, script, delivery, pace and idea from Howard Hawks. Highly recommended."
1.0,his_girl_friday,cary grant is simply amazing!
1.0,his_girl_friday,Classic film for all involved. The lightning speed witty banter reminds me how bland the dialogue is in most movies nowadays.
1.0,his_girl_friday,The dialog is the music.
1.0,his_girl_friday,Eden najboljsih filmov vseh casov!
1.0,his_girl_friday,2 years before Casablanca but twice the lines
1.0,his_girl_friday,Hilarious fast paced comedy. They just don't make movies like this anymore.
1.0,his_girl_friday,It's always bothered me that Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell didn't make any other movies together.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Classic! The dialogue, the acting...all while looking effortlessly gorgeous. The old cliche that ""they don't make 'em like they used to"" is SO true. The Grant/Russell chemistry is amazing."
1.0,his_girl_friday,Great movie with lightning speed dialogue.
1.0,his_girl_friday,la mayor burla al periodismo de la historia. los dialogos son mas rapidos q disparos de Tommy Gun! Es una de las mejores comedias q he visto (si no es la mejor). Creo q solo se le compara Dr. Strangelove...
1.0,his_girl_friday,Cary Grant. Rosalind Russell. Dialogue so fast it'll make your head spin. This movie is the gold standard for screwball romantic comedies.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"There is nothing I don't like about this movie. It's funny, exciting, topical, and even a little touching. Plus, the acting is unbeatable and the liberties taken with the original play really enhance the story and make it far more interesting."
1.0,his_girl_friday,cary grant is always awesome
1.0,his_girl_friday,The thing that really makes this film pop was the chemistry and competition between Grant and Russell. Much of the film is adlibbed and was encouraged by Hawks. The best scene is when they're in the bar sitting around the table...the entire scene was shot in one take and is 90% adlib. Brilliant!
1.0,his_girl_friday,Try to keep up with the dialog in this forerunner to today's romantic comedy! The pace is pitch-perfect and Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell are divine.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"You ain't sweet on this picture show? That's a lot of hooey. I'd put my arm in a fire for this movie, up to here!"
1.0,his_girl_friday,One of my 5 favorite movie comedies of all time! Howard Hawks' brilliant direction & the snappy dialogue delivered by Cary Grant & Rosalind Russell make this a classic for the ages!

1.0,his_girl_friday,I Own and LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie! Cary is soo funny in this and the drop-dead BEAUTIFUL Rosalind Russell...classic performances by both greats!! If you haven't seen it...do so Immediately!
1.0,his_girl_friday,By far the funniest film from the Screwball era. Both Rosalind Russelland Cary Grant are mind blowingly funny.
1.0,his_girl_friday,The best film ever of a now extinct genre. Many have tried to revive the screwball comedy and all have failed. The perfect version of very good story.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"One of those great, razor-sharp comedies they just don't make anymore."
1.0,his_girl_friday,cary grant....howard hawks.....most badass rapid fire dialouge ever.....badass
1.0,his_girl_friday,"An witty, clever comedy that was entertaining from beginning to end."
1.0,his_girl_friday,"With characters moving at speed and brilliant dialogue being delivered at a machine gun rate, this is one of the great screwball comedies and a kick in the teeth for the many actresses such as Katharine Hepburn and Claudette Colbert who turned down the role of Hildy Johnson."
1.0,his_girl_friday,"A perfect comedy. Intelligent, cynical, rapid-fire dialogue, a uniformly excellent cast with the stars on top of their game. A stage adaptation that never feels stagey and that gives us a great battling love story to boot. Showing at the NFT as part of the Screwball Women season."
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Simple and charming. The wit crackles. Cary Grant is both debonair and absolutely hilarious, and Rosalind Russel is tough, brilliant, and vulnerable all at once."
1.0,his_girl_friday,This explains my love of newspeople. Cary Grant will be my love in heaven.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"clever, incredibly quick paced newspaper comedy about Grant trying to win back ex-wife."
1.0,his_girl_friday,Best screwball comedy ever. Grant and Russels dialogue is absolutely unbelievable it is so quick. Also Ralph Bellamy deserves a mention as the brilliant straight man to those two.
1.0,his_girl_friday,A Classic. Cary Grant is amazingly devious and Rosalind Russell is taking none of it.
1.0,his_girl_friday,really really great. witty and clever and fast. and the last half hour was so incredibly funny.
1.0,his_girl_friday,One of the all time greats! and one of the funniest movies ever made!
1.0,his_girl_friday,Amazing movie...dialogues are great..superbly acted...totally hilarious...not a second to lose
1.0,his_girl_friday,I gained even more respect for this film when I found out that the Russell-Grant dialogue was largely improvised.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Amazing dialogue, rapid-fire pacing and timeless wit. Not to be missed!"
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Fast paced and VERY funny! Great back-and-forth banter & bickering between ""Walter"" and ""Hilde"". One of my absolute favorites!"

1.0,his_girl_friday,If you love dialogue and laughter you have to see this!!! Cary is awesome and Rosalind is classic
1.0,his_girl_friday,One of the funniest most genius films ever made in America. Cary Grant and Rosalin Russell are amazing.
1.0,his_girl_friday,You can take Hitler and stick him on the funny page... this movie rocks! And did I mention it was directed by Howard Hawks?
1.0,his_girl_friday,Perhaps the greatest American Comedy ever made. Certainly the fastest dialogue I have ever come across. Hawks' direction is just as poignant. A personal favorite.
1.0,his_girl_friday,A comedy that amazingly has 100% spectacular writing and acting! This movie is a blast to watch and has all the right elements to make it a late gem of the screwball comedy era.
1.0,his_girl_friday,The fast-talking movie to end all fast-talking movies. It changed the face of American comedy and holds up so well it could make a killing if released today.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Howard Hawks is a God. This movie is a train. It doesn't let anything stop it up. A woman jumps out of a window and in less than thirty seconds, it returns it's machine-gun pace and witty dialogue. ...why can't I be more like Cary Grant? ...oh yeah, I'm hideous and completely lack any charm."
1.0,his_girl_friday,The best of the best.
1.0,his_girl_friday,Possibly the FUNNIEST movie ever made. Fact! Sure is fast....
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Brilliant, hilarious movie."
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Some of the best ad-libbed dialog ever. Wonderful tempo, and Roz Russell is phenomenal (Cary Grant's not too shabby either)."
1.0,his_girl_friday,The first 40 minutes might be the best stuff Hawks and Grant have ever done.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"The fastest mouths in the West. Perhaps my favorite comedy ever. The script is perfect, as well as the direction and acting. It could not have been more perfectly cast. Brilliant and thoroughly engaging from start to finish."
1.0,his_girl_friday,"A snappy, riotous office farce, His Girl Friday is quite simply one of the best comedies ever made. Cary Grant is astonishingly good and Rosalind Russell is wonderful too. It doesn't get any better than this."
1.0,his_girl_friday,"If you think you talk fast, watch this movie and compare. I love this movie."
1.0,his_girl_friday,Progressive cinema in the sense that it portrays modern gender roles for both female reporters and actresses being able to keep up with the male counterparts. Also progressive in the delivery of lightning speed banter.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Best fast-talking, classic Cary Grant comedy. If you don't listen UP you'll miss half the jokes. Just classically perfect!"
1.0,his_girl_friday,Seriously one of the best movies ever made. Lois Lane's character was inspired by this movie.
1.0,his_girl_friday,Classic film with humor that holds out today.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Inventive and vexing, the former for the time, the latter because, well, then a war happened, leaving people like me sitting around holding their dorks wunnerin: where could we have gone from there?"
1.0,his_girl_friday,Nothing less than five stars explains it. A completely entertaining and engauging movie. Cary Grant steals the show as always.
1.0,his_girl_friday,Talk about fast deliveries! This insanely fast paced comedy raises the bar regarding witty scripts. Cary Grant and the beautiful Rosalind Russell. Delightful.  The grandady of Gilmore Girls (if that ever helps).
1.0,his_girl_friday,Wonderfully witty and fast-paced. Cary Grant is superb (as always) and Rosalind Russell is great as well. Great film!
1.0,his_girl_friday,Howard Hawks doing it the way he duz best. Cary Grant and Roselind russell sparkle.
1.0,his_girl_friday,You can't stop laughing!
1.0,his_girl_friday,Hawks' fast comedy is just about the sharpest film I've seen. Russell and Grant were fantastic. They were so full of energy that it could only be actors with their level of skill who could make their entertaining exchanges work.
1.0,his_girl_friday,Perfectly written and performed screwball comedy. The fastest movie ever made.
1.0,his_girl_friday,There might be two lines of dialog in the whole film that don't make me laugh.
1.0,his_girl_friday,aww this movie was so sweet and funny..i love cary grant.
1.0,his_girl_friday,The Cary Grant-est movie ever.

1.0,his_girl_friday,One of the best examples of the fast talking sarcastic romantic comedies of the era. Holds up with the best of them.
1.0,his_girl_friday,Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell at their wise cracking fast talking best. Nearly 70 years after it was first released this is still hilarious.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Rosalind Russell set the bar very high for smart, sassy, fast talking broads. Truly a classic and worth seeing if you haven't."
1.0,his_girl_friday,Holy Shit! There's someone who talks more than AND faster than me!
1.0,his_girl_friday,One of my favorite Grant movies!
1.0,his_girl_friday,"smart, fast, funny. try to keep up with hildy and walter."
1.0,his_girl_friday,I have rented this many times because I thought this was a great Cary Grant movie.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Fabulously witty, Grant's most funniest performance in a lightning paced newspaper comedy. Features some of Grant's distinctive ad libs. When asked to describe his ex-wife's new fiancee, misplaces his line and instead comes up with ""Oh he looks like that film actor, Ralph Bellamy"". Classic."
1.0,his_girl_friday,fast-paced madness - Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell are fantastic. How can they talk that fast?
1.0,his_girl_friday,I think that I learned how to be a woman by watching old Rosalind Russell films. She rocks - always one scarcastic comment away from being a bitch but still so sweet!
1.0,his_girl_friday,this movie is pure fun especially if you catch the hidden jokes.
1.0,his_girl_friday,Grant and Russell are spectacular in this hit from 1940. The fast paced script and the obvious chemistry between Russell and Grant provides for a wonderful movie. A MUST for all Grant/Russell lovers!
1.0,his_girl_friday,A perfect example of it's kind. Fast witted dialogue that overlaps brilliantly just as it would do in real life. Grant & Russell have great chemistry and Hawks keeps things moving at such a pace you feel the tension build even though it is very much a comedy.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Cary Grant at his best, there really aren't movie star like him any more."
1.0,his_girl_friday,Brilliant all the way around.

1.0,his_girl_friday,a cute film witty and comic great classic.
1.0,his_girl_friday,i love cary grant! and fast-talking reporters!
1.0,his_girl_friday,The perfect screenplay. The dialogue has yet to be matched to this day.
1.0,his_girl_friday,Cary Grant was always at his best playing a smooth-talking rogue. This fast-paced intellectual comic masterpiece is one of his best. Rosalind Russell is his match (though much of her motivation seems sexist in this day and age).
0.0,his_girl_friday,"This movie fails to remind me that a woman only got one thing on her mind, and that is the reason for its low rating."
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Cary Grant and Howard Hawks, badass."
1.0,his_girl_friday,"""Hildy, don't be hasty! Remember my dimple!"""

1.0,his_girl_friday,"An unbelievably terrific movie - I could watch it over and over (in spite of some of Rosalind Russell's wacky outfits). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell are spectacular, and Howard Hawks is a master."
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Classic movie, a must for any film buff. Grant is a master at comedy, and his delivery shines in this fast-paced movie about journalism and justice."
1.0,his_girl_friday,A comic masterpiece with writing and performances as tight as a two hour magic act.
1.0,roman_holiday,"A ""must-watch"" movie showing the best of Hepburn and Peck, and the city of Rome. Romantic comedies are usually easy to forget, but this one has multiple scenes that are so iconic."
1.0,roman_holiday,"Sweet, charming, and classical at best, Roman Holiday sets the standards for the romantic comedy genre with icon Audrey Hepburn"
1.0,roman_holiday,I have no idea why... But obsessed!
1.0,roman_holiday,"The first parts of the movie is really just light hearted comedy, very fun to watch. You'd think it doesn't deserve the 98% in Rotten Tomatoes, but when you reach the climax and the ending scene, its the most beautifully acted romance. Personally my favorite ending in a romantic movie,"
1.0,roman_holiday,"Roman Holiday is as funny as it is beautiful, and sets the standard for the modern romantic comedy."
1.0,roman_holiday,"Dalton Trumbo's perfect script, flawlessly brought to life by Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck is a timeless classic that gets better with each viewing"
1.0,roman_holiday,"I haven't seen every romantic comedy ever made, But I can certainly see why ""Roman Holiday"" is considered the best romantic comedy ever made. Long after Peck, Hepburn, their characters, and the era they loved in have passed, I'm still hoping the best for them."
1.0,roman_holiday,"""Roman Holiday"" is remarkable just because Audrey Hepburn isn't gratingly over-the-top as she is in most movies. ""Roman Holiday"" is well-scripted and well-acted with gorgeous visuals shot on location in Italy. It's a charming film with wit fresh enough for a modern audience."
1.0,roman_holiday,"So understated - unimaginably so in today's fast-paced world. The last scene is unbearably poignant - yet completely silent, little movement, no music - just magical. Treasure this. M"
1.0,roman_holiday,The greatest performance of Audrey Hepburn's career.
1.0,roman_holiday,"GAH! WHY COULDN'T SHE JUST RUN AWAY WITH HIM?!?!?! Damn you, Royalty!!!"
1.0,roman_holiday,"Just because it is the combination of Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn, it makes the whole thing unbeatable. A forever classic this is."

1.0,roman_holiday,"A black and white movie, which is actually a historic one due to magnificent scenes shot in Rome in the 1950's (one of the first roles for Audrey Hepburn).

1.0,some_like_it_hot,"I have seen ""Some Like It Hot"" several times but never on a big screen with great sound. So thanks to The Zonita in Ampthill for showing this absolute classic the way it should be seen. I don't need to add much more except it is still very, very funny and brilliantly acted by everyone. Wonderful!"
1.0,some_like_it_hot,"""Nobody's perfect,"" Joe Brown says at the end. This classic comedy, however, very much is. The camera never swooned harder for Monroe than it did here.

1.0,tangerine_2015,"Fucking incredible movie. ""Old fashioned comedy"" is a bit of a stretch of a description... Tangerine is a very insightful film which breaks through the current meta of film making by, for instance, shooting the entire film using only iPhone 5s. Very artsy."
1.0,tangerine_2015,The life of transgenders and street workers alike is one superbly told in this high energy shot picture. The acting is terrific and the story is layered boldly until the very end.

1.0,tangerine_2015,"Impressive in its technological invention and in its naturalist presentation of life on the fringes of the down-and-out in LA. Thankfully, even though films like TANGARINE will not earn award recognition, this film exists to illustrate the diverse stories that exist in the human experience."
1.0,tangerine_2015,You need an open mind to like this movie. For me this movie was incredible!!
1.0,tangerine_2015,Kitana Rodriguez and Mya Taylor are brilliant.
1.0,tangerine_2015,its style is as important to the story as its script.
1.0,tangerine_2015,"Such a great great surprise. A movie about 2 transgender women but doesn't revolve around that. It's funny, current, fresh, and is amazing to see these 2 women perform and be amazing. Just netflix Tangerine immediately and watch it."

0.0,tangerine_2015,"Dreadful movie - a road trip movie to a place I never want to go to again. Not funny, not interesting, not enlightening, not engaging. I go to the movies a lot and this is one of the worst I've ever seen."
1.0,tangerine_2015,An obscure view of the survival and life of the forgotten part of the LGBT community that some would like to sweep under the rug. Great story and surprisingly great performances by all.
0.0,tangerine_2015,This movie is absolutely awful. I have no idea why it got such high ratings. The dialogue is awful and the storyline is vacuous and uninteresting. There really is no character development that makes you actually care what happens to the people in this movie.
1.0,tangerine_2015,How did I not know about this film. I lived in the 90s around the corner from Santa Monica and highland it seemed so real
0.0,tangerine_2015,Another movie rated high only because the theme is based on gay people. Boring and anoying!
1.0,tangerine_2015,I found this film to be wildly entertaining and dramatic. The fact that this entire movie was shot on an iPhone 5S is incredible and now has made me a harsh critic against digital films. There's no reason to shoot a film on a 35mm for it to be good. Raw film > digital media.
1.0,tangerine_2015,"so well done I kept thinking it was all real. captivating, brilliant acting, loved the whole look of the movie. I was surprised it had such a strong story. Funny too."

0.0,logan_lucky,"This movie was absolutely horrible, it took way to long and had a simple plot, I fast forwarded through half of it because it was so bad, the acting was mediocre and the whole beauty pageant was cringe, and they had too much southern accent, it could have been more subtle."

0.0,logan_lucky,"I do not laugh more than 2 times, which was disappointing for a comedy. The characters did not come across as convinced which lead the film to become a little boring by the end. Nice twist though."
1.0,logan_lucky,"So 100% what kind of humor I was looking for and as advertised based on the previews. The characters will instantly be the stuff of legend, and they were each perfectly cast."

0.0,logan_lucky,This movie was one of the worst we've seen. It moved VERY slowly and was not funny nor entertaining. Dwight Yoakam was good as the Warden.

0.0,logan_lucky,Since it is almost Fall this will go good with all the other fodder that is available. Worst movie in decades I have seen. Does not have a climax or even a start to move up to a decent show. Very funny in parts but not worth wasting your time with.
1.0,logan_lucky,This movie reminded me of Raising Arizona. A delightful comedy that was heartwarming and clever. So many good characters and plot kept escalating until the end.

0.0,logan_lucky,Oof. What a waste of Channing Tatums comedic ability!
0.0,logan_lucky,Felt like it was three hours long. Everything most people dislike about America all rolled into one movie. Nothing particularly compelling about the story or any of the characters. I might have enjoyed it more if I were to fast-forward it on a small airplane screen.
0.0,logan_lucky,"A whole lot of talent involved with this film, but I think everyone involved forgot their brains, including the critics reviewing it. The John Denver song in the opening was nice. After that, hell."

0.0,logan_lucky,"Terrible movie. I don't understand how professional critics like this thing. It was slow, unbelievable and not funny. The acting was a joke (see Seth McFarlane). Also was that DeNiro driving the garbage truck at the end? Please don't waste your money."

1.0,logan_lucky,"A fun, smart, and energetic movie is a great movie to nearly end the summer movie season, and is a great return from Steven Soderbergh"
0.0,logan_lucky,This is a horrible horrible movie. And to call it a movie is a stretch. A comedy with no jokes. It meanders and takes too long to tell the horrible story they pass off as a plot. Is it making fun of the south? Celebrating the south? Avoid Redneck Ocean's 11.
1.0,logan_lucky,Really a fun film. Daniel Craig is great and funny.
1.0,logan_lucky,Excellent! It's always fun to see a good comedy that does not take itself too seriously!

1.0,silver_linings_playbook,A modern day screwball comedy by way of 21st century sense of psychology. A brilliant cast down to the bit parts. Lawrence is a revelation. De Niro gives his best performance since HEAT and perhaps the most against type part he has ever played.

1.0,silver_linings_playbook,"David o Russell handles risky material. The kind of material that unless handled correctly, it could be either a complete failure or success. But with the controlled characters, amazing acting, and constant laughs, the result is Mr. Russell's magnum-opus."
1.0,silver_linings_playbook,Hilarious. Quirky. Extremely well written. Cooper and Lawrence continue to show that their success is not a fluke. You could complain that it is predictable but it's so much fun getting there that it doesnt matter.
0.0,silver_linings_playbook,"Awful. Just awful. The characters make no sense: their motivations, their actions. It made me cringe to watch. The most painful part to watch is how these messed up people have no insight at all into their problems. There is no reason to watch this, ever."

1.0,silver_linings_playbook,Too good of a performance from both Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence made me go insane and stressed out while watching them shouting at each other with fervor.

1.0,silver_linings_playbook,"My favorite film. It's a tragicomedy rooted in a dysfunctional family where instability is one of the only constants. It's a rom-com that achieves both depth and beauty. It's everything a movie should be, but so rarely is."

1.0,silver_linings_playbook,"Absolutely cracking little movie. Quirky, funny and touching. Bradley Cooper shows he can actually act and Jennifer Lawrence is smashing.Add a little DeNiro in a real role and not devaluing his immense value in 'Focker' movies and it becomes a 'must see' movie!"

1.0,dolce_vita,"Mastroianni es genial. Fellini relata la historia (sin historia) de la vida, la ""pasión de la vida"". La belleza inalcanzable de Sylvia, la inocencia inalcanzable de Paola. El vacío del mundo modernos; la esperanza del calor familar de Steiner."
0.0,dolce_vita,Not a fan of this Fellini movie. Didn't care about any of it.
1.0,dolce_vita,"A delicious, European treat, suffused with melancholy, beauty, and complexity."
1.0,dolce_vita,"Much like its contemporary, L'Avventura, La Dolve Vita perfectly captures the ennui and amoral listlessness of the idle rich. Fellini is captivating at his best."
1.0,dolce_vita,"It feels immense, but at the end of the day this is simply about a scared and insecure man's efforts to project false confidence. He keeps his eyes locked on what he believes will satisfy him, only to find that all paths have trials."
0.0,dolce_vita,The most pretentious movie I have ever seen in my life.
1.0,dolce_vita,"A pretty grim and oddly surreal look at the emptiness of wealth and hedonism. Fellini is great as usual here, and I can't help feeling it is a major influence on one of my favorite films, The Great Beauty."
1.0,dolce_vita,A crítica de Fellini ao modo de viver da burguesia italiana no pós-Guerra é duro e claro. E as inovações narrativas só se enriquecem com a fotografia e os figurinos espetaculares.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Fellini brings you to a place which is physically impossible, and he creates this with characters you either love or hate, but you feel from them. The most fun I have ever had in one film in my entire life"

1.0,dolce_vita,"Cada fotograma en esta pelicula es perfecto, es una maravilla, empezando por la escena inicial del Cristo trasladÃ ndose por un helicÃ²ptero, Anita Ekberg en la fuente de Trevi, para verla mÃ s de una vez.Excelente banda sonora."
1.0,dolce_vita,"La Dolce Vita was filmed with style and energy, presented on an epic scale, and it is as fascinating and astonishing a cinematic milestone as ever."
1.0,dolce_vita,Roger Ebert's favourite movie of all time - the Italian master Fellini's finest - and a classic which must surely be seen by so much more.

0.0,dolce_vita,"Turns out, I'm just not at all into Fellini. Let the cries of heresy ensue."

1.0,dolce_vita,La dolce vita [1960]
1.0,dolce_vita,Here is a remarkable creation. I have never come away from a movie feeling so simultaneously fulfilled yet empty. It refracts then reflects the viewers' emotional extremes back onto them in ever-changing ways.
1.0,dolce_vita,"La Dolce Vita portrays blissful ignorance as the truth of tragedy. Elegant and suggestive cinematography, some of Fellini's greatest ideas, and a length not ever overblown or tiresome. La Dolce Vita is definitely an Italian masterpiece."

1.0,dolce_vita,I've seen somewhere between six & eight thousand movies in my life and yet I only saw this masterpiece for the first time last night. There's probably an easy few hundred classic movies that people would be shocked to learn that I haven't seen. At least this is no longer one of them.

1.0,dolce_vita,So old and stylistically so cute with fascinating character showing us that time Italy. Marcello Mastroianni and Anouk Aimee are superstars!
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini's most famous film is also in some respects his most extravagant and condemning. Beautifully shot and filled with unforgettable scenes.

1.0,dolce_vita,Una gran obra de arte!
1.0,dolce_vita,so unbelievably cool
1.0,dolce_vita,felinibest movie ever
1.0,dolce_vita,"Can't believe I went this long without seeing it, but there are a few I still haven't seen. It pretty much speaks for itself, but I'm left with the question that if the paparazzi world was this decadent in the 60s, what would Fellini make of it today?"
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini's masterful and stunning portrayal of Italian neo-realism is among his best work. No-one can pull off the classic fountain scene like Anita Ekberg.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Beautiful portrait of decadent disillusionment. Endlessly gratifying visuals, and great performances by all. Touching, sad, heartbreaking, yet exciting, and deeply satisfying, if cynical. Fellini's visions of humanity, and the intricate glories of Rome, and Nico. A great big slice of story."
1.0,dolce_vita,Marcello Mastroianni is my new old movie star crush.
1.0,dolce_vita,One of the best movies ever- period!
1.0,dolce_vita,A must see for any film aficionado!!
1.0,dolce_vita,This movie is the reason i would love to visit Rome someday
1.0,dolce_vita,The most realistically debauched film ever
1.0,dolce_vita,"I have no idea what this film is about, the symbolism of the sea monster in the ending, the g-rated orgy. Maybe it documents the emergence of the paparazzi or the decline of western civilization. The absurd, the absurd. Very postmodern Rome, Very Fellini."
1.0,dolce_vita,"I don't know how to praise it. Each and every part was delightful. My heart- if there is any- watched it, not me."
1.0,dolce_vita,can you believe there are only 12 flixster reviews of this movie?
1.0,dolce_vita,"A more miserable life is better, believe me, than an existence protected by an organized society where everything is calculated, everything is perfect."
1.0,dolce_vita,"Pure Fellini absurdism. The way it was chalked up I was expecting more of the gorgeous Anita Ekberg, but Mastroianni is very magnetic in the film. I was shocked by how beautiful this film was (add another point to bw being more beautiful than color)."
1.0,dolce_vita,Amazing. Everything about this film is right. I love the sense of endless chase. I'm depressed I'll never again get to watch this movie for the first time.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Could be my favorite Fellini. This film is flawless. The story is superb, the details are mind-blowing. It's utterly fantastic. A philosopher's film, for sure."
1.0,dolce_vita,ClÃ¡ssico inconteste de Fellini. Brilhante a atuaÃ§Ã£o de Marcello Mastroiani. Apaixonante do inÃ­cio ao fim.
1.0,dolce_vita,A film that very likely I would see many many times. Beautiful.
1.0,dolce_vita,saw it again: WHAT A MOVIE - I need to revisit other Fellini-movies also - but why was it banned in Spain until 1983?
0.0,dolce_vita,So long. Full of Italian-speak. Surreal imagry that I couldn't figure out. I gave up 2 hours into it. Sorry Fellini. I'd rather take 8 1/2.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Large, satisfying, mysterious."
0.0,dolce_vita,Technically a very good film but far too tedious for me
1.0,dolce_vita,This movie exhibits the manifestation of decadence. It is both quiet and powerful; Fellini's best.
1.0,dolce_vita,"As I had said about Persona, this is one of the few films which I think is perfect. After watching this, I felt like I had just experienced life, hence the title of the movie. The cinematography is enchanting, the acting was as well, and everything about this film was perfect."

1.0,dolce_vita,"Not for everyone as it is largely plotless, but nonethless it is both mesmirising and memorable. Deserves its classic status."
1.0,dolce_vita,It's like researching for an enormous pile of encyclopedic matters and you conclude on stabilizing weirdness as a norm.And to think paparazzi was made up as a word thanks to this film...
1.0,dolce_vita,"One of my favorites to watch in a dark, quiet room at night...with all of the concentration of a chocolate-buzzed lounging session..."
1.0,dolce_vita,This is a classic and one of the best films made......................
1.0,dolce_vita,"""La Dolce Vita"" e agrodolce."
1.0,dolce_vita,"Fellini was the greatest filmmaker who ever lived. I know that's subjective, but I don't care what anyone else says. If I could never watch another movie but one, it would be this."
1.0,dolce_vita,this movie both colorful and white-black for me.. i love character analyses of FeFe..
1.0,dolce_vita,i thought it was wonderful.
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini is a genius. All eight sequences in this movie stand on their own. The idea that modernism will change man is a fascinating one. This movie seriously changed the way I view movies.
1.0,dolce_vita,It makes it's point so well and so often(too much of a good thing is a bad thing; the disillusionment that comes with excessive decadence.)that it nearly folds over on itself and becomes an example of it's own meaning.
1.0,dolce_vita,"I absolutely love Fellini: Italy, pagentry, blasphemy, sexuality on a grand scale. He is absolutely brilliant and never fails to amuse me. Nino Rotta and the accompanying music is amazing!"
1.0,dolce_vita,"life is excess and excess will eat at your core. fast city living will make you lose your umbrian angel, especially if your prone to the wife/mother/whore syndrome. ain't fellini great?!"
1.0,dolce_vita,"Have a few drinks, sit down and enjoy."
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini's masterpiece paved the way for movies like Lost in Translation by trading typical narrative structure for everyday examination.
1.0,dolce_vita,"This is the first Fellini film I ever saw, and at the time I found it truly astonishing. For me, it was a great introduction to Fellini's world and made me want to see explore his other films. I see it as a sublime European pop epic that needs to be viewed again and again..."
1.0,dolce_vita,"Simply the most amazing movie ever. It will haunt you for the rest of your life. But then, I give myself away..."
1.0,dolce_vita,"not as good as 8 1/2, but the fountain scene is one of my favorite scene of all time"
1.0,dolce_vita,that's innovative cinema! way ahead of its tme. the music score is one oth the best of all times. And Anita Ekberg is definately one of the sexiest women on screen ever!
1.0,dolce_vita,"i liked this more than eight and a half. i don't think it is as daring or visually stimulating, but i had a much better time taking it in. it's three hours of chaos but the scenes are short and clever. and unline the other fellini film i feel like this one had more of a pulse."
1.0,dolce_vita,anything with marcello....sigh
1.0,dolce_vita,Marcello .... mmm...Italian...mmm...Anita ...mmm
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini at his best.
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini...need I say more?
1.0,dolce_vita,Images from this movie never quite leave me. Leave it to Fellini to break the narrative format and create something this incredible. It's the first true character piece but with an epic scope of rome. Fellini could say so much with so little. Gets better every time I see it.
1.0,dolce_vita,"This movie is one of my favorites. The movie was just great, I first saw it in my Italian Cinema class and was completely blown away. Great film."
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini's second best surreal masterpiece
1.0,dolce_vita,"God this movie is great. Fillini's cinema is so expansive and wild, yet the transitions are effortless."

1.0,dolce_vita,These are the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen!... The eyes of the squid...
1.0,dolce_vita,"A masterpiece. A film that can be seen on so many levels it becomes more like a canvas than a film. Classic and endlessly re-watchable, La Dolce Vita (The Sweet Life) is among the greatest achievements in cinema."
1.0,dolce_vita,"Beautiful performances and gorgeous actors and actresses. Makes you wonder how different and yet similar societies can be across countries and along decades. Bravo Fellini, Bravo!!"
1.0,dolce_vita,"The paparazzi are a bunch of heartless fuckers. Another terribly depressing, terribly brilliant piece from Fellini."
1.0,dolce_vita,"Depressing and haunting, it showcases the perils of a life lead in lust. This movie bites hard, and draws blood."
1.0,dolce_vita,Such a beautiful movie and a wonderful story about trying to find yourself.
1.0,dolce_vita,fellini's masterpiece on the silly accolades we bestow on celebrities
1.0,dolce_vita,Revolutionary -- Fucking fantastic!
1.0,dolce_vita,"Imagenes que quedaran grabadas para siempre en su memoria, una actuacion insuperable a cargo de Marcello Mastroinanni, una cinta construida de manera minuciosa como un exquisito trabajo de relojeria. No hay nada malo en La Dolce Vita."
1.0,dolce_vita,It's funny how this is more relevant today than ever before. You can't doubt the power of Fellini's vision here.
1.0,dolce_vita,"A cinematographic feast in rich, elegant black-and-white. The musical scenes are exquisite. Yvonne Furneaux's eyes almost leap out of the screen. Anita Ekberg makes me think.... Aprhodite."
1.0,dolce_vita,"I would like to be la dolce vita's fly on the roman wall and, maybe, more..."
1.0,dolce_vita,One of the greatest films of ever!
1.0,dolce_vita,quem nao se apaixona pela anita ekberg tomando banho na fontana de trevi tem MUITO do que aprender na vida.

1.0,dolce_vita,One of Fellini's best...
1.0,dolce_vita,"the languid, sometimes frantic, search for enchantment in the minefield of corruption."
0.0,dolce_vita,"On baille et on s'ennuie avec ce film : pas de dialogue poignant, pas d'effets speciaux, pas de gros calibres,... Fellini aurait du reviser ses classiques americains."
0.0,dolce_vita,"Boring, boring, BO-ring!"
0.0,dolce_vita,"Overated and overlong, it is typically Fellini. Saved only from utter mediocrity by the incredible Marcello Mastroianni and THAT scene with Anita Ekberg, a woman who makes the phrase ""sex-bomb"" seem nuclear powered."
1.0,dolce_vita,"a fellini masterpiece on the personas we create for celebrities, the americanization of europe in the sixties, and so on."
1.0,dolce_vita,second only to 8 1/2
1.0,dolce_vita,only for a select few
1.0,dolce_vita,"whenever I am down, i always think about this movie. It shows that not even in film you get everything you want. Some time we as humans expect everything to come so easily but in reality that doesn't always happens. Fellini is such a master and I will always look up to him."
1.0,dolce_vita,"Anita Ekberg, Marcello, Fellinin, need I say more?"
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini's Masterpiece
1.0,dolce_vita,"Huipputyylikas elokuva, josta loytaa joka katsomiskerralla uutta. Ja se oinen Rooma..."

1.0,dolce_vita,A great film from the Director-Actor duo Fellini and Mastroianni. Must watch for any serious student of cinema.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Always felt like a bad film buff for having never seen this one. Seen a lot of Fellini, but somehow always managed to skip passed this one.How do you not fall in love with this film? I don't know."
1.0,dolce_vita,The party scene where Anouk Aimee sits Snaporaz down in the lonely room and talks to him via vents...Dat scene is pretty much OFF DA HOOK.
1.0,dolce_vita,Amazingly ahead of its time--it's hard to believe this was shot in 1959. Still shocking and beautiful (and long).
1.0,dolce_vita,"After watching it twice, and fully understanding it...i can safely say, 5 stars x"
1.0,dolce_vita,My first Fellini Movie and one of my top faves.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Yes the film is long, but Fellini is not one of the world's greatest directors for nothing. Love the edgy style, the incredible b/w cinemography. Its one the great classics, a must see."
1.0,dolce_vita,"A brilliant, haunting, and unique. An amazing Fellini film that I saw when I was younger and really want to watch again."
1.0,dolce_vita,I absolutely love this movie!
1.0,dolce_vita,"A masterpeice. Definetly edgey for 1960. I liked how the story was told by following Marcello from scene to scene rather than a flat, run-of-the-mill story. A great cornerstone for the filmmaking world."
1.0,dolce_vita,Masterpiece 50 years old still 50 years ahead of its time
1.0,dolce_vita,"A classic masterpiece! Almost half a century on, it is still so relevant! The easy-going lifestyle of urban young elite, without any depth in relationships, looking for some extra fun, but the morning light brings only dissappointment..."
1.0,dolce_vita,"very impressive, makes you think about lots of things"
1.0,dolce_vita,"I really find amazing how the characters of Dolce Vita are never ready to make a full decision on something. At the same time, their efforts for communication are always uncomplete. Aren't these describe our life, with many opportunites, the next moment leaving us with a bitter sense... Oh Rome!"
1.0,dolce_vita,"This is quite likely my favorite film, period."
1.0,dolce_vita,best fellini!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,dolce_vita,"A Fellini masterpiece. Exuberant and exhilarating. It was both scandalous and thrilling. A smorgasborg of themes reach dizzying heights in this decadent epic dealing with celebrities, paparrazi and debauchery."
1.0,dolce_vita,The best movie of all the times.. Not enough stars to rate this movie
1.0,dolce_vita,"If I had to live in a movie, it would be this one....I know. What does that make me?"
1.0,dolce_vita,Absolutely one of the finest films ever made...
0.0,dolce_vita,"Interesting few film tricks, but mostly long, boring, about nothing, don't bother."
1.0,dolce_vita,This movie left me kind of numb at the end. Almost too much to absorb at once. I love the scene where the balloons follow the clown out of the room. This is a movie I could watch repeatedly and probably never understand fully.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Cynically beautiful, beautifully cynical."
1.0,dolce_vita,"A powerhouse of dialogue, music, humor, sex, and cinematography into one of the most sensual surrealist film. One of the All-Time Best."
1.0,dolce_vita,I can completely relate to Marcello.
1.0,dolce_vita,A mith. Marcello is too sensitive for not recognizing the corruption around him and too smart for not being attracted
1.0,dolce_vita,"The best director from the history made this one for everybody realize that the world is crazy. Marcello Mastroianni in an historica char, a legend scene with Anita Ekber. If shock me in these days, I can Imagine in 50 years ago...."
0.0,dolce_vita,I can never pay attention during this movie. And the presence of Nico just annoys the hell out of me. Not my favorite Fellini.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Stylish, iconic film."
1.0,dolce_vita,I can't really say anything that hasn't been said before. A spot on piece of world cinema directed by a great master.
1.0,dolce_vita,"One of the best movies, but slow and complex. It shares many of the problems we face today with the views of the Italian High society of the 50's. It is a treatise on sociology."
1.0,dolce_vita,Self-loathing has never been so beautiful.
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini's dark side deeply explored. Most people cannot watch this movie. It holds nothing back on the meaninglessness of life. It haunts and haunts you.

1.0,dolce_vita,"A miracle of a movie. I won't belittle it by saying more. A film one simply must see (but wait til you are at the age when you start having doubts about the true meaning of life before doing so- even though the film, perhaps rightfully, gives no answer, it will surely feed your own questionings)."
1.0,dolce_vita,"This is exactly the sort of film cinema was invented for, only wish I had seen it years ago..."
1.0,dolce_vita,Seductive and evocative... Its beautiful. I loved this film.

1.0,dolce_vita,"This is my FAVORITE film! So compelling, a visual and emotional feast. Bravo Fellini!"

1.0,dolce_vita,"MI FAVORITA DE FELLINI. QUIZA LA MAS DESOLADORA. LA DECADENCIA DEL ULTIMO TERCIO, SOBRE TODO EN LA FIESTA, ES ALGO CON LO QUE LAMENTABLEMENTE UNO NO PUEDE DEJAR DE EMPATIZAR."
1.0,dolce_vita,"This is one of my favorite movies and my favorite Fellini flick. Its themes still apply to society 100% today and even more so in America than almost 50 years ago in Italy. Marcello's inner conflicts to me are some of the most interesting ever explored on film. Also, Antia Ekberg is beyond amazing"
1.0,dolce_vita,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini is a genius and Marcello Mastroianni could be the coolest man to ever walk the earth
1.0,dolce_vita,nothing sexier than italian cinema than Mastriani in this film-
1.0,dolce_vita,"The best movie from Fellini. Although the story might seem to be tedious, we saw Fellini`s trasforming. His spirit was so connected with Marcello destructed and evaporated."
1.0,dolce_vita,"The most brilliant insight portrait of Italy, in Rome, at the end of the ""roaring '50s"", between gossip, celebrities, and fashion. A masterpiece wonderfully directed by Federico and interpreted by Marcello Mastroianni, his alter-ego on the screen!"
1.0,dolce_vita,"Fucking brilliant from beginning to end. And it's so beautiful, you might not notice that this film is really a condemnation of idolatry in the modern world."

1.0,dolce_vita,"A triumph of Italian cinema and one of Fellini's best. After watching it I became oddly attached to it, especially to Marcello."
1.0,dolce_vita,One of the best films ever made.
1.0,dolce_vita,Fucking brilliant. See it.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Boobs. Glorious, gigantic boobs. Redefined the boob film. Also, Marcello Mastroianni and the origin of the Paparazzi."
1.0,dolce_vita,This movie has it all and defines everything that was sexy and wonderful about Roma (and Italy) in the late 50s/early 60s.
1.0,dolce_vita,"OÃ¹ l'on se demande oÃ¹ peut bien aller JÃ©sus, qui passe dans le ciel..."

1.0,dolce_vita,"Lo mejor es esa fiesta media sordida-vip, media surrealista, media patetica, esta pelicula me da la sensacion de estar durmiendo, se parece mucho a los suenos q tengo. 50 anos y sigue haciendo sentido la decadencia y el glamour. Amo a Marcello, esta muuuy weno."
1.0,dolce_vita,I know that 8 1/2 is great but I'm still partial to La Dolce Vita. It's downright magical.
1.0,dolce_vita,May be my favorite film of all time.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Is this movie really 3 hours long? It positively whizzes by. And how can a black & white movie seem so colorful? Oh, and the Nino Rota score -- this one makes the Best of All Time list."
1.0,dolce_vita,It took me some time to trully appreciate how incredible this movie and how many memorable scenes it contains!! LOVE IT
1.0,dolce_vita,just about everything in this movie makes it worth watching... all its strong and weak points (in any opinion) make it unforgettable
1.0,dolce_vita,This is a wonderful film about the sweet life and how fucked up it makes people.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Don't complain about it being slow, it's done in neo-realist style. It's perfect, (Think of this as a great cup of coffee, and 8 1/2 will be your cigarette). And if you didn't leave the film feeling empty and lost, you didn't watch it correctly."
1.0,dolce_vita,Is it Rome? Is it Fellini? Is it Mastroianni (as a journalist)? Or is it simply Anita Ekberg in one of the most famous scenes in movie history?
1.0,dolce_vita,Great script and direction. Marcello is wonderful. Anita looks so sexy in this film. Very unusual and absorbing film.
1.0,dolce_vita,i want to have an espresso and swim in the treviso-fountain with this cool guy carrying me out of the water smoking an of course dry cigarette...
1.0,dolce_vita,"the characters, the black and white shots make this movie unforgettable."
1.0,dolce_vita,"This tremendous movie, full of noise and spectacle, is a well thought-out utterance which provokes very serious thought. The movie I most want to watch again and again until I understand everything. Plus, Ekberg. Oh, and Marcello."
1.0,dolce_vita,An amazing Fellini film.
1.0,dolce_vita,Wonderful. Mesmerizing. A Classic and an iconic film. It deserves it.
1.0,dolce_vita,"you can always enjoy good music, food and girls...make sure you have at least one good suit!"
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini is probably a man with an eye in the future 50 years before...
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini is so awesome that he's been turned into an adjective (much like Steven Segal). He's not all whimsical and surreal. This message of the movie is pretty grim. We're all fucked. In Italian. With Fountains and cleavage. See it!
1.0,dolce_vita,Perhaps the greatest film ever made
1.0,dolce_vita,What stikes me about this movie is that is amazingly up to date...
1.0,dolce_vita,"Fontana di trevi, know who doesn't wanna swim there??"
1.0,dolce_vita,apperently recreating the fountain is illegal-who would have guessed?
1.0,dolce_vita,There aren't enough adjectives to describe this film. Bravo!
1.0,dolce_vita,NO NEED TO SAY AGAIN.... ROME ROME ROME!!!!!
1.0,dolce_vita,see it on the big screen if you can is all I can say. It's the most lively tragic film ever to come from Italy; Fellini could have only topped himself with 8 1/2. Those who can't stand the papparazzi would do well to see the coining of the term here with a character named Papparazzo
1.0,dolce_vita,One of the few very magical films. Recommended for all to see.
1.0,dolce_vita,"As in most of Fellini's films, you can't stop smiling and being sucked into the circus of his characters and their scenarios. Light never looked so good."
1.0,dolce_vita,"Very surreal movie watching experience. It's like an amazing party that goes on for way too long -- you're tired, you want to go home, but you can't shake the feeling that you'll remember the night for the rest of your life."
1.0,dolce_vita,Great Flick. Very haunting and unreal feeling. Especially Mastrioni's lonely et confident expressions. I love this one.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Enfin réussi à le voir en entier en une seule fois. Film déroutant et passionnant, sa structure me plaît beaucoup, réalisation et interprétation sans faille."
1.0,dolce_vita,"Fellini is brilliant, always. This is one of his must see films. MUST SEE."
1.0,dolce_vita,perfect . need say no more -- real filmaking
1.0,dolce_vita,You canno't forget any of the marvellous scenes from this neo realistic expression of Italia....
1.0,dolce_vita,Anita Eckberg. Cloning was invented for just such occasions.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Great, Giant,,,masterpiece..."
1.0,dolce_vita,"Master Fellini at his best. The glamour of another era in the world and filmmaking is present in this masterpiece, showing the decadence of the elite in a superb way. Mastroiani and Anita Eckberg are one of the greatest couples in cinema's history. Brilliant."

1.0,the_bands_visit,"an outstanding movie... some subtitles , a movie about human beings , some Arab , some Jewish , people are just people no matter where they come from or going to, this is a film from Israel."
1.0,the_bands_visit,"Beautiful film about bonding and life. There is good humor, typical of many Middle East films, and some rather deep moments as well (the clarinetist is looking to finish his concerto and gets some beautiful insight from his host).  I love this movie and recommend it - lots to glean from its story."

1.0,the_bands_visit,"Just delightful. Wonderful portraits of dealing with uncertainty, attempts to retain pride and dignity, and the personal aspects of encounters of language and culture. A real gem."
1.0,the_bands_visit,"This movie was a total delight and deeply moving. Arab men can be cute and vulnerable. Set in Israeli suburbia, which seem as soul destroying as the oz burbs, 8 men get lost and then find themselves. See it."

1.0,the_bands_visit,A great movie showing the differences between Israelis and Egyptians in a ludicrous way.
1.0,the_bands_visit,"Cute, sentimental, soulful..great movie of 2008. He's got the Wes Anderson-like style which can be kind of slow, but adds a certain comedic effect and allows you to take the time to really get into it. I really liked it- a great movie."
1.0,the_bands_visit,"Nearly perfect...moody...sexy...humane...the only thing wrong with it is the final music performance that too quickly gets glommed over with end credits. but otherwise an optimistic companion piece to the best foreign fim of the last decade, ""the lives of others."""

1.0,before_midnight_2013,"It's easy to forget how thought-provoking and fresh these films are because Richard Linklater's direction is so elegant and modest, and Ethan Hawke and Julie Delphy's act with such believability, delivering strong intellectual perceptions on love, marriage, and lasting relationships."

1.0,annie_hall,"If you like (500) Days of Summer, then watch this. Also, if you hate (500) Days of Summer, REALLY watch this."
1.0,annie_hall,Neurotic jerk is the (not so) new sexy. One of my top 10 movies of all time.
1.0,annie_hall,"Not every love story works out in movies, but they can all come out perfectly baked by Woody Allen."
1.0,annie_hall,The story of the ups and downs of a relationship. You'll love it from the beggining to the end and everything in between it this is definitely Allens masterpiece.
1.0,annie_hall,"This film has a great storytelling style, and a realistic quality that some of Woody Allen's other films sometimes lack. The jokes are subtle but relentless and the interactions between characters are natural and wonderful to watch."
1.0,annie_hall,Wood Allen's best film.
1.0,annie_hall,Annie Hall is another Woody Allen classic that combines charm and humor with criticism while on a walk down memory lane. Woody Allen is surely one of the greatest film writers and his film could only really be seen as a masterful take on geographical romanticism; love pending on the city.
1.0,annie_hall,"Filled with Woody Allen's typically intelligent humor and charm, Annie Hall is an expertly acted romantic comedy that manages to be cynical and touching at the same time."
1.0,annie_hall,Definetly in my top 10 favorite movies of all time
1.0,annie_hall,One of my favorite films ever. I've seen this movies about 20 times and enjoyed it every time.
1.0,annie_hall,"Allen's masterpiece. And simultaneously the best, and most unorthodox Romantic Comedy ever made."
1.0,annie_hall,"The peak of Woody Allen's inventiveness and wit and his major artistic breakthrough. This is one of the greatest films ever made, simple as that. The film blends great comedy with poignant insight on the rhythms of relationships, arguably better than any other film."
1.0,annie_hall,"Easily Allen's best, Annie Hall is a triumph as both a serious and hilarious misadventure."
1.0,annie_hall,This movie is absolutely hilarious
1.0,annie_hall,one of the best movie I ever seen. This remains an American classic and Woody Allen best film.
1.0,annie_hall,"What a pleasure to watch, an excellent film, timeless."
1.0,annie_hall,"Still Woody Allen's best. Groundbreaking, memorable, consistently enjoyable and even manages to constantly feel real, even when breaking the forth wall to remind us we're watching a movie or slipping into an animated aside featuring the Evil Queen from Snow White."
1.0,annie_hall,An excellent introduction to Woody Allen.
0.0,annie_hall,"Pretentious tale of failed love, culminating in the dispensation of rotten advice about life and love from the perspective of someone who has never enjoyed either."
1.0,annie_hall,Haven't seen this in a long time.
1.0,annie_hall,"A funny, charming, and personal story."
1.0,annie_hall,"An all-time favourite. Too much to say, but I'll leave it there. Just see it."
1.0,annie_hall,A true classic by Woody Allen.
1.0,annie_hall,One of the few that provide increasing enjoyment with every viewing. Woody is a neurotic and lovestruck artist in his prime. I can't imagine the joy of experiencing this film during the era of its release.
1.0,annie_hall,"Perhaps Allen's greatest achievement, Annie Hall is a delightful and heartbreaking journey through the soaring highs and tragic depths of love, the chemistry between Keaton and Allen never once faltering in its effortlessness and charm."
1.0,annie_hall,Woody Allen's Annie Hall is quite simply the best romantic comedy ever made.
1.0,annie_hall,A meta rom-com ahead of its time. Witty and smart dialog coupled with chemistry between Allen and Keaton gives hope to the genre that has been lost in needless conventions. Woody Allen's masterpiece of humor and creative storytelling.
1.0,annie_hall,Neurotic New York comedian Alvy Singer falls in love with the ditsy Annie Hall.
1.0,annie_hall,"I felt as if i needed to write my thoughts in depth about this movie. I think that this movie is just brilliant, Woody Allen's neurotic performance is perfect and Diane Keaton just adds so much energy and life to the screen. I have to say this is without a doubt Woody Allen's best movie!"
1.0,annie_hall,Both Keaton and Allen's finest achievements to date.
1.0,annie_hall,My approbation is unnecessary to justify the viewing of this contemporary classic.
1.0,annie_hall,"EngraÃ§ado, inteligente, pensante, ciente, romÃ¢ntico, incrÃ­vel, clÃ¡ssico."
1.0,annie_hall,We all need the eggs.. :)
1.0,annie_hall,"Annie Hall signifies a tour de force for Woody Allen and American classic, packed with touching acting and irresistible laughs."
1.0,annie_hall,The true essence of Woody Allen's mind. The movie somehow after 35 years has managed to stay fresh.
1.0,annie_hall,Um dos melhores q ja vi!
1.0,annie_hall,A heartwarming comedic romance with that awesome touch of Woody Allen. He takes this movie to the heights. Breaking the forth wall in the Movie theater scene. To Christopher Walken's famous scene.
1.0,annie_hall,"You know you have an amazing movie when Christopher Walken isn't the best thing about it.""I never spent time with my granny, she was too busy getting raped by cossacks"""
1.0,annie_hall,Annie Hall is hilarious and well-written with fantastic performances by Woody Allen and Diane Keaton.
1.0,annie_hall,"It's funny, and Keaton has a cute performance. It's Allen's Alvy Singer that degrades the film: he may be witty, but he was a bad boyfriend."
1.0,annie_hall,"It's one of my favorite films ever, so I'm a little biased."
1.0,annie_hall,"One of the best movies I think I've ever seen, so genuine and real, yet incredibly humorous at the same time."
1.0,annie_hall,"Other then serving as a realistic portrayal of a messy relationship, Annie Hall was also groundbreaking in it's direction and features the best dialogue of any Woody Allen film. A true classic to say the least."
1.0,annie_hall,How this beat Star Wars for best picture I'll never know.
1.0,annie_hall,"the funniest, truest and most beautifully written film ever made."
1.0,annie_hall,Its my favourite rom com of all time. Watched again on Bluray and stand by this only gets better on repeated viewings. To call this film a rom-com even feels insulting.
1.0,annie_hall,"I honestly gotta say, that this is the funniest film I have ever seen."
1.0,annie_hall,"There's a reason why this is everyone's favorite Woody Allen movie. Here he transcends above his purely comedic niche; the humor in Annie Hall, although never missing a beat, is merely a backdrop for the meaningful exploration of love and human relationships."
1.0,annie_hall,Woody Allen's best film.
1.0,annie_hall,Good jokes and a magnificent script. Maybe the best Woody Allen's work.
1.0,annie_hall,The greatest romantic comedy of all time.

1.0,annie_hall,This is just as good as Aubrey Plaza.Probably the best comedy ever made.
1.0,annie_hall,If only Woody Allen still made films like this.
1.0,annie_hall,One of the funniest movies I have ever seen! It's the original 500 Days of Summer!

1.0,annie_hall,Re-watched recently after watching for the first time 7-8 years ago and I was just BLOWN AWAY at how funny and heartwarming this film is. One of the best!
1.0,annie_hall,A groundbreaking comedy. Achieves a difficult balance of silliness and pretension.
1.0,annie_hall,"Really great, swift, fast-paced, entertaining, brilliantly acted. Woody Allen's neurotic ramblings don't get in the way of a great, honest story."
1.0,annie_hall,Seminal film. Adored and watched over and over from childhood to now.
1.0,annie_hall,"Well deserving of its oscar win, Annie Hall combines all the elements of a good comedy with great performances and terrific script by Woody Allen. It can be arguably the best Woody Allen film."
1.0,annie_hall,Bittersweet slice of '70s dysfunctional love. Even closer now in this day of relationship turmoil. Always awash with a glimmer of hope
1.0,annie_hall,A fresh movie.Great story.A MUST SEE.
1.0,annie_hall,One of the greatest movies I've ever seen.
1.0,annie_hall,THAT MOVIE MADE ME SAD AT THE END
1.0,annie_hall,"Alvy Singer's self constructed quandaries of himself, his lovers, fellow New Yorkers and the world are intimately shared with the audience and random passerby's on the street...it's the crème de la crème of cerebral comedies and Woody Allen is a dialogue virtuoso and the king of anxiety."
1.0,annie_hall,An American classic.
1.0,annie_hall,So much fun to watch.
1.0,annie_hall,"Truly the funniest and most poignant film above love and relationships, and the crazy lapse of a heartbroken mind trying to put the pieces back together. Every romantic comedy worth a damn, including ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""500 Days of Summer"" would not be around if not for this."
1.0,annie_hall,Another Woody Allen great

1.0,annie_hall,"A brilliantly written, acted, and directed love story. Pure genius."
1.0,annie_hall,"One of Allen's finest, cute, charming and astonishingly honest a must watch if you are a fan of the biggest hipster in cinema."

1.0,annie_hall,Wonderfully inspiring.

1.0,annie_hall,One of my favorite films of all time. <3
1.0,annie_hall,"Woody Allen isn't traditionally funny, but he was hilarious in this amazing romantic comedy. In addition, Diane Keaton played Annie Hall very well and the story itself was wonderful and much better than the majority of romantic comedy plots."

1.0,annie_hall,"Of course, Annie Hall is Woody Allen's satire masterpiece. Allen and Keaton have great chemistry that results in a marvelous, contending and sweet picture."
1.0,annie_hall,Must See! A nervous romance.

1.0,annie_hall,A great comedy from a comedy genius. Great performances and a great screenplay.
1.0,annie_hall,"A thoroughly enjoyable film which could easily be classified as ""romantic comedy"" even though the very sound of that seems to cheapen the groundbreaking, heartfelt quality it exudes. Timeless and beautiful and nearly faultless."
1.0,annie_hall,"Allen's best ever. It's charming drama and probably the smartest of Allen works. With social issue and memorable funny romantic script, just simply the best. Pure entertainment of this century!!"
1.0,annie_hall,The quintessential Woody Allen masterpiece.

1.0,annie_hall,The best romantic comedy ever made.

1.0,annie_hall,"Woody Allen's best, in what might be the beginning of serious Woody. So much truth about relationships, and still very funny."
1.0,annie_hall,"Woody Allen at his most neurotic, witty and wry."

1.0,annie_hall,Perfect movie for today.
1.0,annie_hall,Loved it. Perhaps a film to appreciate at a certain point in your life. I can imagine not empathising with it's themes as much when I was younger.
1.0,annie_hall,BRILLIANTLY WRITTEN!
1.0,annie_hall,Woody Allen's best. The greatest romance of all time.
1.0,annie_hall,Because I need the eggs.
1.0,annie_hall,"Oh what the hell, I never left a review? Saw a few clips tonight on an old Siskel & Ebert show about Woody Allen and Mel Brooks, was reminded this is truly one of the best movies I've ever seen. Absolutely brilliant."
1.0,annie_hall,"Alvy Singer: ""You know, I - I feel that life is - is divided up into the horrible and the miserable. Those are the two categories, you know."" My kind of guy! Absolutely brilliant comedy by Woody Allen, with the wittiest dialogue of any film in history."
1.0,annie_hall,I love everything about this film. I'm a big Woody Allen fan. I identify well with his sense of humor. So clearly I'd be in love with his masterpiece.
1.0,annie_hall,Again. Watch it and love it.
1.0,annie_hall,The way Woody Allen potrays this love story is genius. He gives a strong comedic performance and some clever scences (Especially the one where Annie and Alvy have a conversation while their thoughts are subtitled) which make this a timeless classic.
1.0,annie_hall,Loved it! Woody at his best.
1.0,annie_hall,Woody Allen's Masterpiece
1.0,annie_hall,"Very well made film; Definatly Allen's greatest work with much witty comedy and a great pllot that is easy, and fun, to follow. Not a movie you leave feeling disappointed by the build up."
1.0,annie_hall,This movie completely sucked. Woody Allen strikes out again with this crapshoot. He should stick to just acting or directing; he tries to do it all and can barely do either. I would have rather played with a large vibrating egg myself than watch this.
1.0,annie_hall,"The most perfect movie to ever exist. A beyond honest love story and exploration and exploitation of the human condition in love. Beautifully sharp, charming, and performed flawlessly by all players."
1.0,annie_hall,i can see why this beat out star wars for best picture...
1.0,annie_hall,"Sets the bar impossibly high for how good a rom-com should be, and what it ever could be. Such unique, brilliant, and delightful storytelling. I can see why it won Best Picture in '77 over Star Wars, still can't say I agree with the decision although :P"
1.0,annie_hall,Woody Allen movie that originally Annie was a secondary character. With rewrites Annie became more central to the story. Diana Keaton & Woody Allan perfect couple.
1.0,annie_hall,Woody Allen`s first great film!
1.0,annie_hall,"This isn't just the best film from 1977. This is one of the best films on relationships ever made. If it weren't for ""Annie Hall"", there would be no Seinfeld, arguably. Woody Allen's best work, and that's saying a lot."
1.0,annie_hall,"""Don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love."""
1.0,annie_hall,"This is what romantic comedies USED to be, and what they were at their best: Funny, Sweet, and Romantic."
1.0,annie_hall,a very interesting movie.
0.0,annie_hall,I have no clue how this movie beat out Star Wars for an Oscar. It was so D-U-L-L!
1.0,annie_hall,I have watched this movie over and over its such a great film.
1.0,annie_hall,"Theaters were packed--the movie is a laugh riot--and everybody was falling in love with Diane Keaton. She was completely disarming and funny and unforgettable. (Later, she was on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine and the caption read: ""The next Hepburn."") Very recommended!"
1.0,annie_hall,it's Woody 101. seems fairly simple compared to his later films... but it's impossible to deny its appeal. nothing explains him better than this.
1.0,annie_hall,Best Romantic Comedy ever.
1.0,annie_hall,Movies like this remind you why Woody Allen is the genius he is. It's a shame he hasn't kept it up for some time now.
1.0,annie_hall,My favorite film ever!
1.0,annie_hall,"Either the saddest funny movie ever, or the funniest sad movie ever. Either way, Five Stars."

1.0,annie_hall,"Melhor filme do Allen, melhor comédia romântica ever, e um dos melhores filmes da história do cinema."
1.0,annie_hall,What can I say about this? The perennial modern relationship movie.
1.0,annie_hall,Nunca entraría a un club en el que estuviera alguien como yo.
1.0,annie_hall,"Personal as the story he is telling may be, what separates this film from Allen's own past work and most other recent comedy is its general believability."

0.0,annie_hall,I'm Not a fan of Woody's films. WAY over rated!!
1.0,annie_hall,Annie Hall is quite funny and interesting. I enjoyed it all the way trough.

1.0,annie_hall,"One of the best movies ever created, period."
1.0,annie_hall,Not sure how to put it into words... Funny and exactly how love and life is.....
1.0,annie_hall,"As a kid I first appreciated Star Wars before I appreciated Woody Allen, thus, upon first seeing Annie Hall snagging the Oscar over A New Hope I was devastated. However, now, I'm not so upset."
1.0,annie_hall,"The turning point of Woody Allen's career, this is still arguably the greatest romantic comedy ever made. Every romantic comedy should aspire to this!"
1.0,annie_hall,"Before I'd finally watched it, I flatly (snobbishly) regarded Annie Hall as ""that dumb comedy that robbed Star Wars of Best Picture."" And while part of me is still butt-hurt about it, I can honestly say it's an equally impressive film...."
1.0,annie_hall,"Twenty minutes into this movie, I fell in love with it. It has some of the smartest writing I've ever seen, but when I thought that it couldn't get possibly any better, Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum showed up. I was completely blown away!"
1.0,annie_hall,So many things put together in such a short movie.The best romantic and realistic love movie of all time.
1.0,annie_hall,"""-Creo que se le da tanta importancia al orgasmo para compensar las zonas vacías de la vida...-Quien dijo eso?-el marques de Sade.""Siempre hay dialogos y frases que te han reir a carcajadas con ese ingenio tan caracteristico de el pero sin duda es una de las mejores peliculas de Allen."
1.0,annie_hall,One of the best films ever made. Allen has never been able to top it.

1.0,annie_hall,To my facebook friends who are on the fence: It's an amazing movie. Watch it now.
1.0,annie_hall,"The only romantic comedy I actually like so far, it's probably because it's actually funny without all the cliches. Seems like Woody Allen just thought up a lot of different funny scenarios and then wrote this movie, you think it would be a mess but it turned out great."
1.0,annie_hall,I have seen this numerous times since it came out. I believe I saw it in the theater in Cape May. I go through my Woody Allen periods. This is superbly acted. I think I appreciate this movie even more as an adult than when I was younger as I stumble through trying to come to terms with who I am.
1.0,annie_hall,I think it's victory over Star Wars was entirely deserved. A masterpiece.
1.0,annie_hall,"Just about every movie or television show that I like reminds me of either ""Annie Hall"" or my favorite movie of all times ""Manhattan."""
1.0,annie_hall,"""É uma antiga piada: duas velhinhas em um hotel fazenda. Uma diz: 'A comida aqui é um horror'. A outra diz: 'Eu sei, porções minúsculas'. É assim que eu vejo a vida: cheia de solidão, miséria, sofrimento e tristeza, e acaba rápido demais""."
1.0,annie_hall,"Es una comedia romÃ¡ntica con un toque que jamÃ¡s habÃ­a visto. De hecho de seguro fue un referente para 500 of sumer (Â¿500 dÃ­as con ella? o Â¿500 de verano?). Abarca crÃ­ticas sociales acerca de las relaciones de pareja de una forma sin igual. Muy buena, tienen que verla."
1.0,annie_hall,"This is amazing. As entertaining and intelligent as you wish a film would be, Annie Hall is probably Woody Allen's most successfully executed film. It's every bit as good as people keep telling you. Watch it and fall in love with what is most certainly an essential film. Enjoy!"

1.0,city_lights,80+ years later this film still holds up. Chaplin was masterful at portraying his emotions. This is well worth searching for.
1.0,city_lights,One of the greatest and most charming cinematic experiences I've ever had. It moves with laughter and heart from start to finish. I don't see how anybody could not fall in love with this. The ending is one of the most touching moments in cinematic history. Chaplin's masterpiece.
1.0,city_lights,"A timeless comedy that is funny, inspirational and moving."
1.0,city_lights,"Ah, romance. Chaplin has once again proved his philosophical taste for society and class and romance and politics and... well, the list could go on for a while. City Lights is entertaining and hilarious and beefs its audiences with daring ideas."

1.0,city_lights,"Chaplin's Masterpiece!!! And believe me, that's much to say!!"
1.0,city_lights,"Despite some gaps in logic such as the cure, and the eccentric millionaire parts, this film contains the most tender romance in the history of film, and thus, rightly deserves its masterpiece status. It is Chaplin's crowning glory, and possibly the greatest ending in the history of film."
1.0,city_lights,"(SPOILER ALERT) This film gave me another definition of comedy: ""A misunderstanding blown way out of proportion"" -- this is evident when our beloved Tramp is mistaken for a burglar, even though his millionaire friend gave him one grand to give to his leading lady."
1.0,city_lights,"Falling in love with a blind flower girl and befriending a suicidal millionaire are just a few of the Tramp's antics in this fun Chaplin classic. Although the plot and resolution can seem a little far-fetched and ridiculous, I would argue this to be Charlie Chaplin's finest work."

1.0,city_lights,"Boasting some great comedic set pieces, City Lights merits its timelessness with its subjects of generosity and elegance, along with its agile interlacing of humour and tragedy."
1.0,city_lights,Anything Chaplin gets 5 stars from me always! We rely so heavily on dialogue in movies today and he could captivate and entertain audiences with just the comical and yet sympathetic character he created with his actions.
1.0,city_lights,"Genuine genius, Chaplin is a true artist."
1.0,city_lights,THE BEST .....AND THE SWEETEST LOVE STORY....
1.0,city_lights,A film has yet to be as charming as City Lights is to me. A film gem.
1.0,city_lights,"""Yes, I can see now."""
1.0,city_lights,The best Chaplin movie and the best ending
1.0,city_lights,A fantastic film where actions in the age of silent films truly speak louder than words. Chaplin and the minor cast members of his acts are wonderful and their comedic sense pitch perfect.

1.0,city_lights,"City Lights stands as one of Chaplin's finest accomplishments. Chaplin's physical hi-jinx are as brilliant as ever, but it's the love story with the blind flower girl that makes City Lights stand the test of time."
1.0,city_lights,"As it's the only silent film I've ever watched, liked and rememberd... I give it 5*"
1.0,city_lights,His final smile is priceless. Chaplin shows more romantic passion here than most other movies without the benefit of a single spoken word. Timeless.

1.0,city_lights,"Utterly beautiful, funny and touching."
1.0,city_lights,Again it comes in two layers - as in the Apartment - the comedic surface and deeply tragic undertone of poorness and social injustice. Some gags are just brilliant - the boxing scene blows my mind.
1.0,city_lights,"Nobody will ever be able to give so much magic to cinema like Chaplin,and City Lights is an undeniable proof of it!"
1.0,city_lights,"It's amazing that even though this movie is 80 yrs old this year, I still find it moving and hilarious."

1.0,city_lights,This film holds the title as the greatest romantic comedy ever made...and justifiably so. It tugs at your heartstrings without uttering a single word.
1.0,city_lights,"A great example of the fact that a motion picture doesn't have to be difficult or complicated to be good. ""City Lights"" is not a difficult movie to understand (maybe the easiest silent movie ever). If you have to teach someone about silent movies, show this picture and let it speak for itself."
1.0,city_lights,"One of the best romantic comedies of all time with the most brilliant ending of all time. I mean, I'm not the most romantic guy on earth but at the end I was pretty damn touched..."

1.0,city_lights,Just a Fantastic Movie!
1.0,city_lights,"Chaplin's sentimental side was never more delicately stated. But his funny side, as he desperately tries to earn money for the operation that will restore the girl's sight, was never more hilariously deployed than it was in this spare, curiously haunting film"
1.0,city_lights,"City Lights stands as one of Chaplin's finest accomplishments. Chaplin's physical hi-jinx are as brilliant as ever, but it's the love story with the blind flower girl that makes City Lights stand the test of time."
1.0,city_lights,"City lights although me being young, was one of the best movies i have seen as charlie captures the true essense of comedy. Some of the sences are a bit strange but all together makea great movie."
1.0,city_lights,Saw it when I was a kid and absolutely loved it (still do). This is one of those rare movies that can bring prolonged suffocating and often painful laughs that gets to me every single time. Also makes you appreciate comedy for what it truly is.
1.0,city_lights,"""can you see now?"" ""yes i can see now.""  a very enjoyable love story accompanied by the theme of the continuous fight between economic classes.."

1.0,city_lights,"It's hard not to fall in love with Charlie Chaplin. By that I don't just mean his characters on-screen, either: his directing and storytelling is imaginative and best of all, life-affirming. One of the most touching endings to a film ever conceived."

1.0,city_lights,"Forget your modern RomComs, this is the film to really pull your heart strings, a man's quest for the woman he loves, and will do anything for her, all for the fact that she's blind. The most romantic film ever."
1.0,city_lights,Quite possibly the funniest movie ever.Truly meticulous and absurd in the amount of detail and thought put into every scene or shot. What seems as though just for laughs is really for head scratches and maybe some soiled jeans.Super filmmaking
1.0,city_lights,My favorite Chaplin film of all time. Possibly my favorite film of all time. Perfect.

1.0,city_lights,"this is the best silent film ever made, near-flawless."
1.0,city_lights,"The epitome of Humanist Cinema. Anyone who can get through the final frames of this Film with dry eyes should undergo a drastic reevaluation of his/her life. For if it be so, something has been torn from his/her soul somewhere along the way --- possibly never to be regained."
1.0,city_lights,"If ever a comedian pushed the limits of a genre that gets little to no critical recognition, it was Chaplin. This film sums up all of the greatest possibilites you can acheive when you dangerously mix comedy and sentiment. He pulls it off beautifully in this film."

1.0,city_lights,The last scene slew me...
1.0,city_lights,Timeless Romantic Comedy

1.0,city_lights,Charlie Chaplin can express more with a look than most can with a torrent of words. Subtlety at its finest.
1.0,city_lights,"see it, we are watching a legend here"
1.0,city_lights,Chaplin's masterpiece. City Lights remains 77 years later one of the most moving films I've ever seen and one of the great movie love stories. Chaplin remains one of the funniest actors in cinema and his films remain some of the most perfect and sentimental.
1.0,city_lights,I loved it!! It was so great. Chaplin never fails to get a laugh.
1.0,city_lights,OBRA MAESTRAAAAAAAAAAAAA

1.0,city_lights,Chaplin's first masterpience
1.0,city_lights,"Best Movie ever made...the comedy is funnier; the romance is more genuine; the pathos is pathos-ier... if you get a chance, see it with an audience."
1.0,city_lights,"City Lights is the #1 Romantic Comedy according to AFI and I agree hands down. If you enjoy the genre this masterpiece is a must see. It will make you laugh, cry and it will linger in your thoughts long after watching it. How many movies can do that?? Not many."
1.0,city_lights,I don't know if a movie can ever get any better than this.
1.0,city_lights,so sweet and funny. it's so fun watching this movie over again and noticing all of the things that have been referenced in so many other films and tv shows.
1.0,city_lights,He he. Morsom film som må sees. Ikke bli skremt av at det er en stumfilm.
1.0,city_lights,Charles Chaplin is a movie-making genius. I dare you not to laugh!
1.0,city_lights,Deffinently one of Chaplin's Greatest films.
1.0,city_lights,I think this is Chaplin's best film. Chaplin is at his best and the emotional roller coaster ride you go on in this movie leaves you exhausted by the end (in a good way). You can't help but feel for The Tramp as he does everything he can to help this blind flower girl.
1.0,city_lights,"A la fin, quand la jolie fleuriste dÃ©couvre l'identitÃ© de son bienfaiteur, impossible de ne pas fondre en larmes."
1.0,city_lights,"Beautiful set pieces. The blind girl. The Tramp. And the flowers. A great romantic delight from start to end. The prizefight part is one of the early comedies greatest achievement. And the final scene is just hearbreaking, despite the fact that the couple find each other in the end."
1.0,city_lights,The best Charlie Chaplin film!
1.0,city_lights,My favorite Chaplin performance and one of his best ever. Both poignant and prodigious in the era of Silent Films. An ardent display of great pantomime comedy and solemn romance that has an ending that will make you reach for a tissue.
1.0,city_lights,"The ending of this movie says it all. If you can watch it and not shed a tear you are in need of a doctor to check for a pulse. This movie is moving, funny, and a true classic."
1.0,city_lights,"This film just makes me feel overwhelmingly happy! A rare occurance, and probably the only romance I will ever like."
1.0,city_lights,Wow. This is something special.
1.0,city_lights,Easily one of the best movies ever made. =]
1.0,city_lights,Great movie. For a silent film it manages to have humor and romance blended in well together. The final scene is impeccable.
1.0,city_lights,Definitely one of the best endings to any film I've seen.
1.0,city_lights,"Not only is the film funny, but it contains a great measure of poignancy. End scene is *the* most moving in cinema."
1.0,city_lights,Classic silent cinema from a great pantomime. The resolution with City Lights may be one of the best in cinema. A funny and charming narrative with the beautiful Virginia Cherril.
1.0,city_lights,"Bellissimo. La scena finale è la più commovente della storia del cinema. E' divertentissimo, ma è anche drammatico, è romantico ma è anche impegnato, la musica (dello stesso Chaplin) è incredibile; c'è tutto, manca solo il sonoro ma non ci si fa proprio caso..."
1.0,city_lights,"One of those shows which directors repeatedly pay homage to, and deservingly so. The acting, comic timing, visual gags, and the lovely lovely ending make this timeless. And the boxing match is arguably one of the best comic scenes ever."
1.0,city_lights,Chaplin's most emotionally rich film. The final scene is a tearjerker.
1.0,city_lights,"This seems to be considered Chaplin's ""masterpiece"" by many, but my favorite is still Modern Times."
1.0,city_lights,"La mejor historia de amor se cuenta en silencio. Definitivamente una de las peli­culas que uno debe ver para decir ""yo he vivido""."
1.0,city_lights,Absolutely priceless...This film set the bar for all romantic comedies to come and very few (if any) have managed to live up to it.
1.0,city_lights,"tho i still think ""Modern Times"" is Chaplin's best...this one nearly ties it.....an absolute must see..the scene where the cat knocks the pot onto Chaplin's head while he sniffs the girl's flower is HILARIOUS...also the boxing match-PRICELESS..and then of course the tearjerker ending =masterpiece"
1.0,city_lights,Beautiful! I haven't been able to stop thinking about it.
1.0,city_lights,"Whatever superlative you like, use it."
1.0,city_lights,"It may be a silent movie, but the movie speaks volumes."
1.0,city_lights,A silent movie so good that even my 9 and 5 year olds love it.
1.0,city_lights,simply amazing. the ending truly is one of the greatest in cinema
1.0,city_lights,"Excellent Charles Chaplin film. Behind 'Modern Times' and 'The Great Dictator' for me, but it was amazing. One of the simplest definitions of a romantic comedy before the genre lost its touch along the way."
1.0,city_lights,"If the ending doesn't make you cry, you have no soul.Endlessly brilliant, funny, and so delightful; no matter how many times I watch it, it remains fresh, and further proves the genius of Charles Chaplin."
1.0,city_lights,My favorite Chaplin film. Everyone should see this movie about Chaplin's love for a blind flower girl and his attempts to get money from a drunken millionaire to restore her eyesight. The boxing scene is classic Chaplin and the ending is sure to bring a tear to your eye.
1.0,city_lights,THE LAST MINUTE.OH MY GOD.
1.0,city_lights,Chaplin's best film. An absolute joy to watch. One of the most poignant love stories as the Tramp tries to woo a blind flower girl. The ending is pure gold and brings a tear to my eye.
1.0,city_lights,"Arguably Chaplin's greatest silent, ""City Lights"" is a true masterpiece. With the universal message that love is blind, ""City Lights"" is a comedy that could make you cry (if you're the type--I personally never cry during movies)."
1.0,city_lights,"Saw this in my film class and enjoyed it quite a bit. Charlie Chaplin was hilarious, but the scenes with his crush were what stood out for me. Just a great movie overall."

1.0,city_lights,"Funny, touching, brilliant. One of the greatest film endings ever. I love this movie."
1.0,city_lights,One of the best Chaplins of all time. Also was listed as the top romantic movie according to the AFI. The boxing scene is also one of Chaplin's most classic+hilarious gags. Just a phenominal piece of movie making.
1.0,city_lights,I'm a big fan of Chaplin and hadn't seen it yet. When I saw recently that it was chosen as AFI's top romantic comedy of all-time I figured I was really missing out. I was right. It's a sweet story with great performances.
1.0,city_lights,His final smile is priceless. Chaplin shows more romantic passion here than most other movies without the benefit of a single spoken word. Timeless.
1.0,city_lights,One of my absolute favorite movies.
1.0,city_lights,Nobody does it better.
1.0,city_lights,Beautiful story... still fresh!

1.0,city_lights,Toda la pelicula y en especial la escena donde la cieguita confunde al vagabundo con un rico son geniales
1.0,city_lights,"AFI recently named this the greatest romantic comedy of all time. I agree. This movie combines pathos and comedy in a completely unique way. Probably the best final scene of all time in a movie. If you only see one silent film in your life, this would be the one to see. Long live the Tramp!!!"
1.0,city_lights,A very cute love story!
1.0,city_lights,One of the greatest movies ever made!

1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Great movie, Jack Benny perfect ham and Carole Lombard is always great."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"One of the top 10 comedies of all time. Jack Benny as Hamlet, directed by the great Ernst Lubitsch, one of Carole Lombard's last roles. The inspiration for Hogans Heroes. The immortal line ""What Hitler did to Poland, he did to Shakespeare!""."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"To Be or Not to Be is a relevant and layered satire, a blend of dark humor and sight gags, of comedy and morality."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Laughing at Hitler 25 years before Mel Brooks and making political suicide gags 21 years before Stanley Kubrick. I see you, Herr Lubitsch."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Laugh out loud funny when ""The Great Dictator"" or the remake struggled. Seek this one out!"
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,A comedy about totalitarian political system.
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"""To Be Or Not To Be"" was one of the greatest films made during World War II. Jack Benny and Carole Lombard were perfectly cast, however my vote goes to the greatest scene stealer of them all, Sig Rumann, in the role of ""Zo They call me Concentration Camp Erhardt?"""
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,A must-see. A film lampooning Hitler to great comedic effect in 1942. Absolutely incredible.

1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,E' stato definito il film perfetto e probabilmente lo è.
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,The greatest comedy ever
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"To think that a German director made this in 1942 is incredible. Ernst Lubitsch was laughing in the face of tragedy. Although serious themes are dealt with and mild peril is encountered, I was in stitches throughout. The Lubitsch Touch is in full effect."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Hilarious movie, one of the funniest films I've ever had the pleasure of watching."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,Ernst Lubitsch at his best.
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,a classic comedy unknown to many
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,Amazing blend of drama satire and comical silliness all around a tragic wartime story. Lombard was the beat female comic of the day and Jack Benny pulls of his only worthy movie role of a lifetime.
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,Lubitsch somehow finds a tone that perfectly balances comedy and gripping tension as you wonder how the characters will get out of predicament after predicament. Downright hilarious.
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"favorite line: heil myself....  ""why haven't you seen this really funny film yet?"" ....THAT is the question!"
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Otrolig glÃ¶d och udd med humor Ã¤r minst lika svart som ss-uniformen. Jack Bennys ""Heil myself"" som Hitler Ã¤r ju en omedelbar klassiker. Men detta Ã¤r lÃ¥ngt mycket mer Ã¤n bara en catch phrase-komedi."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,Esta comedia es más moderna en su timing y su estructura que muchas de las actuales. Una verdadera genialidad.
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"A daring, and ruthlessly funny, Nazi satire."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"It's certainly one of the finest comedies ever to come out of Paramount, the allegations of dubious taste missing the point of Lubitsch's satire - not so much the general nastiness of the Nazis as their unforgiveable bad manners"
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Made at the height of World War II, this satirical comedy is a perfect vehicle for Benny."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"glorious, unlike the latest tarantino wankfest."

1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Excellent comedy script. Inteligent, very authentic, flirting with other genres."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,We should all cry for living in a cinema world without Lubitsch the Prince Charming.
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,This must have pissed old Adolph off some what.A corking comedy and Benny was never better.A propoganda masterpiece....Heil Me!
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Hilarious, clever and ultimately relevant. But the directing is just incredible. The cuts, the structure, the timing and the pacing, even if the movie was awful it would be a pleasure to watch."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,Most folks know the Mel Brooks version but this is the orginal. If you HAVEN'T watched the Mel Brooks one watch this one FIRST!!! Mel is great and all but for a great old flick this is one of the best!! Comedy!! ACTION!! Nutzi's!!

1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Awesome movie, extremly funny."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"A brilliantly funny comedy from Ernst Lubitsch, portraying the oppression of the European countries under Hitler's rule while simultaneously reveling in the freedom to make fun of the Nazis to its heart's content. Wonderfully funny, greatly acted and marvelously written. Just a superb film."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"""Heil Myself."" A truly classic film. I saw it today on TCM and fell in love with it. Apparently just after filming the Japanese bombed pearl harbor. Actress Carole Lombard then became a activist selling war bonds but died in a plane crash. This was her final film."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,Undoubtedly one of the most brilliant comedy classics of all-time. Here is the master Ernst Lubitsch at his best. Carole Lombard and Jack Benny are just magnificent. Truly one of the greatest scripts in the history of cinema.
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,My favorite Lubitsch.

1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"I just discovered this movie recently, and I absolutely love it. A group of Polish actors foil a Nazi plot during WWII, but that's just the backdrop for a screwball comedy perfectly suited for Carole Lombard. Jack Benny is also great as her hammy husband."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Magistral Lubitsch. Y la escena del monologo de Hamlet, para llorar de risa hasta que se le sequen a uno los ojos. Obra Maestra."

1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"A masterpiece of an anti-Nazi satire comedy. Funny and intelligent. Every funny scene in this film has a clever twist. What other director has the sophisticated touch that Lubitsch has? He is truly a genius with elegant style!!! And of course, Carol Lombard is divine in this film."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,Schlicht und ergreifend genial. Keinesfalls zu verwechseln mit Mel Brooks' Remake...
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"A later Lubitsch, but not a lesser one.  Still hilarious and, one must say, rather brave, aping Hitler and Nazism right at the start of America's involvement in the war.  Plus, it stars Jack Benny. JACK BENNY. How fucking cool is that?"
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"without question, of the greatest movies of all time. the lubitsch touch is in full effect! the entire cast is simply brilliant and everyone delivers with top comedic timing especially jack benny (why didnt he act more!) and the resurgently popular carole lombard. quotable and hysterically funny."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,Just watch it. You'll understand.
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,Superby Lubitsch comedy bravely playing fast-and-loose with Hitler barely a year after Pear Harbour. A stunning achievement in which the laughs keep coming despite - or because of - how serious the jeopardy seems to be.

1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"If Casablanca is the perfect film, ""To Be Or Not To Be"" is the perfect comedy. Dark, smart, well written, acted and directed -- I think this is Lubitsch's greatest film."

1.0,101_dalmatians,I saw it a lot of times. *-*LUVELY.
1.0,101_dalmatians,An instant classic to close Clyde Geronimi's brilliantly-directed contribution to the Disney animated features canon. One of my favorites as well due to plenty of ROFLcopter moments from the villians.
0.0,101_dalmatians,not the biggest fan of the dalmation movies.
1.0,101_dalmatians,the animation is superb and they actually give character to pretty much every dalmatian. Cruella is a great villian and probably one of the most memeorable since its 1961 release.

1.0,paterson,"Charming, thought provoking and subtle, Paterson's story draws you in and leaves you envious of his simple life and his complex mind."
1.0,paterson,"A film around a poem of the past, a town after which the poem was named and a fictional poet who drives a bus. It shows ordinary life in detail and with kindness. It is touching and heartening, absolutely wonderful."
1.0,paterson,Absolutely loved this movie. This is an enjoyable date night film. One of those stories you want to watch over again.
0.0,paterson,"BOORING. The most boring movie I have ever seen. I do not write reviews, but had to to warn everyone about this movie. Don't waste your time."
0.0,paterson,"utter pale of crap.the best movie to watch playing with your phone. boring to hell, nothing happening, I don't get all this hype about it."
0.0,paterson,Boring boring boring. If you like the poet William Carlos Williams who was interested in the ordinary go see it. It's like watching Seinfeld without any comedy.
0.0,paterson,"not my kind of thing, didn't go anywhere although in must admit i did give it 40 mins of my life. so slow."
1.0,paterson,Maravillosa. Una oda a la belleza en la cotidianidad.
1.0,paterson,Three words: Ohio Blue Tip.
1.0,paterson,A film about the special group of people - having an urge for creativity. Ordinary people can be very creative and truly happy as a result says Jim Jarmusch in a very poetical way
1.0,paterson,"Paterson is a beautiful portrait of human kindness, observing life in its gentle simplicity. Brilliant direction by Jim Jarmusch and genuine acting by Adam Driver make a good combo."
0.0,paterson,terrible. i cant imagine how anyone thought this was a good movie.
0.0,paterson,This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Didn't make it to the end. My word and I both decided to shut it off.
1.0,paterson,The tender simplicity of Paterson speaks volumes.
0.0,paterson,Zero divided by zero equals Jim Jarmusch has become a shitty director. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
1.0,paterson,Art and meditation. This movie is a piece of art beautiful with a lesson about mind relaxation. I loved it. Kept looking at everything on the screen not just the actors because of the hidden clues about being present in the moment. Adam Driver was excellent.
1.0,paterson,Fantastic tone poem of a film. Highly recommend reading some modern poetry esp. New York School i.e. O'Hara and Koch plus WCW (Williams Carlos Williams).
1.0,paterson,??? ???? ??? ???? ?????? ?? ?? ????? ??
0.0,paterson,"WTF !Start off by saying I'm a big Adam Driver fan.This was not a story, it was just watching someone's boring life for about a week.kill me"
0.0,paterson,"slow, slower, slowest, boring, pointless....96%...must be misguided liberal lefties that endorse the the violence at UC Berley as we ""middle Americans"" are unable to see value in ""Manchester"" (white glorification), ""Fences""(black glorification)"
0.0,paterson,"Put these characters out of their misery, please."
0.0,paterson,Like watching paint dry.
1.0,paterson,"Best film of the year, one of the few wonderful films of the decade, one of Jarmusch's most powerful films."
0.0,paterson,Very slow movie and it never connected the dots!!! I can't understand how it got all the great ratings.
0.0,paterson,My time would have been better spent taking a nap.
1.0,paterson,cute adorable movie.
1.0,paterson,"An extremely well carved film that truly celebrates the mundain. Its beautifully shot, with every shot having a meaning and a purpose. Although not having a plot or anything interesting it never gets boring. I highly recommend it."
1.0,paterson,Its a poem. Its what cinema can be. But don't come to this one looking for cheap thrills.
1.0,paterson,This is a wonderful film. I have never seen such a beautiful and emotionally convincing portrayal of tenderness between people. It's a must see.
1.0,paterson,"The slowest of slow burns...but Paterson is a remarkable thinker, and he makes you think as he does."
1.0,paterson,I give this a 100/A+.
0.0,paterson,"Not worth watching, rather spend those two hours on so many other great movies. This was a mix of ordinary mundane life scenes that unlike great movies hardly leads to anything coherent and useful."
0.0,paterson,"As someone who loves slow meditations of everyday life, I'm baffled by this ineffectual, miserable slice of bullshit. The worst poetry I've ever read."
1.0,paterson,"A gentle lovely film , full of great observations and very very funny"
1.0,paterson,I've always wondered what a film would be like if it was to simply showcase everyday life. Paterson gave me exactly what I wanted. It was peaceful and it showed how intriguing ordinary life can be.
1.0,paterson,"Refreshingly thought-provoking, moving, funny, riveting, and featuring a tour-de-force performance by Adam Driver, Paterson is one of Jim Jarmsuch's best films, and it's definitely one of the year's best movies!"
1.0,paterson,"Delicate, warm and wonderfully boring. It gave me that funny feeling in my stomach when everything seems so beautiful for about a week."
0.0,paterson,In a way it was funny. The whole thing went against the principle of Chekov's gun except the actual gun in the movie. The whole movie was intolerable and felt as if it was made to the self satisfaction of Jim Jarmusch.
0.0,paterson,The most boring movie I have even sat all the way through. I kept hoping something interesting would happen but it never does. Completely pointless!
0.0,paterson,A meditative drama that is neither poignant nor engaging to watch. It's 2016; are we still expected to be impressed by a white man doing nothing on screen for two hours?
1.0,paterson,"Such a beautiful, gentle film!"
0.0,paterson,Most boring film I've ever seen
0.0,paterson,If you're a fan of watching paint dry.

1.0,paterson,stars when you shine you know how i feelim feeling good
1.0,paterson,Every once in a while I see a film whose world I want to live in. This is one of those films.
0.0,paterson,"I don't have the patience for this kind of thing. Maybe you do, and more power to you. But two hours of more-or-less nothing just doesn't do it for me. Also there's something deeply off-putting about scrawling poetry across a film. If I wanted to read poetry, I would read poetry."
1.0,paterson,"Paterson is a beautiful, quiet film where a man's world is a universe of interconnectedness and poetry. I felt and loved every moment. My favourite film at the cinema this year."
0.0,paterson,"So that's two hours of my life I'll never get back. Although a regular arthouse-goer, I have never been so bored. Also annoyed that the wife was represented in such a one-dimensional way - thought she had more potential to be a more interesting central character if explored."
1.0,paterson,I'm in awe of this film.
1.0,what_we_do_in_the_shadows,"Honestly one of the funniest films I've ever seen. It's very unique and creative. If you are creating a mockumentary, this is how you do it. 10/10"

1.0,1003033-brazil,"I always answer the question of what my favorite movie is with ""Repo Man, but the best movie ever made is Brazil by Terry Gilliam"" A masterpiece, really"
1.0,1003033-brazil,it's one of the few movies that only gets better the more you watch it
1.0,1003033-brazil,wonderful.. and terrible
1.0,1003033-brazil,Moral of the story: Don't kill bugs
1.0,1003033-brazil,"In the pantheon of science fiction lies this landmark of cinema that drives home the twisted visuals blended with an increasingly intense plot. The iconic images and expansive spectacle of it all leaves almost no room to the imagination, simply because it's done so well in capturing it all."
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Amazing, beautiful, hilarious, extremely interesting, political, smart."
1.0,1003033-brazil,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. In my opinion, this is Terry Gilliam's best film. The cinematography is beautiful. Great cast and wonderful story."
0.0,1003033-brazil,Any competent director/editor could fart out the first half of the movie in 15 minutes and not lose anything of substance. A boring slogging mess.
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Quirky and visionary, but the darkness that imbues through the cracks is what sets it apart."
1.0,1003033-brazil,One of my all time favourite movies. Terry Gilliam at his best.
1.0,1003033-brazil,A superb example of the power of science fiction to anticipate futuretrends by extrapolating it from present reality.
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Brazil is a combination of Orwellian, Kafkaesque, and Cyberpunk themes/aesthetics that creates a surreal experience, fudging the lines between film and dream, which is both bizarre and delightful. I would recommend it, just be sure to fill out you 27B/6 and sign your receipt."
1.0,1003033-brazil,Great movie showing the efficiency of a government .
1.0,1003033-brazil,The best film by Terry Gilliam is this dystopian black comedy. A film that works on so many levels and uses so many elements. I am short of words to express how much I love it.
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Brazil tickles the mind, portraying the entire film from the perspective of Jonathan Pryce's Sam Lowry. A dystopian view of this film can make one ask oneself whether Jill, the main female lead, ever even exists, or is a symbol of Lowry's lament for the bureaucratic autocracy he finds himself in."
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Brilliant. My favorite Gilliam, except for maybe Time Bandits."
1.0,1003033-brazil,This film is as close to perfect as it gets

1.0,1003033-brazil,"Dark, satirical and visually outstanding vision of the possible future in a totalitarian society."
1.0,1003033-brazil,A masterpiece of the last century.
1.0,1003033-brazil,"One of the best if not the best movie made. Quirky, funny, unique, human, and such a great expose of bureaucracy and the Big Brother state."
1.0,1003033-brazil,Can I give it more than 5 stars?
1.0,1003033-brazil,The Best Movie Ever. Period.
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Brilliantly bizarre, funny and terrifying"
1.0,1003033-brazil,How did Terry Gilliam know? Amazingly spot on prophetic vision of our present police state!
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Best Terry Gilliam film of all. One of the most interesting, thought provoking & funniest films of all time."
1.0,1003033-brazil,Brazil clutters the screen with a maze-like world of useless technology and inundated bureaucracy. Wonderfully disturbing and beautifully brought to life by director Terry Gilliam.

1.0,1003033-brazil,"Terry Gilliam's Cinematic Masterpiece is a study in satire, surrealism, absurdism and paranoia. It is also most importantly an innovative and stunning view of the power of human imagination and love that no government or person can ever suppress. Profoundly important."
1.0,1003033-brazil,"One of my top 5 movies of all time. Bold, paranoid, disturbing, inspiring, emotionally riveting and brilliant in many ways."
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Gilliams undisputed masterpiece, presenting a futuristic nightmare of burocratic dimensions. Wild and satiric, gouging out the madness of ineffiancy which are pulled down our heads by the government. Naturally a box-office failure, though today a cult classic. Gilliams best work."
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Part social commentary, this film plays like a comedic version of George Orwell's 1984. Filled with imaginative visuals, along with having dark witty comedy, and an over-the-top storyline, Terry Gilliam's masterpiece, Brazil, is a real gem."
1.0,1003033-brazil,To be re-watched ad infinitum
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Totally whacky, but dark. Loved it."
1.0,1003033-brazil,"A tour-de-force of dark comedy, terror, whimsy, and insufferable bureaucracy."
1.0,1003033-brazil,"While it may be maybe a little too slow paced considering its nearly 2 and a half our runtime, Brazil offers one of the best written sci fi movies ever, with great surrealism, art direction and political satire"

1.0,1003033-brazil,"The highest point of Terry Gilliam's career; the director presents a unique look into the wonders of the imagination in an alarmingly boring (possibly foreshadowing) world. The film truly shines, with excellent performances from both Jonathan Pryce and Michael Palin."
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Whimsically dark and visually insane, Terry Gilliam's Brazil is an indescribable achievement of production and direction."
1.0,1003033-brazil,Imagination of Terry Gilliam is stunning. George Orwell would be proud.

1.0,1003033-brazil,My absolute #1 movie. Exactly how I envision the future to be. Everything automated but never working and a fat bureaucratic government that can't get anything right.

1.0,1003033-brazil,"It's a bizarre, surreal, dark, other-worldly, funny, dramatic, over-the-top and epic experience. One of my favourite films for sure!"
1.0,1003033-brazil,"If I were to try to describe Brazil in only a few words, those words would consist of visceral, intense, sardonic, entertaining, and at times surreal. Brazil succeeds at being, not only an intense, entertaining story and plotline, but also as a thought-provoking psychological study."

1.0,1003033-brazil,"Very clever, striking visuals, and brilliant film making."
1.0,1003033-brazil,"My other Christmas gift. Criterion's Blu-ray of the 146 min. director's cut. Still an amazing film, and its view of a world without privacy was remarkably prophetic."
1.0,1003033-brazil,"In one word, Amazing"
1.0,1003033-brazil,One of the greatest sci-fi films I've seen since Bladerunner and one of the greatest satires I've seen since Dr. Strangelove
1.0,1003033-brazil,"This film is a great visionary film from Terry Gilliam. It hits on themes that are still relevant today such as government abuse of information, technology, and terrorism. A must see if you are an avid film lover."
1.0,1003033-brazil,"If you expect this movie to have a happy ending, then you're a moron."
1.0,1003033-brazil,Surrealism at its finest.

1.0,1003033-brazil,or havnt you noticed yet
1.0,1003033-brazil,An amazing visual feet. A chilling vision of the Orwell's 1984 mixed with a quirky sense of humor. Strange and surreal. The story of a man trapped in the gears of the bureaucratic machine trying to find his dream girl.
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Terry Gilliam's visionary Orwellian masterpiece is as unique as it gets. You really haven't seen anything quite like it! Odd, unusual, hilariously dark and full of mesmerizing visuals, it's a must see for all film lovers. Gilliam is a true artist!"
1.0,1003033-brazil,Brazil is like Monty Python in the future. It is that funny and good.
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Everything that a Terry Gilliam and a scifi film should be. However, Mr. Gilliam is not so great at dialogue. You will have to suffer through some of the clunkiest dialogue ever but its well worth it."
0.0,1003033-brazil,"Seen it, but I just don't understand what people like so much about it. I couldn't wait for it to finally end. Plus, Gilliam is a shit director who's made little more than Time Bandits..."
1.0,1003033-brazil,"One of my favorite films of all time. So surreal and hopeless and sweet. Even with the weak ending, it still had me wishing I could go back in time and see it again for the first time."
1.0,1003033-brazil,"If Phillip K. Dick and Douglas Adams wrote 1984 chances are it would look something like Brazil; Visually goregous, smartly written, just as funny as it horrifing, and as interesting as any dystopia I've ever seen."
1.0,1003033-brazil,One of the top five greatest films ever made.
1.0,1003033-brazil,The best movie. ever.

1.0,1003033-brazil,Gilliam's masterpiece.
1.0,1003033-brazil,"One of my all-time favorite movies. A dark fantasy on many levels. One of my favorite playwrights, Tom Stoppard, helped Terry create a masterful script. The music and sound help carry the movies tense atmosphere. Don't bother with any version other than the final cut."
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Love that movie. Really reminded me of the book of George Orwell, 1984. i love how dark and criative are the visuals in this film, the acting is also great, everthing works. Simply an unique master piece."
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Terry Gilliam's dystopian comedy is something of a cross between A Clockwork Orange, Monty Python and Blade Runner. A strange mixture no doubt, but the ingenious script and sweet surrealism make this movie an absolute masterpiece. Avoid the version with the happy ending at all costs!"
1.0,1003033-brazil,Love this movie so much
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Such a twist to remember, Brazil is another Gilliam film that will stay in your memory. Bureaucrazy is a main theme and it's great."

1.0,1003033-brazil,"A visionary movie from Terry Gilliam! Inspiring, crazy, dark! At first, it's hard to enter into this imaginary world, but after that, it's pure joy!"
1.0,1003033-brazil,This film should be shown to all of the vice deputy sub assistants working in human resource departments.
1.0,1003033-brazil,Dystopia at its best. The idea that red tape and paperwork can actually cause a man to dissapear is a prominent feature in the film. This is a great film. It has several different endings that were filmed and it is difficult to decide on a favorite.
0.0,1003033-brazil,Seriously just how much acid did gilliam take before making this piece of shit?This easily slides into my top 5 worst films ever made.Appalling

1.0,1003033-brazil,"Bizarre and brilliant, Terry Gilliam's take on a totalitarian, dystopian future manages to be just as topical as the books it pokes fun at, while adding a level of hilarity, emotion and grandiosity its predecessors lacked."

1.0,1003033-brazil,"The best Gilliam movie! However stay far away from the ""Love conquers all"" TV-edited version!"
1.0,1003033-brazil,"loosly based off the orwell novel 1984, set in somewhere in the 20th century, this fantasy is packed full of terry gilliam's imagitive storytelling and is a biting satire on 80s' indulgences such as cosmetic surgery. a wonderful film"
0.0,1003033-brazil,"INCREDIBLY OVERRATED. Yes, it's got some good imagery and makes some decent political/social statements and it even conjures a fair amount of thinking in the viewer. But it's just not worth it. The movie is so scattered and irritatingly surreal (and not in a good way either)."
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Funny, quirky, fascinating, and Genius"
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Sad and hilarious, Gilliam makes you weep and laugh at the condition of modern man, and perhaps through the experience reach some sort of catharsis."
1.0,1003033-brazil,Gilliam's masterpiece. I'm a little terrified its all coming true.

1.0,1003033-brazil,"Completely surreal and dull at points, which caused me to strongly consider giving this a poor rating, but the intelligence behind this film wins overall."
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Director Terry Gilliam's Brazil captures its message of insane bureaucrats, surrealism, and insane dark humor to a tee. This movies way of showing how needlessly complicated we make things to supposedly make them easier is brilliant, and by far one of my favorites."
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Monty Python's take on 1984. If you like Orwell, you'll like this."
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Such a wonderfully weird film. Terry Gilliam is a master with visuals, and this is easily the one of the best things that he's ever done. It certainly hasn't aged either since its release 26 years ago. And hopefully, it'll continue to stand the test of time."

1.0,ratatouille,"A movie with this kind of far-fetched plot could only be received well through herculean type production, but luckily for Ratatouille, there was Brad Bird at the helm. Thus, a story about a chef rat became an instant classic and is personally one of my top 5 animated movies."

1.0,say_anything,One of the all-time great romantic comedies. John Cusack's star-making performance holds up over 25 years later. The film rightfully established Cameron Crowe as one of the great writer-directors of his generation.
1.0,say_anything,In this one film Cameron Crowe takes on every John Hughes film and wins. Effortlessly detailed.
1.0,say_anything,One of the best -- if not the best -- romantic comedies ever made.

1.0,say_anything,It's fucking John Cusack -.-

1.0,say_anything,"This movie, almost should be a documentary. It captures all the nuiances of love and heart ache. Say Anything blazed a path for all Rom-Com movies, and its one to treasure"

1.0,it_happened_one_night,I really do love this movie. And it's not because the main character's name is Ellie. I'm surprised that they haven't remade this movie yet. Hopefully they don't because I think that they would mess up this wonderful movie.
1.0,it_happened_one_night,"CRAZY, COMEDY, LOVE Classic Movie !"

1.0,my_fair_lady,Possibly the best telling of the story. Audrey is lovely - and convincing as she steals every scene.
1.0,my_fair_lady,i just love this film. the only bad thing is that when they sing they where dubbed
1.0,my_fair_lady,The very delightful adaptation of one of the longest-running Broadway musicals is exactly the sort of formal Hollywood spectacle that just isn't made anymore.

1.0,my_fair_lady,One of the best. I am Soo made they think they can do a remake of this movie its perfect the way it is and never should have to be redone. They will ruin it.
1.0,my_fair_lady,"By George! They managed to outshaw old GBS... Never has a musical score been written so wonderfully in step with the original text (Pygmalion). And, of course, it helps that the great Rex can't carry a tune but stays wonderfully in rhythm during his recitatives."

0.0,spy_2015,This movie was just plain boring with nothing original to offer and 50 cents career may as well be reconsidered as this film doesn't add much to his street cred. Basically just go watch Kingsman.
0.0,spy_2015,I'm always concerned how SNL skit comedy gets into these 2 hour movies and wreaks any good idea they may have had. This kind of comedy for me is just not that funny.
1.0,spy_2015,"Smart, action-packed and filled with tons of humour throughout, the third entry in the Feig-McCarthy ""saga"" manages to provide tons of entertainment with great performances from its cast and Jason Statham stealing the show in every scene he's in due to his gleefully profane character."
0.0,spy_2015,I couldn't even finish it.
1.0,spy_2015,Very nice movie. The thing is it had some REALLY nude scenes. Like huge nudity. So if you're going to see this with a kid then don't.

1.0,airplane,"Airplane is the greatest spoof film of all time, and one of the greatest comedies of all time. Every scene is just a huge laugh riot and whoever doesn't find this film hilarious is crazy. If you ever need to feel stupid and get in a good mood, watch this immediately."
1.0,airplane,"""Thats when I got my drinking problem"""
1.0,airplane,One of the funniest movies of all time! A+
0.0,airplane,lol just stupid as can be. but crazy.. can life be like this on a plane?
0.0,airplane,dumbest fucking movie i have ever seen! the only time I ever laughed was when the old lady hung herself! I felt like she and I were sharing the same thought!
1.0,airplane,"Surely, this movie can't be any better! It can't be any better. And don't call me Shirley!  Airplane?! What is it? It's an amazing movie with the funniest lines ever. But that's not important right now.  This movie is great, Over. (Roger, over. What? Huh? ....who?)"
1.0,airplane,classic comedy spoof movie full of laughter and great jokes!! A must see!
1.0,airplane,You don't know the meaning of laughter until you watch this film. An all time classic and one of my all time favourites.

1.0,airplane,one of the best comidies ever
1.0,airplane,OMG this was like the best movie ive EVER watched!! nearly peed my pants while i was at it lol this was humerous in a serious way and it just cant be missed out on. Next time you want to watch an old 1900s comedy-go with airplane. WATCH!!!!!
1.0,airplane,"Every time I watch this movie, I see another joke I didn't notice the time prior. The gags are as dumb as they are numerous. Fittingly regarded as one of the best comedies to come out of the 80's. Great for fans of stupid puns and silly double entendres."
1.0,airplane,"Anyone even remotely familiar with disaster movies will find this movie hilarious. In an age where comedy has become either stupid or self-aware, it's nice to watch a silly film that plays jokes straight and provides a camp, yet satisfying experience."
1.0,airplane,It was the beginning of Genre. What Genre I don't know but it was.
1.0,airplane,"I <3 this!  ""If Kramer finds out about this the shit's gonna hit the fan!""  *shit hits fan*"
1.0,airplane,"I can't be really objective because I saw this movie a billion times. What I can say is that it is timeless and every time I watch it, it makes me happy."
1.0,airplane,"Surely you can't be serious? I am serious, and don't call me Shirley."
1.0,airplane,"Shirley this is a hilarious movie. As punny and satiric as it is, I have never laughed as hard as I did while watching this. Also, kudos to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar for being a somewhat good actor-athlete. Leslie Neilsen is one of the greatest comedians to ever live, and Airplane! shows us that."
1.0,airplane,a great film! hilarious all the way through!
1.0,airplane,"An absolute classic, this movie will live for years due to its memorable lines and hilarious actions."

1.0,airplane,Perfect for what it is. And what it is is a must-see.

1.0,airplane,"Sensational. Makes all the current rip off movies (Scary Movie 12, Epic Movie, etc) look like the pile of shit they are."
1.0,airplane,I wish I could give it even more gold stars.
1.0,airplane,"Hilarious! This classic never ever gets old, even though I can still nearly repeat all the lines verbatim."
1.0,airplane,A comedy classic that I'm glad to have finally watched!

1.0,airplane,One of the funniest movies of all time! A true comedic classic!
1.0,airplane,"A perfect slapstick-absurdist comedy. This spawned so many ripoffs, some of which were actually fairly amusing. The scary thing is that the Airport movies that this lampoons aren't all that different from this comedy: they are unintentionally hilarious in their own right."
1.0,airplane,This is an amazing film. A true classic. I own this film and watch it every now and then and it never gets old.
1.0,airplane,excellent flick!!!!!

0.0,airplane,Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen.
1.0,airplane,"Just about the most hilarious hour and a half you can experience. Besides being one of the most quotable movies ever, the ludicrously silly comedy stands up to endless viewings, further solidifying its spot as a classic."
1.0,airplane,"This is the comedy that defined humor in movies and created the spoof genre. The humor holds up very well, there isn't a single joke that is unfunny. To call this a classic would be an understatement. One of the funniest movies of all time."
1.0,airplane,"A very funny movie, Leslie Neillson at his best."
1.0,airplane,Probably the best slapstick movie ever produced.
1.0,airplane,"One of the most seminal slapstick comedy's ever made, and deservedly so. The puns are brilliant (both in writing and in delivery), and the silliness is funny and never tired or forced!"
1.0,airplane,THE ONE THAT STARTED IT ALL. THIS MOVIE IS WHAT A TRUE SATIRE OR SPOOF SHOULD BE. HANDS DOWN...THE UNDISPUTED CHAMP OF COMEDY

1.0,airplane,Surely as good as modern comedy gets?...and don't call me Shirley.
0.0,airplane,With the lack of good jokes airplane fails to deliver any type of entertainment
1.0,airplane,"This is the way parody movies should be made, cough cough, VAMPIRES SUCK, cough."
1.0,airplane,Shirley your not serious.
1.0,airplane,"FUNNY very very FUNNY! This movie is got lots of great jokes, one liners, cameos, and physical humor. It is one the best movies of all time to me (probably top 10). The laughs just keep coming and I will never get tired of watching it over and over again. What a classic."
