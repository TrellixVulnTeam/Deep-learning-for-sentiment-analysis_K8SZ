0.0,johnny_guitar,"We don't get this rating at all! I would say that the movie scrip, cast, dialog and setting are So Bad it is a must see to believe. The buggy ride is hilarious with the high speed background flying by at breakneck speed."
1.0,johnny_guitar,"Classic gender bending western, almost entirely set in one location, that balances thrills, camp and righteous anger brilliantly."
1.0,johnny_guitar,my favourite 'psychological' western with a whole gay subtext-good stuff
1.0,johnny_guitar,The strangest the most bizzar most unusual and the most amazingly shot western ever made.
1.0,johnny_guitar,"As kinky as it gets in the 50s. Almost seems like a Western as directed by Sam Fuller. Full of symbolism, great performances and direction."
0.0,johnny_guitar,"Probably the worst movie I have ever seen. Everything sucks about it. The lighting, the acting, the shots, the costumes, the sets, even the guitar playing! On the plus side its absolutely hilarious. ""Down there all I sell is Cards and Whiskey...Up here all you can buy is a bullet to the head!"""
1.0,johnny_guitar,Its sexual themes transcend its genre. Making it one of the oddest and freshest westerns to date.
1.0,johnny_guitar,This is why Nicholas Ray is one of my favorite directors.
1.0,johnny_guitar,fantastic Nicholas Ray
1.0,johnny_guitar,"I feel like this unique western deserves more attention, first of all, for challenging traditional gender roles; and second of all for being a fantastic movie."
1.0,johnny_guitar,Why is this movie pretty dang awesome? Hello it's titled Johnny Guitar.
1.0,johnny_guitar,This movie was beautiful!!!
1.0,johnny_guitar,one of the best movies i have seen and in my opinion the best performances i have seen by almost all of the actors.what A MOVIE!!!!!!!!!and the music was wonderful.i loved the song and the voice of peggy lee
0.0,johnny_guitar,One of the worst movies I've ever seen. And the lady in red shirt looked just like Michael Jackson.
1.0,johnny_guitar,Love Nicholas Ray! Love Sterling Hayden! Love this movie! There has never been western like this one before or after. A absolute must see classic!
1.0,johnny_guitar,"Very interesting western! Mercedes McCambridge's character is amongst the most lowlife sexually repressed villains I've seen. Joan Crawford is said to have disliked this movie, but nonetheless it's a real work of art."
1.0,johnny_guitar,"One of the best westerns of the 1950's, a great decade for the genrre. Every aspect of the film is intelligent and boils with honesty from the screenplay to Nicholas Ray's subtle directing. Joan Crawford is outstanding and composes one of the least stereotyped woman characters ever seen on film."
1.0,johnny_guitar,La geste incroyable d'un immense realisateur. Johnny Guitar est a proprement parler terrassant.
1.0,johnny_guitar,"One of the best westerns ever, where the genre turns into tragedy and avoids its cliches. Unforgettable performances by Joan Croawford and Sterling Hayden, Nicholas Ray at his best and an astonishing work on photography by Harry Stradling, to support the weak Trucolor system."
1.0,johnny_guitar,An excellent chamber western and a searing psychological drama far superior to many dramas made at the time and fine acting by an excellent cast.
1.0,johnny_guitar,One of the most memorable films that I have ever seen.
1.0,johnny_guitar,"I love this movie the actors,story,the camp truly faboulous"
1.0,johnny_guitar,Film making at its best. It doesn't get any better than this. Nicholas Ray is a genious. The screams at the end it creates...... more... more they say more more MORE!!
1.0,johnny_guitar,EXCELENTE. Lo mejor de la cinta son sus personajes femeninos.
1.0,johnny_guitar,BLOODY FUCKIN GREAT... some feminists should see this before all that TV-bullshit...
1.0,johnny_guitar,So bizarre--love the real-life feud between Crawford and McCambridge.
1.0,johnny_guitar,The death/rebirth thing all the way through is profoundly wierd. An extraordinary collision of genius.
1.0,johnny_guitar,Sterling Hayden plays the guitar and Joan Crawford plays a man.
0.0,johnny_guitar,"Achei sem pé nem cabeça, idiota. Talvez seja porque eu não gosto de westerns e não acho graça em tiroteios à toa.Joan Crawford tenta dar uma de Dietrich, fazendo o papel da mulher masculinizada , independente e que tem um monte de homens que a adoram."
1.0,johnny_guitar,"Nick Ray, este si, el unico rebelde con causa"
1.0,johnny_guitar,Classic Nicholas Ray
1.0,johnny_guitar,"Grandissimo western che mette alla berlina tutti gli stereotipi del genere; la vicenda culmina con il grottesco duello finale fra due donne. L'amore trionfera', come sempre."
1.0,johnny_guitar,1er film en trucolor! western mythique!!
1.0,johnny_guitar,un des plus beaux western que je connaisse... une vraie tragédie shakespearienne
1.0,johnny_guitar,Exei tromero endiaferon na vlepeis dyo gynaikes na ksekatiniazontai. Eidika otan vriskontai sthn agria dysh.
1.0,johnny_guitar,"The manliest Western of all time, starring two women."
1.0,johnny_guitar,"the best ""classic"" western i've ever seen, if not the best western i've ever seen. hugely entertaining, stunningly beautiful and completely perverse, it's like a film and critical theory nerd's wet dream come true. love me, love this movie."
1.0,johnny_guitar,"I don't know or care if your into westerns but this is the one that counts.Come on people westerns are a reflexing of our lives. It's are hopes, dreams and will to survive. Joan Crawford just kicks ass in this film that's all I need to say!"
1.0,johnny_guitar,a really different take on the regular western.. this is it.
1.0,johnny_guitar,Hard to overpraise this one.
1.0,johnny_guitar,"Wonderful melodrama; at times it reminded me of Fassbinder's Whitey. One of Joan Crawford's finest performances, and I loved the menacing momentum of the posse."
1.0,johnny_guitar,Campy western with outstanding cast and intriguing story.
1.0,johnny_guitar,This incredible female driven western redefines what the genre is capable of.
1.0,johnny_guitar,"Marvellously ripe modernist Western. Idealism goes up in flames, the respectable townsfolk are a murderous mob, sexual desire underlies every move. Glorious colours splash across the screen; deep rivers of subversion flow beneath them."
1.0,johnny_guitar,Very good .. for a western! :)
1.0,johnny_guitar,very psychosexual :)
1.0,johnny_guitar,Technicolour feminist western?!?! Watch this movie.
1.0,johnny_guitar,"joan whips out her inner-phallus and cock-slaps mercedes and just about everyone, everything in this demented western."
1.0,johnny_guitar,"Ignore Johnny Guitar- he's just a bit player. The real story is between the strong, beautiful and ambitious owner of Vienna's and the scorned woman who'd like to see her hanged. This movie takes 'bitch fight' to a whole new level."
1.0,johnny_guitar,"If you ever want a western to love, love this one."
1.0,johnny_guitar,"Possibly my favourite Nick Ray film, lurid melodramatic with brilliant performances from Sterling Hayden and Crawford. Beautiful camerawork as well. Extraordinary."
1.0,johnny_guitar,"LOVE this red scare metaphorical western with Joan in top form battling a jealous female foe,ala a underscoring of Freudian theory. And they even shoot it out at the end!"
1.0,johnny_guitar,"Seen as a flop upon release, Nicholas Ray's classic of the screen really has no categorization. The mise en scene is flawless as the screen unfolds scenes of brilliance, one at a time. Like Godard once wrote in Cahiers du Cinema, ""Nicholas Ray is cinema""."
1.0,johnny_guitar,Now this is a good movie Joan is tough.
1.0,johnny_guitar,Super Western.... He man Joan.
1.0,johnny_guitar,one of my top 10 fav joan pics!!! a great twist on the tired western formula with a deep red scare messege by director ray.
1.0,johnny_guitar,"You can't beat a gun toatin', heart breakin', saloon' keepin' Joan, so don't even try."
1.0,block_party,Best concert film I know and I've seen them all. Celebration of African American music and wit benevolently hosted by the guy on the marquee.
0.0,block_party,Nice attempt but really just one big bore.
1.0,block_party,"This is the sort of movie that the ""special interest"" section was invented for. Basically it's a comedy/documentary/performing arts hybrid thats simply cool. It's got some great musicians, Dave Chapelle, and Michael Gondry directing. pretty hard to go wrong!"
1.0,block_party,In my top 20 all time. This film is so perfect.
1.0,block_party,"Some very good rap peppered with Dave Chappelle's infectiously funny personality and an entire marching band? Count me in! Actually, I woulda gone just for Dave, but y'know..."
1.0,block_party,The true hip-hop lovers movie... Hands down.
0.0,block_party,never should of been made.
1.0,block_party,"Dave Chappelle put together a pretty spectacular Brooklyn block party in 2004, and awesome director Michel Gondry was there to capture it."
1.0,block_party,"only dave chappelle to pull something like that , very original , really cool and real , awesome"

0.0,block_party,The biggest piece of shit I've ever seen....
0.0,block_party,this was a huge let down it was nothing more than a concert held on the street. Dave only made two jokes and they sounded like they were from a kids joke book. Lame!
1.0,block_party,"An almost perfect documentary from the director of ""Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind""..Great idea and editing, having the taste of a musical feature film !"
1.0,block_party,The idea for this movie is decades ahead of it's time. One of the best movies I've ever seen composed of probably one of the greatest concerts to ever happen. Thanks Dave lol.
0.0,block_party,Hugely overrated. This movie didnt make me laugh once 30 minutes in and I didnt even bother to finish it. The Chappelle Show if funny and I like that a lot but this attempt at a movie was a complete and total bomb.
0.0,block_party,Im a fan but not of the block party not worth the rent fee
1.0,block_party,"LOVE IT! Mos Def, Common, John Legend...the Roots, Jill Scott? WhaT?!?!?! INSANE line up. I wish i could have been there."
1.0,block_party,Awesome movie. It's not Chappelle's Show in movie form. But it's an awesome musical walk-through of a day in NYC. Down-to-Earth look at a bunch of Dave's favorite artists...including Kayne pre-ego inflation. And did I mention the Fugees reunited?
0.0,block_party,"all i remember about this movie was walkin out cuz it sucked so much. ya if you want a funny comedy. dont watch this, this is a documentary about a block party... litterally nothing interesting happening. you fuckin sell out dave chappelle."
0.0,block_party,I was bored! What can I say? I had high expectations because of the whole Rick James thing and his show but this wasn't funny to me at all

1.0,block_party,Now this movie was funny as hell!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,block_party,"Dave on hilarius, ja elokuva on hyväntuulinen ja kuulinen."
1.0,block_party,A must see. The big reunion of the finest Mc's and soul singer in the game. Dave chappelle for his humour and Gondry for himself.
1.0,block_party,"I wish I could have went to this concert... Kayne West, Common, Talib Kweli, Mos Def, The Fugees, Dead Prez and more and more.... Amazing..."
1.0,block_party,This movie can answer the questions: 1) Do I have a sense of humor? and 2) Have I got soul?

0.0,block_party,"This was disappointing, despite Michel Gondry behind the camera."
0.0,block_party,Highs: The Menu loop is fascinating. Just watching all the details of the activity.Lows: There was a goose and people singing lyrically vapid songs about Jesus. There may have been more to the movie that I missed.
1.0,block_party,"This movie opened my eyes to the hip hop that matters. I was moved to tears by most of the performances. Seriously, u know me, I wouldn't bluff about music."
1.0,block_party,"Michel Gondry dans tout ses états! revivez le Block Party avec KanYe West, Mos Def, Erikah Badu, The Fugees..."
1.0,block_party,i watched it three times and the commentary before i returned it to RAO video. required viewing for fans of chappelle or hip hop in general.
0.0,block_party,At least I didn't fall asleep like when I watched The Passion of the Christ. I woke up and they were still whipping Jesus. Not really what I had in mind. I might have gave a better rating if I listened to Rap music.
1.0,block_party,the ending shot is so good. cody chessnuTT and dave chappelle give each other a hug and the camera cuts before they break out of it. this film is all about love.

0.0,block_party,"God awful. This movie is so bad. Never did I think I'd see something that had Dave Chappelle in it that I would despise, but here it is. This is like a VH-1 Discovery channel special gone horribly wrong. From offbeat music to gypsies, what the hell was the point of this mess?"
1.0,block_party,Great movie with simple plot

1.0,block_party,THIS WAS GREAT. THE WAY HE WENT TO DIFFERENT PLACES AND SPOKE TO THE PEOPLE STRAIGHT OUT
1.0,block_party,This isn't about Dave's comedy. I saw some confused people in the theater when I was there. It's about *gasp* music and it's great if you're a hip-hop fan.
1.0,block_party,"It's a musical doc, assholes."

1.0,block_party,"I love the atmosphere of this movie, great chill out theme and music."
1.0,block_party,Good in every aspect.
1.0,block_party,"A hilarious documentary about Chappelle's attempt to hold a block party involving all his favorite rappers. It's thought-provoking, touching, and a great look inside one of comedy's greatest minds. It's a side of Chappelle you don't exactly always see...and that's a good thing."
1.0,block_party,This movie makes me proud to be black
1.0,block_party,"Excellent music, Excellent comedy, Excellent message - anybody with a brain and a good taste in music will enjoy this."

1.0,block_party,How could I not like this film when all my favourite rappers perform in it. Although it would have been much more hil...AR..ious with Nick Cannon as host.
1.0,block_party,"One of the greatest concert films of all time. It has a good heart, it has an incredible soundtrack, and I go back and rewatch this constantly. Don't see this movie for Dave Chappelle. See it for the music and the soul of the people."

0.0,florence_foster_jenkins_2016,"Truly, aren't we all just really sick of Meryl Streep playing this same, bored and boring, wrote character and style in all of her movies at this point. I think Robin Williams as Mrs. Doubtfire woud have done a better job in this."
1.0,florence_foster_jenkins_2016,"Streep is a cinematic goddess who manages to inspire Hugh Grants best, most moving performance ever, giving Simon Helberg a stellar launching pad into movie stardom."
0.0,florence_foster_jenkins_2016,This was an awful and incredibly boring movie. I would have walked out of the movie but was with Meryl Streep fans who of course loved it. I should have been paid to see it like then people who were paid to listen to Florence sing.
0.0,florence_foster_jenkins_2016,I didn't like it. And I didn't want to see this film in the first place. I was dragged to it.Meryl Streep has lost her touch. Oscar Worthy maybe but not in my eyes.
1.0,florence_foster_jenkins_2016,"Even those aware of this atrocious singing voice, may not have known the back story. Meryl Streep portrayed it magnificently."

1.0,florence_foster_jenkins_2016,"The audience laughed out loud at Simon Helberg, who nearly steals the show despite having a secondary role. Hugh Grant's acting is magnificent -- it's as much his character arc that moves the show and not Meryl Streep's character."
1.0,florence_foster_jenkins_2016,Hilarious and touching all at the same time. There were parts where I couldn't stop laughing. Got an ovation in our theater.

0.0,florence_foster_jenkins_2016,"Despite the dream team cast, listening to an hour and 50 minutes of the worst singing you have ever heard, is a pure turture.

1.0,my_fair_lady,"By George! They managed to outshaw old GBS... Never has a musical score been written so wonderfully in step with the original text (Pygmalion). And, of course, it helps that the great Rex can't carry a tune but stays wonderfully in rhythm during his recitatives."

1.0,we_are_the_best,"So endearing, so fun, so true. I enjoyed every bit of that film, it made me happy, not by pampering, but by being sincere. It's energetic, rash and irresistibly fun; which, added to its unconventional aspect, makes it truly punk in spirit. Or progg, at least XD"
1.0,we_are_the_best,Currently on the number one spot for my favourite film of 2014 and I doubt that is going to change. 'We are the best' perfectly captures the essence of being a kid and is hilarious from start to finish.

1.0,mary_poppins,Walt Disney's live-action masterpiece is even better on the big screen. And it is always surprising how well it ages (much better than The Sound of Music) and how well written and scripted it is. The soundtrack is one of the best ever put to film.
1.0,mary_poppins,Love the music and the story.

1.0,the_young_girls_of_rochefort,"Colorful, fun, and full of dancing and music, ""The Young Girls of Rochefort"" is probably the first French musical I've ever seen, and it's catchy tunes and upbeat jazz stylings have made it an instant favorite of mine."
0.0,the_young_girls_of_rochefort,"I don't know why this is so highly rated. Although it has star appeal, the writing is abyssmal, the music boring and repetitive, the dance numbers uninspired, and the storyline formulaic. As a musical, it's at its weakest point, but it doesn't work as a rom-com either. I struggled to get through it."

1.0,the_young_girls_of_rochefort,"Simply charming, with Deneuve and Dorleac..."
0.0,the_young_girls_of_rochefort,A very disappointing musical from Jacques Demy - terrible story and boring songs. The costumes are farcical: trousers tucked into white boots? You can see the terrible glint of Xanadu in Gene Kelly's droopy eyes. Much better to watch Umbrellas of Cherbourg again.

1.0,crumb,"Tough to watch. It's not funny, but is a very good look at dysfunction."
1.0,crumb,"This is my favorite documentary ever. You don't have to know anything or want to know anything about Crumb to find this illuminating. This is the most tragic, f****d family ever in a movie, fiction or documentary. Crumb was saved by his art. Pretty uplifting film in the end."
1.0,crumb,probably my favourite movie of all time...demonstrates the line between genious and insanity
1.0,crumb,one of the best documentaries I've seen in recent memory

1.0,crumb,"Very enjoyable biopic, though I found myself more intrigued by Charles and Maxon than Robert."
1.0,crumb,"It wasn't the misogyny, depression, abuse, or strange sexual perversion that startled me - it was how cheerful Robert Crumb was about it. Now I'm even more convinced you need more than just talent to create great art - you need a twisted life-view too."

1.0,crumb,"a brilliant documentary on a brilliant mind......the end will depress you, however."

1.0,crumb,"Robert Crumb is a cartoonist and although he seems like a random choice for a documentary, he is in fact more interesting that the toons he has created. Whenever I watch this movie it is like I am seeing it for the first time and it it better everytime."
1.0,crumb,One of the most fascinating documentaries I have ever seen. An insight to the life and family of original comic artist Harry Crumb who is as odd as his art. Intense and fascinating I loved it
1.0,crumb,A very well made documentary. Features plenty of Crumb's incredible artwork and equally much of his incredibly crazy family.
1.0,crumb,One of the best documentaries I've seen. A common structure to one of the most bizarre artists in modern days. If you're a filmmaker this movie needs to be seen.

1.0,crumb,"A disturbing, fascinating peek into the mind of the greatest of all sequential artists."

1.0,crumb,"A real-life study of the fine line between genius and schizophrenia, one of the best American documentaries ever."
1.0,crumb,"an endlessly fascinating portrait of an endlessly fascinating guy. whenever i'm drunk and alone and feel belligerent, this is what i watch."
1.0,crumb,"man, this was amazing. I saw it at Film Forum when it came out. It's a sad trip down the black hole of debauchery of an incredibly tormented, talented artist.....and his brother with the string...well, what can I say? Like a car wreck, you can't look away. Really well done."
1.0,crumb,"Its a great documentary about a guy who draws chicks with GIGANTIC asses. Its hilarious, poignant, and sad all at the same time. His brother is actually more insane than he is, which after watching this film will show you, says a whole fucking lot."

1.0,crumb,"Great Documentary produced by David Lynch, which means its kick ass."

1.0,crumb,One of the best documentaries I've ever seen about anything ever.
1.0,crumb,"My all time favorite documentary. Robert Crumb is most definitely one f-ed up guy, but that only makes this movie all the more fascinating. And you thought your family was weird..."

1.0,crumb,Best documentary ever.
1.0,crumb,"Mesmerizing!  Of course, I knew OF Robert Crumb before seeing this flick but this movie really lets us into his world.  Uplifting, funny, outrageous and depressing all at once and in equal dose.  It's like a train wreck... you CAN'T turn away!"
1.0,crumb,"in the last two months I've probably watched/listened this movie 50 times. all anybody ever wants to talk about is how craaaazy his family is...which they are. they certainly are. Dov's revue puts it very well : ""The greatest perv who ever lived."" 'nuff said."
1.0,crumb,The only documentary i can watch again and again.
1.0,crumb,"awesome, very dark but revealing."
1.0,crumb,"I watch this movie at least once a year. Its fascinating, disturbing and inspiring. If you haven't seen it, you should. You might not like it... its not for everyone, but its worth seeing. My second most favorite movie."
1.0,crumb,On a short list with Hoop Dreams and The Thin Blue Line as one of the greatest documentaries ever made.
1.0,crumb,You can't make this $hit up. Best documentary ever.
1.0,crumb,the most remarkable portrait i've ever seen committed to film...
1.0,crumb,one of the best documentaires of all time.
1.0,crumb,Probably the best documentary I've even seen. I went in knowing very little of R. Crumb and came out with an interest in his work.
1.0,crumb,"One of the best documentaries I've ever seen. Funny, quirky, personal and tragic."
1.0,crumb,brilliant and somewhat disturbing. i couldn't stop thinking about this movie for a long time.
1.0,crumb,if you're easily offended this isn't for you but one of the most intimate studies of an original artist and the dysfunction that crystalized his vision.
1.0,crumb,Superb documentary about reclusive cult comic book artist Robert Crumb and the dysfunctional family he grew up in.
1.0,crumb,brilliant. one of the all time greatest documentary films ever made.
1.0,crumb,KEEP ON TRUCKING!! reat documentary about the underground comic book writer/illustrator Robert Crumb.
1.0,crumb,My favorite documentary. Fucking A+ soundtrack.
1.0,crumb,"""You know I like big LEGS and I cannot lie, Those other cartoonists can deny...""  Oh Crumb, you´re the daddy of comics. At least, youre a dad I wouldn´t feel uncomfortable talking to about sex."
1.0,crumb,Probably my favorite documentary. What an interesting character.
1.0,crumb,This and the Big Lebowski have the two most accurate visions of America that I've ever seen.
1.0,crumb,Brilliant unfolding of one kooky creative minds. One of the most entertaining docs ever.
1.0,crumb,"produced by David Lynch, a great window into family dysfunction"
1.0,crumb,Truly engrossing. Zwigoff's film is one of the best studies art as catharsis. So much to like.
1.0,crumb,Brilliant documentary into one the world of the world's weirdest guys...and his brother!
1.0,crumb,A really amazing documentary about a very questionably-behaving dude. But the material about his family is the most revealing.
1.0,crumb,"The first time I saw this documentary, I walked away feeling ashamed to be a man. Director Terry Zwigoff goes deep into the mind of artist Robert Crumb, pulling out some pretty remarkable, however disturbing thoughts on everything from american commercialism to the male psyche."
1.0,crumb,Great documentary about the life of perverse comic artist Bob Crumb. I don't see why everyone finds Crumb that strange. I wish I could say the same of his brothers. A classic.
1.0,crumb,i related to this movie because im also a pervert that had a traumatic childhood and i wanna be a famous artist just like crumb so i can get girls
1.0,crumb,"I ride the bus with people far less talented than R. Crumb, but just as creepy."
1.0,crumb,"Not everyone's cup of tea, surely, but props to Terry Zwigoff for not letting his friendship with Robert Crumb stand in the way of portraying the artist (and his dysfunctional family) warts and all, while still acknowledging his talent. This is documentary at its finest"
1.0,crumb,Hilarious. Very weird.
1.0,crumb,"a fabulous example of what can be done with documentaries. a wonderful movie if you're looking to feel down for a couple of days, but also a good ""at least my life is not as bad as that guys"" movie..."
1.0,crumb,"My favorite documentary of all time, a look into the sexually irreverent comic artist Robert Crumb. As you watch the film you learn that it's not Crumb that the movie is about but about how tame he is if you learn about his family, a shocking group of misfits (that's putting it lightly)."
1.0,crumb,this is one of my favorite documentaries of all time. it's hypnotic and sad and witty all in one.
1.0,crumb,"Fantastic biopic/documentary hybrid on perhaps the greatest artist of the 20th Century. If you've never heard of Robert Crumb, you're missing out. His life story is just as compelling, hilarious, and poignant as his work."
1.0,crumb,A powerful testiment to the salvation of art. Crumb is a genuis but even more compelling is the realization of just where he might of ended up if he couldn't exorcise his demons on the page. Amazing.
1.0,crumb,"Watched this in Intro to Psychology to understand abnormal psychology. To be brief this is about a family of three brothers where one's sexual object is his pen, the other's object is little boys, the other likes to molest woman. This movie brings you into their world."
1.0,crumb,"You think YOUR family's insane? It's a miracle we even heard of Robert Crumb at all, and I for one am glad we did."
1.0,crumb,"My favorite documentary. Whatever your opinion on R. Crumb's comics, you owe it to yourself to see this if you ever hope to have one iota of understanding concerning the creative process."
1.0,crumb,Um belo documentario sobre a vida do Robert Crumb.
1.0,crumb,Terry Zwigoff's unflinching documentary look at Robert Crumb is nothing short of mesmerizing.
1.0,crumb,"Great documentary on a n artist, curmudgeon, and survivor."
1.0,crumb,one of the best documentaries ever filmed. it's much too sad!
0.0,crumb,"pretty bad, although not bad enough to reiceve only half a star."
1.0,crumb,Un grandioso documental de uno de los mejores artistas del comic que han existido.
1.0,crumb,Legendary comic artist R. Crumb and his disjointed family.
1.0,crumb,Perhaps my favorite documentary.
1.0,crumb,Robert Crumb... I salute you!
1.0,crumb,"ispirational, and kind of scary"
1.0,crumb,I could watch this movie repeatedly.
1.0,crumb,Masterful portrait of the grandpappy of underground comics. After seeing this documentary Crumb's far-out comics don't seem quite so far-out!
1.0,funny_girl,This is amazing. It made me who I am
1.0,funny_girl,One of my all time favourite movies
1.0,funny_girl,Still one of the best.
1.0,funny_girl,Love love love love Funny Girl! Barbara Striesand! And my favorite song is Don't Rain On My Parade! Barbara Striesand is perfection!
1.0,funny_girl,A musical melodrama that soars as a staple in film history. Barbra Streisand's Oscar-winning performance as Fanny Brice is a must see for all fans of her and musical theatre.
1.0,funny_girl,"Streissand is outstanding in her first film - from the acting to the singing - it all works. Her comedic timing is perfect, and the film has held up nicely over time. I can even forgive the melodrama and the generic plot, because the screenplay and the music are invigorating."
1.0,funny_girl,"Finally watching this movie, I now have a new found respect for Mrs. Barbra Streisand. Her vocals represents true Hollywood!"
1.0,funny_girl,"Streisand is dazling and film is beautifully and vibrantly depicted. Not much of a comfort movie, but still worth the funny."
1.0,funny_girl,WHO LOVES BABS STRIESAND
1.0,funny_girl,One of my favorite movies of all time!!!
1.0,funny_girl,"As I was watching the movie, I fancied myself as Fannie Brice for a little bit and then....the movie ended and I came back to earth. This is Barbara at her best."

1.0,funny_girl,"Great, fine musical, gotta love Fanny Brice, charming."
1.0,funny_girl,It will always be my favorite movie...it will always be a piece of me!
1.0,funny_girl,Barbra Streisand's turn as Ms. Brice in this film and its on-stage counterpart became the vehicle for her shot to stardom and remains to be an ode to the talent she possess not only as a vocalist but as an actress. This is a classic for any underdog looking to be a star of any kind.
1.0,funny_girl,"Saw this movie for what was probably the 30th or 40th time tonight, but who's counting...Streisand is ""gowr-geous"" and timeless..."
1.0,funny_girl,id give it a million stars
1.0,funny_girl,"This movie is the vision of what a Ziegfeld dancer should be, Barbra Streisand does a WONDERFUL JOB!!! :)"
1.0,funny_girl,I thought it was great! Love Barbara!
1.0,funny_girl,I agree with Ebert that the rest of the movie just kind of sits there. But Barbra Steisand is so luminous in her first screen role that the rest of the movie really doesn't matter.
1.0,funny_girl,Barbra is a crazy bitch in this movie...i loved it! A+
1.0,funny_girl,"witty script, funny fanny, handsome sharif,wonderful music and all of it wrapped in beautiful costumes. barbara streisand is an icon."
1.0,funny_girl,"While funny girl is long and its second half ventures into melodrama, it is immensely charming and full of fanciful art direction and costume design, and Barbra Streisand's performance is one of the most perfect and memorable ever captured on film."
1.0,funny_girl,"Babs at one of her greatest performances. Funny Girl is one of the best musicals turned movie ever. Let the romance, drama and fun get into you as you watch Ms Straisand perform some of her biggest hits, like Don't Rain On My Parade."
1.0,funny_girl,[..] Don't rain on my parade [..] (love this song)Speechless ... Barbra is OUTSTANDING *_*Just ...
1.0,funny_girl,"funny,romantic and electrifying"

1.0,funny_girl,My favorite Streisand movie! She is incredible and the songs are so perfect...never was there a dull moment in this film (:
1.0,funny_girl,"This is a ""yes I can!"" biopic, with Streisand's zeal and down to earth appeal, magic vocal cords, and deliberate humor. Omar Sharif is magnificent as ever as Fanny's husband, and the production numbers are heartfelt and captures my attention and love."
1.0,funny_girl,"I forgot how much I loved this movie. This movie, I feel, best showcases Barbara's vocal ability. Especially with such memorable songs as ""People"", ""Don't Rain On My Parade"", and ""My Man"". Its definitely a classic!"
1.0,funny_girl,I never tire of watching Barbra Streisand in this magical musical about a woman in love with the wrong man all the while hungry for fame and fortune. Classic.

1.0,funny_girl,genialll!!!! hermossssaaaaaaaaaa!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,funny_girl,Amazing musical. Barbra Streisand is a diva.
1.0,funny_girl,"I fell in love with this movie after the first time I saw it. Streisand and Sharif make for an unforgettable duo. A sad ending, but realistic. This movie truly lives up to it's title, as it cushions the darker undertones with nothing short of comedic genious."
1.0,funny_girl,Striesand At Her Finest !! I Am Not A Huge Musical Fan But This Romeo And Juliet And Moulin rouge are My Top Faves :o
1.0,funny_girl,i loved this as a kid and i still love it to this day
1.0,funny_girl,"""What are you gonna do? Shoot the swans. These lovelys"""
1.0,funny_girl,"Not my cup of tea, but it was definitely a good film. I wish people would stop being so retarded with their ratings of films. We all have taste, but there's a lot more to life and especially art than just getting what you want. If Twilight deserves 4 stars, this deserves at least 4."
1.0,funny_girl,"There have already been times in my life when I've been performing, entertaining, or just plain living that I feel I'm living the Real Fanny Bryce story... And Steve is my flashy gambler willing to take a ""chance""... With me! lts"
1.0,funny_girl,i will never get sick of this film!
0.0,funny_girl,"So maybe it's just me, but ""Funny Girl"" really isn't funny. It's boring, and perfect fodder for trantransvestites. Watched 20 minutes of it, and am now watching ""The Blob!"" :)"

1.0,funny_girl,"Basically, this movie is amazing and so is Barbra Streisand."
1.0,funny_girl,I loved this movie! And I like the fact that not everyone ends up happily ever after.
1.0,funny_girl,"Don't judge Barbra till you see Funny Girl. Forget about her latter day musicals. If your looking for the definition of talent you will find it here. She blows the roof off with this performance! Comedy, drama, great music, a good story, everything is near perfect. You have to see it to believe it!"
1.0,funny_girl,"Iconic movie: the songs, the fashions, the sexy Omar factor. I don't even like Streisand (sorry) but this movie makes me wish she was a member of my family."
1.0,funny_girl,"This film had a HUGE impact on me; one of the reasons why I am a ""Funny Girl"" today...when you don't have the looks, you gotta use your brains and humor and STILL you meet a Nicky Arnstein and your heart gets pulverized in to Funny Girl paste...I will always be my own kind of Fanny Brice."

1.0,funny_girl,Barbra Streisand is fantastic in her Oscar winning performance. One of my favourite films.
1.0,funny_girl,Funny. Clever and True story! I Love Barbra!
1.0,funny_girl,why barbra is a star...
1.0,funny_girl,"The brilliance that is Barbra Streisand...it's kind of ridiculous. There will never be a talent comparable to her. Her delivery of ""My Man"" has been bored into my brain and soul for the rest of my life. She is a huge part of why I was inspired to be an actress."
1.0,funny_girl,Don't rain on my parade! Nuff said.
1.0,funny_girl,"Barbra at her best! A great soundtrack. It's a little slow in the second act, but the humor carries it."

1.0,sound_of_music,"Probably My Most Favourite Musical To Watch. I Have Seen This A Number Of Times & Just Get Lost In The Scernary & Music Everytime. Why Ever It Did Not Score More Oscars, I Guess It Needed Time, Like A Fine Wine, To Be Appreciated."

1.0,sound_of_music,Greatest movie ever!!
1.0,sound_of_music,My absolute favorite movie of all time! I can watch this over and over!

1.0,sound_of_music,Beautiful. Sensitive. Powerful. Epic.
1.0,sound_of_music,How can anyone find a single thing wrong with this. gorgeous from start to finish! If you've had a bad day have a sing a long with the Von Trapps!
1.0,sound_of_music,"Finally watched this glorious film right around the holidays. Yes after 23 years, I finally watched it. And boyyyyy was it a golden. Long, but just thoroughly enjoyable, and beautiful in every sense of the word, and in every aspect of the movie. Will be giving it many more viewings in the future."

1.0,sound_of_music,Definitely a high point for Julie Andrews.
1.0,sound_of_music,Casting is everything. These characters were made alive by the people who played them. The looks on their faces in certain scenes is so real and believable. The music and acting is the bench mark for me.
1.0,sound_of_music,Inspiring and wonderful Movie

1.0,sound_of_music,"This classic has been a favorite since childhood. The music, never grows old. Julie Andrews.... what can I say??"
0.0,sound_of_music,"There really should be a support group for the psychological damage inflicted upon children who had to sit through this awful thing because it was ""good for them"" at a point when they didn't have the power to just say no when their parents dragged them to see this atrocious thing."
1.0,sound_of_music,If your not familiar with musicals. . .this is where you can begin. Based on the True story of the Von Trap family who use great family music to escape Nazi occupied Austria.
1.0,sound_of_music,Classic - Love this movie.
1.0,sound_of_music,"Let's get to the point, Sound of Music is one of the best musicals I've seen. Julie Andrews had a high goal to meet after doing Mary Popins and exceeded that goal. The singing was wonderful and so was the acting. The kids were perfect and so was all the other cast."
1.0,sound_of_music,"I think that giving it a perfect five star rating is very acceptable. Sure, some say it might be cheesy, but it tells a very grand tale. One that has violence, romance, a certain contempt feeling to it, and of course singing. The Sound of Music should be able to last decades."

1.0,sound_of_music,Still great even in 2014!

0.0,muppet_movie,Wow. I saw the new Muppet movie and thought it was terrible- watched this one to compare it. This was slow and draggy and barely managed to keep my 2 yr old's attention. I must have been thinking of the Great Muppet Caper. Skip this one.

1.0,chicago,"Beautiful. Zeta-Jones and Zellweger are an amazing screen couple. Adorable performances, amazing songs and a great story, ""Chicago"" is one of the best musicals in the history."
1.0,chicago,This movie is actually far better than the musical. Catherine Zeta Jones brings Velma to another level
1.0,chicago,"It has a style and energy that could almost rival ""Moulin Rouge."" It has shining, exciting performances from an ensemble cast worth killing for. ""Chicago"" is a kicking, screaming good time full of brilliant music and fluid movement."
1.0,chicago,"Tirando a atuaÃ§Ã£o descartÃ¡vel de Richard Gere, direÃ§Ã£o e ediÃ§Ã£o geniais. O roteiro Ã (C) simples, mas isso nÃ£o Ã (C) necessariamente um problema, jÃ¡ que Ã (C) conciso e se trata de um musical."

1.0,love_and_mercy,"I didn't know anything about the Beach Boys or Brian Wilson before I watched this biopic. In many ways, it reminded me of 'Walk the Line', a biopic of another musician Johnny Cash. Great insight into the personal life of a pop culture icon."
1.0,love_and_mercy,Ties with Walk the Line as the best music biopic I've ever seen.
1.0,love_and_mercy,"You don't need to be a Beach Boy fan to find this movie mesmerizing. But once you see it, you'll want to check out some of those simple-seeming songs."
1.0,love_and_mercy,Paul Dano in Love and Mercy was a riveting and sensational performance showing the real journey and debilitating anxiety. It was a wonderfully told story that really shows the inside scope of the american music industry through the era. Another Must Watch
1.0,love_and_mercy,One of 2015 best films
1.0,love_and_mercy,Great movie. John Cusack was amazing.Showed a glimpse into his battle with mental health probems and his corrupt awful therapist.
1.0,love_and_mercy,"Full disclosure: I'm a huge, massive Brian Wilson fan so I definitely have a bias. However, this is a tremendous, powerful, touching movie. Dano & Cusack are nuts amazing. And if you are a fan of music, this movie should take you for a great ride."
1.0,love_and_mercy,"excellent movie about thr life and termulations of Brian Wilson, the genius behind the Beach Boys. such a sad movie, how much people were there just to manipulate him but how one lady Melanie was able to see through all the b.s. and get him the help he truly needed and fall in love with him."

1.0,love_and_mercy,"What a refreshing, innovate take on the tired biopic medium. Full marks for historical accuracy too - especially considering how painful Wilson's story really is."
1.0,love_and_mercy,"Love & Mercy carries as much soul as Wilson's music did. It does a tremendous job in showing the rise, the fall and the comeback of this great artist and gives us a unique look into the life of this star, brilliantly played by both Dano and Cusack"
1.0,love_and_mercy,"Excellent film about how mental illness comes from toxic people, the damage they cause. It felt so personal, like I lived it. That's what any excellent movie does."

1.0,love_and_mercy,A very insightful glimpse into the genius and mind of Brian Wilson. The sound for the movie was perfectly synched to the subject. A great love story. The empathy displayed by Elizabeth Banks makes me want to see more of her movies!

1.0,love_and_mercy,Great and emotional... On of my top 5 of 2015 so far
1.0,love_and_mercy,"The hard-hitting story of The Beach Boys' Brian Wilson, Love & Mercy is easily the strongest musical biopic in recent memory, thanks to impactful performances from Paul Dano and John Cusack, strong direction (featuring gorgeous cinematography and stunning sound mixing), and a tight screenplay."
1.0,love_and_mercy,A look at the insane world of musical genius.

1.0,love_and_mercy,The best movie of 2015. Extraordinary performances by Dano and Cussack.

1.0,love_and_mercy,"Loved it! Beautifully done, Paul Dano was superb as Brian Wilson."
1.0,love_and_mercy,The performances in this movie combined with a non-linear story line that's shown in a way that places you into the heart and soul of one of the most musically brilliant minds of all-time. Beach Boys albums set to repeat for the next month.
1.0,love_and_mercy,Loved this! Great acting by all. Paul Giamatti is particularly menacing!
1.0,love_and_mercy,"One of the best ""rock"" movies I have seen. I really didn't know Brian Wilson's story and John Cusack (ony of my favorites) was terrific although not looking on bit like Wilson. And of course.. . the wonderful songs!"
1.0,love_and_mercy,Great movie. Made you think. Superbly performed.
0.0,love_and_mercy,painful to watch. If you like spending 2 hours with a mentally ill person then this is the movie for you

1.0,love_and_mercy,May win the best movie award. So good
1.0,love_and_mercy,Although had to sit near a guy who kept telling his companions about the movie...I totally enjoyed the movie. Paul Dano & John Cusack were great. And why is Paul Giamatti so good at playing the jerk in this movie? Loved Elizabeth Banks as well.

1.0,love_and_mercy,Couldn't really talk about this movie for an hour afterward- the mark of a truly excellent sad film.
1.0,love_and_mercy,just as good as Jersey boys
1.0,love_and_mercy,Great performances all the way around. Good script. Innovative approaches take the audience inside the music and the man.

1.0,love_and_mercy,"Excellent acting! Sad story, I had no idea!"

1.0,love_and_mercy,Great movie. Story interpreted very well.
1.0,love_and_mercy,One of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. Not too many films make me cry but Love & Mercy made me cry twice. Paul Dano and John Cusack both take the cake for me. Both great portrayals of Brian. Very emotional driven. 2 thumbs up
1.0,love_and_mercy,A truly wonderful film. I'm just so happy that Brian Wilson lived to sing on.
1.0,love_and_mercy,"A great movie about Brian Wilson, his family, his musical greatness, and great music throughout the movie! A real winner! Bravo!"

1.0,love_and_mercy,Wonderful story of Brian Wilson. We loved it. Great acting. The cast was fantastic. Don't miss it
1.0,love_and_mercy,"All performances are great- Cusck was fourth best, and HE was amazing. Giammatti was terrifying as Eugene Landy; really menacing. Paul Dano is extraordinary as young Brian Wilson. If you like the Beach Boys, even a little, this is a must see."
1.0,love_and_mercy,"Easily one of the best rock biopics ever, at least, if not the best. LeeAnne and I saw Landy and Wilson at a movie theater in W. Hollywood when we were dating. Something looked off, just watching them together. Even if you don't care about the music or people, it's a fascinating film. Go see it!"
1.0,love_and_mercy,GREAT movie... Well-written; well-acted; well-directed; well-produced... one of the best movies I've seen in the last 5 years. Go see it. I expect some Academy Awards for this one.
1.0,love_and_mercy,"It's an amazing film that was intriguing at every moment, and sucked me in with every twist and turn. This film redefines the Musician Biopic genre and gives it a fresh, palatable sweet and bold flavor that will leave you feeling love. Fantastic!"
1.0,love_and_mercy,"Amazing. Sat through all the credits. Thoughtful, moving, entertaining."
1.0,love_and_mercy,One of the better thought out movies I've seen in a very long time. A great tribute to an amazing and talented person. Outstanding acting. Two thumbs way up.
1.0,love_and_mercy,Moving. Fame and wealth can't insulate you from mental illness and exploitation. Brilliantly acted. As good as it gets.
1.0,love_and_mercy,A fantastic biopic that gives great insight to the life of Brian Wilson. Paul Dano and John Cusack are exceptional at portraying Brian. Very well worth seeing!!!!
1.0,love_and_mercy,"WOW, insightful and heart touching."
1.0,love_and_mercy,"Very good yet very sad, I salut himâ?¨"
1.0,love_and_mercy,I really liked this movie... the acting is flawless and the story (true story) is just unbelievable how much of a genius Brian Wilson is.
1.0,love_and_mercy,Incredible performances and deeply moving film.
1.0,love_and_mercy,I didn't know that much going in....AND I WAS BLOWN AWAY. This movie has stayed with me for weeks and weeks. And has led to a Paul Dano other movie hunt by the way. This real story of Brian Wilson is at times hard to watch but ultimately most awesome.
1.0,love_and_mercy,"Great show. Perhaps a little hard on Eugene Landy, but not by much."
1.0,love_and_mercy,So good... So fucking good...
1.0,love_and_mercy,The best music bio ever made. This film is a high wire act...the jump cutting between decades using two different actors might have failed but instead it works to perfection.
1.0,love_and_mercy,I never realized that Brian Wilson was so talented and innovative.
1.0,love_and_mercy,This is a great movie. Brian definitely was a musical genius. The movie explores his life with his father as well as the Beach Boys. I highly recommend this movie for young and old. Brian and the Beach Boys will touch your heart.
1.0,love_and_mercy,"John Cusack and Paul Dano are amazing. Love, love loved it!"
1.0,love_and_mercy,"Great acting, great direction, great cinematography, great writing. A must see for anyone who likes music and especially the Beach Boys. Amazing attention to detail -- this is an extremely accurate bio-pic."
1.0,love_and_mercy,Inspiring and moving!
1.0,love_and_mercy,Just saw it. Bold and definitely unconventional . . . as is the subject Brian Wilson.
1.0,love_and_mercy,"Great acting by everyone, but John Cusak really stands out in his portrayal."
1.0,love_and_mercy,I was already in love with this film from the start - my love for The Beach Boys might have something to do with it - but I didn't expect something so artful. Love & Mercy is perfectly cast and is not afraid to take structural risks or even leap into 2001: A Space Odyssey territory.
0.0,love_and_mercy,Very slow movie. Nothing as I thought it would be.
1.0,love_and_mercy,Finding your true sanity is a spiritual experience and this very well represents how Brian Wilson accomplished it.
1.0,love_and_mercy,Best Movie of the year. Cross between Almost Famous and Birdman.. Brilliant and devastatingly dramatic. Tragic and Triumphant. Cusack nails it. All the actors do.
1.0,love_and_mercy,Beautifully made! Give a good listen to Pet Sounds and Smile and then go see this movie.
1.0,love_and_mercy,Just loved it!! Whish I had read a little more before going. Timeline not really shown but I guess was not relevant.
1.0,love_and_mercy,"Fascinating story ,difficult to tell but brilliantly scripted,crafted and acted by amazing cast."
1.0,love_and_mercy,Amazing portrayal of the great Brian Wilson! Very insightful into the world of mental illness and recovery. Very moving!
1.0,love_and_mercy,"Intense, complex and extraordinarily well done. Worth nominations for best picture, actor, actress, supporting actor, director, screenplay and even costume design. You will never hear the Beach Boys the same way again ."
1.0,love_and_mercy,Great movie about a gifted and sensitive man. Puts tears of joy and sadness in my eyes. Both Brian Wilsons are Oscar worthy.
0.0,love_and_mercy,biggest dissapointment ever. a waste of time
1.0,love_and_mercy,"A truly memorable movie, with amazing physical (body language) and emotional realism transferred to the screen from all types of underrated performers."
1.0,love_and_mercy,"For fans of Brian Wilson you will witness great acting portrayals of Brian and unique storytelling and editing. For everyone else, an intimate look inside a musical genius that has some psychological issues. Great movie!"
1.0,love_and_mercy,Phenomenal movie about Brian Wilson and his descent into mental darkness and eventual rise out of it with the help of his second wife. Paul Dano and John Cusick are amazing.
1.0,love_and_mercy,"One of the best movies in the past two years. Excellent screenplay, wonderful casting, great acting, and a moving (and true) account of Brian Wilson's challenges."
1.0,love_and_mercy,This is one of the greatest films I have ever seen.
0.0,love_and_mercy,"One of the worse and most boring movies I had to sit through, completely disjointed and totally ridiculous."

1.0,love_and_mercy,An absolute must see.
1.0,love_and_mercy,Beautiful story and important for clearer understanding of mental illness
1.0,love_and_mercy,Much more and less than you think you are going to get... Masterful performance by Dano and graceful filmmaking.

0.0,love_and_mercy,"This movie is slow, boring and terrible. Stay away if you're a Beach Boy fan. Hated it!"
1.0,love_and_mercy,"Emotional, happy, and intense at times its a great movie overall"
1.0,love_and_mercy,"The stellar cast delivers a moving performance in one of the best bio-pics to date. It breaks from the linear mold by switching from Beach Boy Brian to Brian the lost that gives great context to the rise, fall and redemption of one of music's greatest treasures."
1.0,love_and_mercy,"Brilliant! Audacious and loving treatment of the life and music of Brian Wilson. It''s hard to say who's the better Brian, Paul Dano or John Cusack. Each captures the genius, neorosis, and gentleness of Wilson in two very different times in his life."
1.0,love_and_mercy,"This is a wonderful movie that shows exactly the pains an artist goes through, even if he is only creating pop tunes, and though few have gone through what Brian Wilson has."
1.0,love_and_mercy,Great cast! Coming soon to a theater near you!

1.0,amadeus,Having the most beautiful set designs in movie history this period piece was nothing short of amazing with memorable performances by F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce. Milos Forman deserved the Oscar win for this one and so did the movie itself.

1.0,amadeus,"Witty, entertaining and never dull - Amadeus did not disappoint. I was expecting to see a film about Mozart, but this is as much a film about Antonio Salieri as it is about him. ""Amadeus"" is, at its core, about envy. ""Jealousy is a disease,"" has never been more true. Highly recommended."
1.0,amadeus,"A great film. A movie about one man seeking the revenge on the one who has the gift he believes he deserves, as well as one of the best films about music."
1.0,amadeus,I watched both the directors cut and the original and I would have to say the original is better than the cut.
1.0,amadeus,???? ???? ?? ??? ?? ?? ??? ??!
1.0,amadeus,"I was skeptical about if this movie would be good or not. I ended up loving this movie. F. Murray Abraham does a terrific job and I can see why he won the Oscar. You don't have to be a fan of music to be a fan of this movie. Great movie, everybody should watch."

1.0,amadeus,"Amadeus crescendos, decrescendos, speeds up, slows down, and is a masterpiece, just like one of Mozart's symphonies. The movie is almost perfect with the right balance of humor, drama, and even the scene length and cinematography is almost down to a science. Bravo, Maestro."

1.0,amadeus,became my favorite before I was legible to watch it.

1.0,amadeus,Ridiculously satisfying.
1.0,amadeus,i love the structure of this film. reminiscent of citizen kane and also seems to be an influence for the social network.
1.0,amadeus,"Little late to the party on this one (!) but, wow! 5 stars!"
1.0,amadeus,Perfect movie! Beyond brilliant performances! Tom Hulce and F. Murry Abraham were amazing!
1.0,amadeus,I have to say this was the best movie I have ever seen. Everything about it was perfect and I do not use that word loosely.
1.0,amadeus,My favorite movie of the eighties.
1.0,amadeus,La plus belle autobiographie du cinÃ (C)ma?
1.0,amadeus,BEST. MOVIE. EVER.
1.0,amadeus,One of my very favorite films.
1.0,amadeus,just simply perfect!
1.0,amadeus,"Beautiful, Artistic, Musical, Passionate and Perfect, Amadeus brings together a story told by a mad rival of Mozart's together ironically much like one of Mozart's operas. Flawless, Powerfully acted, directed, shot and edited. 100% Beauty of film. My favorite."
1.0,amadeus,"Finally got to see it! It was intriguing, and well worthwhile, and lovely to watch just to listen to the music :-)"
1.0,amadeus,"Amadeus has some of the greatest, most memorable scenes in cinema. Abraham gives one of the truly great antagonistic performances of all time."
1.0,amadeus,"""I will speak for you, Father. I speak for all mediocrities in the world. I am their champion. I am their patron saint."" - Salieri"
1.0,amadeus,"I'm stunned; absolutely adorable acting and a beautiful(but tragical) story, leading to one mans...revenge and victory. Awesome!"
1.0,amadeus,Milos Forman is a favorite director of mine and this is one of his best.
1.0,amadeus,Yeah 5 stars. You got a problem?
1.0,amadeus,"Casting Mozart as a horny, impetuous youth was daring albeit freshly comedic way of depicting God being smacked in the face (from Salieri's point of view, that is). The interplay between Hulce (Mozart) and Abraham was incredible - truly shaped up to be an opera of sorts encompassing all genres."
1.0,amadeus,The rivalry between Mozart and Antonio has never been matched in another film- ever.
1.0,amadeus,"I'm not usually one for stuffy period pieces, but this was great. It's got it all. Humor, jealousy, revenge, plot twists, and a sense of something big based on the subject matter of someone so historically important. Directors cut is a little long though."
1.0,amadeus,"One of the greatest of all time, Amadeus succeeds mainly due to phenomenal performances and a very witty script. Also, contrary to popular beliefs about the costume drama or period piece, this film is very entertaining and very funny!"
1.0,amadeus,One of the two Milos Forman masterpieces!
1.0,amadeus,"Dude, Mozart was a friggin' genius, even if he was a flake."
1.0,amadeus,"F Murray Abraham's performance alone is worth watching the film. Add to it Tom Hulce, the music, the costumes and the drama and Amadeus sinks deep into your heart. And it stays there."
1.0,amadeus,this is one of my all time favorite movies. i could watch it over and over. doesn't even bother me that its 3hrs long
1.0,amadeus,Un excellent film sur un des plus grand de l'histoire de la musique :D
1.0,amadeus,"New favorite movie! I really liked this because I can relate to Antonio Salieri who was poisoned and consumed by envy. Also, the operas within the movie were entertaining. Great actors, too."
1.0,amadeus,"One of the best movies I've ever seen. Great acting all around esp Mozart and Salieri, deep and epic story, all the sets and costumes were gorgeous. Full of satire and really funny moments. Friggin fantastico!"
1.0,amadeus,"I love the characters in this movie. Al are written and portrayed with heart and excellence. I especially love the ending to this movie, marking it as one of the best endings In my opinion. If you love Mozart or want to see a fantastic movie, this is for you."
1.0,amadeus,DAMN RIGHT!! 96%%%%%
1.0,amadeus,"This movie, when it was originally in the theaters, got me into classical music. I became a mozart fan after seeing this."
1.0,amadeus,the beginning is excellent.
1.0,amadeus,"One of the GREATEST Films, EVER Made! STUNNING!.. Just WATCH (Listen)!!.. AWESOME!.."
1.0,amadeus,"most awesome movie worthy of the best picture of the year 1984. this movie turned me to classical music. from here on it was NY Philharmonic, Metropolitan Opera and NYC Ballet. no one would believe that I love to see and hear all works of the classical music. wonderful... what a blessing!"
1.0,amadeus,amazing classical movie
1.0,amadeus,Bravo to one of the best films ever made.
1.0,amadeus,"Oh, the age inappropriate things I learned from this movie...."
1.0,amadeus,"A lavish, well directed film with two amazing leads in two amazing performances."

1.0,amadeus,Just one of those perfect films
1.0,amadeus,One of the best movies ever made.
1.0,amadeus,"""...where the smallest guys are putting out the flyest covers."""

1.0,amadeus,Holy shit................
1.0,amadeus,"an 80s classic,hulce & abraham are amazinglots of stunning costumes,and big sets"
1.0,amadeus,I loved Tom Hulce's interpretation of an irreverent Mozart.
1.0,amadeus,"While perhaps historically inaccurate, the movie is done quite artfullly. The decadence of the court (and Mozart) is eye-candy, the acting is fantastic, the music is wonderful, the scenery is lush. We see Mozart both as a man and as something tantalizingly divine."
1.0,amadeus,This picture is now part of my identity.
1.0,amadeus,It is a film that warns of the cost of jelousy and brilliantly executes charachterization and environment.

1.0,amadeus,One of the best films!! Milos Forman is one of the most gifted directors.
1.0,amadeus,This is like the most perfect film ever made.

1.0,amadeus,"A truly exceptional film which is funny, engaging, and has fantastic music."
1.0,amadeus,"This is such a brilliant, timeless piece of a movie. I think anyone that has played an instrument, sung, or enjoys music NEEDS to see this movie."
1.0,amadeus,"Oh mediocrity, behold the genius!"
1.0,amadeus,"Brilliant film and obviously superb soundtrack - Mozart's requiem is unbeatableOnly drawback is the American accent!!!And his laugh, which annoying is classic"
1.0,amadeus,"Some folks would say this movie is over rated. Well, not me! I LOVE IT! Great flick! Great acting, script, sets, picture AND costumes!"
1.0,amadeus,I completely forgot how great this film was. Thank god for instruments class.
1.0,amadeus,"OMFG!! pero que pelicula uff, se ha convertido en una de mis favoritas!!"

1.0,amadeus,It was the BEST musical movie that i have EVER seen.
1.0,amadeus,"Like Salieri said: ""sublime"""
1.0,amadeus,"really amazing, its a perfect movie with no flaws. this is one of my top ten favorite movies. its a masterpiece, such a genius story of envy. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"

1.0,amadeus,"Brilliant attention to detail, this film really took me out of my own life for three house. Brillirant acting, storyline, cinematography. Brilliant."
1.0,amadeus,"Fully brilliant. A sweeping, amazingly acted, perfectly tuned epic that bends history to its will to create something thematically strong and totally worthy of Mozart's music. Easily in my top 10 of all time."
1.0,amadeus,"While not faultless, this is an outstanding film and a true tribute to Mozart and to Music. The best compliment I can give it is to say that it bears repeated viewing, something which can be said of very few films."
1.0,amadeus,One of the best movies ever made.
1.0,amadeus,"One of the single best made films ever. Storytelling, production value, acting, writing, humor, drama, beautiful music, beautiful costumes. It's quite simply one of those films that's so perfect you can't imagine it any other way."
1.0,amadeus,Five stars... from a guy that rarely gives five stars.

1.0,amadeus,A real powerhouse of a movie. A biopic done right.

1.0,amadeus,Loved Mozart's exaggerated characterization! :D
1.0,amadeus,This is a beautiful film.
1.0,amadeus,"The directors cut on blu-ray adds even more to one of the finest movies if the 80s . Really is top drawer entertainment but if you're looking for bangs, violence or action thenThis is not it."
1.0,amadeus,They don't make movies like this anymore.
1.0,amadeus,F. Murray Abraham ... what a performance!
1.0,amadeus,"Screw Ray, Walk The Line, Dreamgirls, Hustle and Flow, etc. This is about real musicians."
1.0,amadeus,Just beautiful to watch.
1.0,amadeus,"Is it possible to give six stars?  NOTE: This review only relates to the theatrical cut. The director's version totally obliterates & ruins what was, to me, a perfect movie. It doesn't exist in my mind."
1.0,amadeus,"A sweeping vision with an outstanding feel for the era, this film is an unparalleled analysis of human nature at its most outstanding and its most terrible."
1.0,amadeus,"There is not much to say when it comes to my favorite movie of all time. I can honestly say I have never seen a movie so well done. You just need to see it to understand and the Director's Cut, with its 20 extra minutes, its a head above the original theatrical cut."
1.0,amadeus,"I love this movie so much. It hit me in a way that other movies hadn't hit me before. The performances and the music was all perfect, and everything blended together so well. This is my all time favorite movie."
1.0,amadeus,"sublime papá, sublime, y yo me hago llamar músico, ?? que focop."
1.0,amadeus,"Who is to know how these men really lived or the manner of their character. Forman dresses his characters with such detailed personalities, that I for one am willing to believe anything he presents as historical fact. Film making at its most magical."
1.0,amadeus,"Amadeus captured great elements of the past around the brilliant revolutionizing musician, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart."
1.0,amadeus,"favorite, nothing else to say"
1.0,amadeus,Redefines the word STUNNING...Supreme performances by F. Murray Abraham (as the patron saint of mediocrity) and Tom Hulce (a filthy genius)...A Sublime Score that is perfect in every way and a story that leaves the viewer spellbound...
1.0,amadeus,"Though not entirely accurate, Amadeus has great portrayals of character and hits its mark."
1.0,amadeus,"A fictional story about a great composer, full of charming and charisma, Milos forman's masterpiece is a Semi-bio, Semi-musical cinematic journey. The opening sequence is magnetic and brilliant,Mozart's symphony no. 25 is a great source for a score."
1.0,amadeus,Perfectly acted and directed film that make this one of the best films of the 80's.
1.0,amadeus,Chef d'oeuvres pur!!!!!!!! un des meilleurs films de tout les temps sur l'histoire d'un phénomène de la musique Mozart pour tout les fans de l'un des plus grands talents musicales un dons purs!! et requiem trop fort!!

1.0,american_in_paris,One of the best musicals ever made. Better then singing in the Rain. The Sound of Music and My Fair Lady are a close second
1.0,american_in_paris,One of Gene Kellys marsterpieces. I loved the 10 minute ballet sequence what a complex number but perfectly pulled off by Gene! :)
1.0,american_in_paris,Only I do not give six stars because there is not. This film is an authentic gem

1.0,american_in_paris,Gene Kelly and everyone else in this movie are classic and wonderful! It is a visual and musical piece of genius!
1.0,american_in_paris,"Title says a lot. A theatrical symphony that wasn't really adapted for film, but can definitely be appreciated for its budget even over time."
1.0,american_in_paris,It's beautiful...it's marvolous... that you should care for me!!!!
1.0,american_in_paris,Like a guitar or drum solo in a 70s psychedelic rock gig mixed with a Bogart film.

1.0,american_in_paris,"The art is incredible, and the Gershwin songs are as always genius The part that made this film stand out against all the other musicals other than great art and music is the final ballet. It's just a perfect example of Gene Kelly's brilliance."
1.0,american_in_paris,One of my favorite movies of all time!
0.0,american_in_paris,For dance enthusiasts only. There should've been a warning at the start!
1.0,american_in_paris,Gene Kelly doesnt disappoint in this one.. well he can never disappoint!
1.0,american_in_paris,"Gene Kelly, the music of George Geshwin and Paris....This movie musical is the second best of it's type! Add the very dry wit of Oscat Levant and the beauty of Leslie Caron.....This is a great movie!!"

1.0,american_in_paris,The best musical ever.Gene Kelly is amazing and the cinematography is great.
1.0,american_in_paris,"Gorgeous and wonderful. The final ballet climax is so great, it almost makes you forget the film reaches a resolution devoid of any real dramatic closure (there is never any confrontation between Gerry and Lise's other suitor.) Still, who really cares. This film is filled with beauty and joy"
1.0,american_in_paris,The ballet at the end merits five stars all by itself - it's gorgeous.
1.0,american_in_paris,this was really good....Oscar Lavant's character was hilarious....the last ballet was wow

1.0,american_in_paris,"It's paris, it's gershwin, it's kelly, it's caron, it's self-reflexivity, it's ballet, it's men dancing together half naked, it's romantic irony, it's in short a dream, and no director knew more about dreams and their power than vincente minnelli. perfection."
1.0,american_in_paris,Love the dancing. Love those old movies with Gene Kelly.
1.0,american_in_paris,This is an exceptionally wonderful old movie that I watched with my parents when I was growing up.

1.0,american_in_paris,"What a movie, the coreography by Gene Kelly is amazing!!! The music by Gershwin absolutelly excellent. Leslie Caron is also great and they both make a lovely couple. Why Hollywood can not do these movies anymore? I have seen it many times and everytime I see it I love it more and more."
1.0,american_in_paris,Stands in for all Hollywood musicals.
1.0,american_in_paris,This is my favorite movie! I love all the dances. And Gene Kelly!!!
1.0,american_in_paris,"this and Singin' in the Rain made me start loving the ""Classics"""
1.0,american_in_paris,The OTHER of the Top Two...fantastic... especially the suite at the end.
1.0,american_in_paris,"good, not as good as singing in the rain, bit songs are lovely and gene is as amazing as ever. I ve got rythm! and gershwin as a score writer... my god, who could ask for more..."
1.0,american_in_paris,"What is there not to like: Minnelli, Kelly, Caron, and Gershwin! It has a very 1950's era sensibility about male and female roles but I view that sociologically/historically."
1.0,american_in_paris,"Somehow the fact that is movie was made in the middle of the 20th century is important, I just haven't had time to figure out why! lol..... In musical cinema this is one of the most artistically modern in its dancing."
1.0,american_in_paris,Nothing is more classic than Gene Kelly in this movie
1.0,american_in_paris,"Gene Kelly romancing Leslie Caron in France is lovely, if unbelievable. And I love ""Stairway to Paradise."""
1.0,american_in_paris,This is one of my very favorite musicals -- though I admit when I re-view it I tend to skip ahead to the musical scenes...! I love the finale ballet.
1.0,american_in_paris,One of my favorite dancing musicals with the best in the business Gene kelly
1.0,american_in_paris,the best musical ever!!!!  absolutely
1.0,american_in_paris,Gene Kelly is supreme!
1.0,american_in_paris,good classic musical

1.0,american_in_paris,the stage set ups look like paintings
1.0,american_in_paris,"Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron are simply charming, and the film brings Gershwin to life."
1.0,american_in_paris,Some of the best dancing ever filmed.
1.0,american_in_paris,"Gershwin music set in Paris starring Gene Kelly - ""who could ask for anything more""?"
1.0,american_in_paris,"Its incredible, but characters are difficult to like..."
1.0,american_in_paris,"This is musical comedy perfection. Gene Kelly is as smooth as silk, Oscar Levant is genius, Leslie Caron is toothy and Gerswhin is God."
1.0,american_in_paris,"Teast of the Good of Paris, dances, Love and views o Paris. Music that will ever last."
1.0,american_in_paris,Ultimate escapist fantasy set in Bohemian Paris. .My favourite musical
1.0,american_in_paris,enjoyable. The ballet sequence was phenomenal. I liked watching that part because it told a story.
1.0,american_in_paris,this really is a ballet.
1.0,american_in_paris,Quintissential Gene Kelly. Reminds me of why I performed.
1.0,american_in_paris,"A delightful fantasy. One of my favorite films. Luscious score by Gershwin. The very talented Gene Kelly. The unforgettable songs S'Wonderful, Stairway to Paradise and I Got Rhythm."
1.0,american_in_paris,"Always loved dance- and musicfilms, Gene is a genious! Fantastic decors and choreography, they do not make them like this any more."
1.0,american_in_paris,oh la la those were the days
1.0,american_in_paris,Love the music and watching this movie makes me want to run to the ariport and fly off to Paris.
1.0,american_in_paris,Gershwin al piano + Gene Kelly en escena + Vicente Minelli dirigiendo = Mi musical favorito.
1.0,american_in_paris,"To me far superior than Singi'n In The Rain, much more artistic and ambitious. Plus the Gershwin doesnt hurt either. Kelly is at his peak, artistically and most of in the choreagraphy. The highpoint of the MGM machine."
0.0,american_in_paris,This probably worked in 1951 by now - Dead boooring... the dance scene in the end lasts fooooreeveeer and is most likely choreographed by a Gene on Absinthe.
1.0,american_in_paris,Gershwin meet Kelly could not go wrong. Awesome movie!
1.0,american_in_paris,He's simply fantastic in the Toulouse Lautrec dancing and when dancing and singing with the children at the beginning. Lovely one.
1.0,american_in_paris,"I'm a Gershwin&tap-dance; fan, so this is a special movie for me, just like ""singin in the rain"" .."
1.0,american_in_paris,Extraordinary dancing in this movie.
1.0,american_in_paris,"My favorite musical ever. Gene Kelly's dancing alone in ""I Got Rhythm"" makes the movie. The music is all Gerswin and all perfect."
1.0,american_in_paris,Of all the great MGM musicals this is the one I return to over and over again. Fantastically imaginative choreography and a beautiful Gershwin score.
1.0,american_in_paris,My favorite Gene Kelly movie. I love how Kelly's modern dance juxtaposes with Leslie Caron's classical ballet.
1.0,american_in_paris,"It has its lengths, the plot gets occasionally creaky but the music, the choreography, the ambition make this an outstanding musical. When Hollywood's fake versions of places were so great it didn't matter they weren't the real thing."
1.0,american_in_paris,Oh..this was a great movie..I enjoyed every piece of it specially the dance and the paris scenery
1.0,american_in_paris,gene kelly is the master of this genre. with good looks to boot. the sets are brilliant. the choreography still modern to this day. a must-watch for any musicals fan.
0.0,american_in_paris,"This is precisely the kind of syrupy, bloated junk 70's cinema rebelled against."
1.0,american_in_paris,This is one of film's greatest works of art. It's a fantastic film that everyone should watch. The picks from Gerswin were perfect!
1.0,american_in_paris,"This movie was really good! It has great songs in it, and of course, famous dance numbers."

1.0,american_in_paris,I love this film as well! Gene Kelly is awesome in it and I love the music!
1.0,american_in_paris,One of my all-time favorite movies.
1.0,american_in_paris,"Okay, I'm a Gene Kelly/ Dancing Junkie. He's brings so much life into the film. Great song and dance numbers. Lesie Caron was probably his best dance partner in a movie. There is a 17-minute ballet number which is fantastic!"
1.0,american_in_paris,"gene kelly and leslie caron, what more can you ask for!?"
1.0,american_in_paris,One of the best movies ever. I'm a big Gene Kelly fan. One of thos feel good movies that stays with you.

1.0,american_in_paris,"Everyone says ""singin in the rain"" is the best flim, me it all about the last 20mins of this film, Genius !! all this and Leslie Caron too"
1.0,american_in_paris,it's gene kelly; he's the best
1.0,american_in_paris,Gene Kelly was so amazing in this movie that he killed romance. No one else could ever be this fantastic ever again.
1.0,american_in_paris,quite easily one of the best mgm musicals ever made. ahead of it's time though a little dated now it's musical masterpiece

1.0,american_in_paris,As years go by I like this movie more and more.
1.0,american_in_paris,gene kelly = 5 stars
1.0,american_in_paris,"If this film proves nothing else, it proves that telling Gene Kelly he can't actually film in Paris just pisses the man off and he makes the best frickin musical ever filmed to spite you.  Seriously, Gershwin, Kelly and Caron. You'd have to work HARD to make some thing bad out of that."
1.0,american_in_paris,oh gene kelly.. *swoon*

1.0,american_in_paris,This is absolutely splendid. I loved every minute of it!
1.0,american_in_paris,"I really loved the beauty and scale of this old MGM pearl, I'd just have wished that the Arthur Freed guy was still alive today to make such beautiful music. They don't make these films anymore ;)"

1.0,amy_2015,"The best documentary I've ever seen! ""I DONT THINK IM GOING TO BE AT ALL FAMOUS, I DONT THINK I COULD HANDLE IT, I PROBABLY GO MAD"" - Amy 2003. ""IF I COULD GIVE IT BACK, JUST TO WALK DOWN THAT STREET, WITH NO HASSLE, I WOULD"" - Amy 2011."

1.0,amy_2015,It was like watching a Shakespearean tragedy. Amy is a Jazz genius surrounded by they superficial and musically inferior minded.
1.0,amy_2015,What a great talent. So sad how the paparazzi hounded her. This film was a glimpse at how difficult her life was when she became truly famous. I think her husband and her father were both leeches and only cared about getting money from her.

1.0,amy_2015,"A very good but sad documentary about a great singer and misunderstood person by some. She had her problems like a lot of us do, and with the fame and mental issues she did struggle. I highly recommend watching this though, a great watch."
1.0,amy_2015,An exploited genius showcasing the highs and extreme lows of her life and how her mental imbalance and class of people around her led to the sad inevitable
1.0,amy_2015,Much Better Than I Expected. Such Genius Artist With Such Troubled Demons
1.0,amy_2015,Poor Amy :( Her father was a jerk. Her boyfriend was a jerk. Too bad the good folks in her life couldn't influence her more. She rose too fast and couldn't deal with the pressure of fame. Good doc showing how vulnerable Amy was and thats where her artistry and soul came from.
1.0,amy_2015,"Intense, emotional, profound, depressing but very beautiful portrait."
1.0,amy_2015,Such a sad story. I have much more respect and admiration for her and her career after watching. Highly recommended.

1.0,amy_2015,"A classic tale, brilliantly told, of the tortured artist who detests fame and is ultimately killed by the demand her genius created. Heart breaking."
1.0,amy_2015,awesome touching & moving at least me 2 tears she was such a talent.
1.0,amy_2015,Great insight on her life and how those closest to her took advantage and allowed her to abuse drugs for their own selfish reasons.

1.0,amy_2015,heartbreakingly beautiful amy winehouse and biopic both. fragile genius sucked dry by those who aim to get their share of her while she lasted. childhood father trauma steers her course in life and it is so very sad. great film.
0.0,amy_2015,"Can't believe this received so many high ratings. The documentary makes it look like Amy was the victim in her own drug abuse and alcoholism when the choice was always hers. If I wasn't with my girlfriends family watching it, I would have shut it off after the opening credits."
1.0,amy_2015,"It only took me two hours to feel the same loving feeling for this beautiful disaster as if she were my own sister. She was a troubled soul simply yearning for paternal love; unfortunately the two people that should've given it to her (bf/dad) were the two most corrosive substances she ever ""used."""
1.0,amy_2015,"Absolutely tragic. A damaged soul being allowed, and more than not pushed, by the people who should love her the most to continue a self abusive road to basically suicide. Her parent and husband at the time should be ashamed and reap what they sowed."
1.0,amy_2015,Documentary really humanizes a truly gifted and one of a kind performer.. I hope people will think twice for making a troubled celebrity or anyone for that matter the butt of jokes and ridicule. Best music documentary in a long time if not ever

1.0,amy_2015,"The best documentary film of 2015, and one of the year's best films!"

1.0,my_architect,Excellent documentary
1.0,my_architect,Who knew a documentary could be so touching?
1.0,my_architect,"un documental muy conmovedor y muy bien hecho del hijo de Louis Kahn... y como documental como tal, plantea una pregunta. muestra la busqueda y la responde... ya uno como arquitecto disfruta del chisme alrededor del arquitecto como tal."
1.0,my_architect,Simply done but simply spot on. I have wanted to watch this movie for some time and I was very impressed about this personal and honest journey of a son in search for his gifted but imperfect father who has been dead for over 25 years.
1.0,my_architect,I'm almost sure I'll never get sick of this movie. It's first on my agenda once break starts.
1.0,my_architect,Majestic architecture becomes the emotional landscape for a director who is desperate to know his absent father.

1.0,my_architect,unbelievable family-story. unbelievable architecture.

1.0,my_architect,Awesome movie! Inspirational indeed.
1.0,my_architect,"A personal favorite that inspires me everytime I see it. Louis Kahn is man of such genius and strife that it's difficult to explain him in a touching, yet not mushy way. Nathaniel Kahn succeeded in doing so."
1.0,my_architect,Amazing and inspiring movie. Some moments are full of sadness and loneliness which clearly shows how architect suffered from sacrificing his life in favour of art.

1.0,my_architect,i loved this docu.mezmorized by the beautiful architecture and strange life of the designer...
1.0,my_architect,This is the movie that confirmed my interest in architecture. I love it!
1.0,my_architect,I m a fan of Louis Kahn's work.. n d documentary is awesome..
1.0,my_architect,"A wonderfully touching documentary about life, family, loss and forgiveness. Louis I. Kahn might have left us some great buildings but he also spawned an excellent film-maker/ storyteller in his son, Nathaniel. Highly recommended."
1.0,my_architect,"This movie made me cry... in a good way. When that old man on the boat realizes that Nathaniel is Louis' son and breaks down... uh, breaks my heart... it makes me hurt for all the broken families in this world and all the children who don't know their father..."
1.0,my_architect,Heartbreaking study of the holes people can leave in others.
1.0,my_architect,"A beautiful documentary, dealing with themes both artistic (the purpose of architecture) and personal (should a man be judged by his work or by his personality). Intelligent, thought-provoking, and suprisingly entertaining."
1.0,my_architect,"Best documentry ever!!! My Architect is about Louis Kahn, the architect who designed The Capital Of Bangledash building in India. This documentry reveals the shattered families he left behind. He had three affairs and a few illegitimate children. Great buildings and a wonderful movie in summary."

1.0,fantasia,"Disney's true masterpiece!Without Fantasia, the music would be difficult to use for inspiration.Plus there's a splendid combination between live-action (hence the orchestra) and animation; Mickey Mouse shaking hands with the music conductor (epic!)"
1.0,fantasia,Excellent. Top-notch animation that's very vibrant and bursting with life that goes perfectly with the associated musical numbers.
1.0,fantasia,Music and magic:) I particularly enjoyed the Schubert piece.

1.0,fantasia,one of my favorites. this was all done before CGI
1.0,fantasia,"Stunning and beautiful animation matches the music perfectly. While there is no concrete narrative, Fantasia doesn't need one as it is more along the lines of an experience than a traditional movie. An experience, I believe, that shouldn't be missed by any fan of animation or orchestra music."
1.0,fantasia,"Marvelous animation and wonderful music, a lovely mixture of the two"
1.0,fantasia,"Even at 71-years-old, Fantasia is a unique artistic experience that has yet to be properly duplicated. Walt Disney's one time failure has proven to be one of his biggest successes."

0.0,fantasia,"Not a fan. I dont see how its a good movie to watch. I dont know of any person who would even consciously say, hey you know what i havent seen in a while? Fantasia, lets do that to ourselves. Never. Blarghaflargh"
1.0,fantasia,I personally loved this film. I don't think you will enjoy on bit of it if you don't like artwork or music. I loved how they associated the film/ artwork in the same rythym with the music being played. It really bridged the gap between art and music.
1.0,fantasia,Chernabog (Satan) is the most compelling character of the entire film.
1.0,fantasia,Great visuals and Music 5 out of 5
1.0,fantasia,"I really liked this movie, because it is just great and soothing to listen to like it will always but you in a good mood. Also the colors and pictures are very cool too! They use classical music for this movie, like Bach. The first song they play gets kind of aggressive then goes soft."
1.0,fantasia,"Fantasia may not have any dialogue, but I have a feeling that that is what makes it great. The animation is over its head for the 1940s, and the music that accompanies the sequences is charming. This one is still perfect in my book."

1.0,fantasia,"This is, by far, one of Disney's best films of all time."
1.0,fantasia,"It's been said that Fantasia isn't as good for kids as much as it is for adults and nerdy kids. It's defiantly an acquired taste but never the less Fantasia is beautifully made movie with a unique strategy of storytelling, and in my opinion it is the best Disney movie ever made."
1.0,fantasia,This is the closest thing I've seen Disney do that transcends animation into the realm of art. It's real food for the soul stuff. And all of its small failures seem only to add shading and depth to the over all exquisiteness of the film.
1.0,fantasia,The best animated musical ever.
1.0,fantasia,Best Film when I was a child. This is just amazing
1.0,fantasia,music with visual effects in perfect harmony
1.0,fantasia,"An original, inventive, imaginative and creative experience that, found in only a handful of films, allows audiences to create their own interpretations of the images on screen and turn them into meaning. Beautiful, colourful and brilliant, its one of the first exercises in excess movies released."
1.0,fantasia,"Disney's best. It surprises me why films like 2001 and Fantasia (films with little dialogue) aren't common. I know audience have come to except speech in film, but the music gets by so much more and is fantastic."
1.0,fantasia,Ok...we need it with a new full digital recording.We also need another Fantasia in full 3d
1.0,fantasia,"A beautiful, colorful, animated movie with lovely music and excellent animation. 5 out of 5."

1.0,fantasia,"Definitely my favorite movie next to The Wizard of Oz, Fantasia has the sound and picture that captures audiences of all ages. With music pieces like The Sorcerer's Apprentice, The Dance of the Hours, and Ave Maria, this film is indeed one of Disney's best motion pictures if not the best."

1.0,fantasia,"Truly an original form of animation, one not dependant on funny dialogue or well known voice over talent, but simply a wonderful blend of classical music and an interpretation of that music through animation.

1.0,hairspray,it's the only movie that Christopher Walken actually does right
1.0,hairspray,"I love this film. It encourages positive body images and deals with serious negatives issues of the 60s, such as racism and mixed race relationships. The songs are catchy and upbeat, the lines are funny, I LOVE THIS FILM."
0.0,hairspray,"I was so embarrassed for John Travolta watching this, even Christopher Walken shouldn't have touched it with a barge pole. What sort of low must Travvo have reached to accept this job? It's pretty cringeworthy as most musicals are but without Travolta trying to be Divine it may have been watchable."

1.0,hairspray,It is an amazing movie and I love the outfits / costumes.
0.0,hairspray,"This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I am completely puzzled by positive reviews. What can be said about a movie in which John Travolta plays a fat woman with a high pitched voice? In spite of this movie, nobody wants to see a fat girl dancing. Let's just be honest."

1.0,metallica_some_kind_of_monster,ONE of the best documentaries EVER!!!!
1.0,metallica_some_kind_of_monster,St. Anger was one of the biggest mistakes in music history. But it's still very interesting to see how the world's greatest metal band of all time operates in the studio.
1.0,metallica_some_kind_of_monster,"An in-depth look at the issues behind one of the greatest rock bands ever. You'll love Rob, hate Lars, appreciate James and wonder what on earth is Kirk, you'll understand why St.Anger is the heaviest album they ever made... and something more inthe bargain."
1.0,metallica_some_kind_of_monster,I'm with Michael on this one...I wouldn't make you do a drum solo if your arm fell off.

1.0,metallica_some_kind_of_monster,"WATCH! The greatest thrash metal band fight with themselves. SEE! How they hire a therapist so they can stop fighting. LISTEN! As they create their new album, St. Anger (which by the way, sucks).  But in all seriousness, this is a funny and downright awsome movie."
1.0,metallica_some_kind_of_monster,"As far as documentaries go, this one's pretty incredible. The DVD comes with a lot of scenes that didn't quite make the cut - and they're all great. A common complaint, probably, is that their therapist was generally lame - but this doesn't take away from the awesomeness of the product."
1.0,metallica_some_kind_of_monster,"A bitter tale of rejection, drugs, and anger. A bit like your average Metallica album."

1.0,u2_3d,"I only saw two movies in 3D (this and 'Up'), but 'U2 3D' is not only the great film that I saw in 3D: is a sensorial experience. I WANT IT IN DVD!!!!!!!!!!"
1.0,u2_3d,"I do believe this is actually the closest I have ever gotten to having a religious experience. Ever. Never mind the 3D aspect, the amazing shots that these cameras captured were unique for absolutely any concert footage I have ever seen. Amazing. Amazing! I want this on DVD so freaking bad."
1.0,u2_3d,"Alright, I'm a U2 fan. Okay, now you know that, let me tell that 'U2 3D' is an amazing, emotive and unforgettable film. Is pure U2, so, if you like music, you have to experience this. You'll love it. P.S.: THE BEST USE OF 3D I EVER SEEN IN A MOVIE!"
1.0,u2_3d,Brilliant ! One of the Best experince for life. Words cannot explain the excitement. When Bono reach you his hand you feel that he will really grab your hand. Even better than the real thing!.
1.0,u2_3d,wow!!!! que recuerdos y que buena forma de estar en un concierto!!!!!
1.0,u2_3d,I usually can't sit through a film more than once. Found a reason to see this already 3 times over the last year. Gotta read the wikipedia article on how this came together..
1.0,u2_3d,"Larry Mullen Jr. in 3D!!!! :D :DYou can almost play the drums!You can play the bass with Adam Clayton! :D :DA very beautiful experience, if you love rock music and/or U2... GO TO SEE IT! :))))"
1.0,u2_3d,I could almost feel Bono sweating on us! Amazing!!!!
1.0,u2_3d,Incredible music. Amazing 3D technology.
1.0,u2_3d,Saw it in IMAX 3D format Simply amazing!
1.0,u2_3d,"After seeing Coraline in 3D, I felt compelled to brag that I saw this--the coolest fucking 3D movie EVER. *This* is what all 3D films should aspire to be."
1.0,u2_3d,amazing concert! seems like I was actually at that concert and enjoyed with the crowd there:D started to like U2 even more:P
1.0,u2_3d,Insane! Enjoyed every second of a movie!!
1.0,u2_3d,"One of the best concert film experiences I've ever had in a theatre. Great performances, uplifting music. Still the best band on the planet."
1.0,u2_3d,"This movie was freakin' insane! I've never been to a real concert, but now I definitely want to go! What an experience ! ~WOW~"
1.0,u2_3d,Seen it 4 times and still want to see it again!!AWESOME SHOW...just like being there again.Go see it...
1.0,u2_3d,"Joj sto volim ovaj koncert a jos u 3D izdanju, taman da ih taknem dok mi plesu ispred ociju :D nadam se da ce i drugi bendovi slijedit njihov primjer *khm.... rhcp!*"
1.0,u2_3d,Very cool! U2 rocks!
1.0,u2_3d,"I was amazed at how they filmed the concerts from so many angles. Sometimes they even mixed 2 3D images together, so it was 6D. :)"
1.0,u2_3d,OdliÄ?an doÅ¾ivljaj koncerta! Ako ikad doÄ?u u Hrvatsku definitivno Ä?u ih iÄ? gledat uÅ¾ivo! SviÄ?a mi se poruka koju prenose ljudima.
1.0,u2_3d,"Joj sto volim ovaj koncert a jos u 3D izdanju, taman da ih taknem dok mi plesu ispred ociju :D nadam se da ce i drugi bendovi slijedit njihov primjer *khm.... rhcp!*"
1.0,u2_3d,"Amazing, you take the best band in the world, and surround them with 3d cameras...some cool stuff is gonna happen."
1.0,u2_3d,FREAKING AWESOME!!!!!!!!U2 are amazing!!!!!!
1.0,u2_3d,Trop malade. On a vraiment l'impression d'etre sur le stage avec les membres de U2. On rescent pleinement l'emotion et la puissance du band live. Le choix des chansons est excellent malgrÃ© le manque de quelques succÃ¨s du groupe.
1.0,u2_3d,Saw this at an IMAX theater. Convinced it was as good to being there as it gets. Rock on U2.
1.0,u2_3d,Great showcase of what U2 is about...
1.0,u2_3d,Wow - wow... the only word to describe it... WOW!
1.0,u2_3d,The ULTIMATE 3D Imax experience !I wish I could have it on my HDTV. Perfect visual and sound experience... It's a BEAUTIFUL DAY !!!
1.0,u2_3d,"Though I'm highly biased, as a huge U2 fan, but it was an excellent concert film- it definitely captured the ambiance and feel of their concerts. It was excellent!"
1.0,u2_3d,"I liked it a lot ! I dont go to shows because I dont like crouds, so for me it is a great way to see shows, and less expensive !"
1.0,u2_3d,"This was AWESOME! I thought I'd be so bored, but I was beyond entertained. It actually felt like you were in the middle of a concert, and the music was amazing. I wish I could see it again, but obviously there's no way to recreate it unless it's in a 3D theater again."
1.0,u2_3d,The Edge in 3D...I'm speechless.
1.0,u2_3d,"Not just a great concert, but a great movie, too!"
1.0,u2_3d,If you like U2's music then this is a must see. Feels like you are actually in the concert.
1.0,u2_3d,Spectacular!!! The Edge was amazing.
1.0,u2_3d,Arguably better than actually being there. Nothing special about the actual performance (just typically awesome live U2) but the 3D effect and cinematography are amazing. Enjoyable if you aren't a u2 diehard.
1.0,u2_3d,"It was breathtaking. Bono, The Edge, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen, Jr were so close to us, so unbelievable! There were times that I wanted to sing, dance and shout with the concert audience but itâ??s a 3D movie so I just stayed seated and sang silently! :)"
1.0,u2_3d,"F*&king; Groundbreaking!!! 3D IS UNREAL! What a change from my youth of 14 years watching Jason in Friday 13th 3D..This is like being on the stage with U2, better than being there in pe3rson, you better believe it!!!!"
1.0,u2_3d,"Wow! If you ever get a chance to see this... it's incredible! I'm not even a huge U2 fan and I saw it 5 times in the theater. From what I hear, they aren't even planning on releasing it on DVD."
1.0,u2_3d,"Astonishing. The concert is terrific, the music is thrilling, but the real news here is the 3-D filmmaking. We're seeing the birth of a new medium here. A landmark film."
1.0,u2_3d,unforgettable fire:)
1.0,u2_3d,Absolutely fantastic. This is as close as I'll ever get to my boys.
1.0,u2_3d,I've seen them live 6 times and this blew me away. I felt like I was one with Bono. Amazing effects.
1.0,u2_3d,"Not the biggest U2 fan, but this movie is impressive, I was luck to see the real 3d movie and i still cant close my mouth!!! i'm stunned"
1.0,u2_3d,Brilliant ! One of the Best experince for life. Words cannot explain the excitement. When Bono reach you his hand you feel that he will really grap your hand. Even better than the real thing!.
1.0,u2_3d,Absolutely brilliant especially if you saw the vertigo tour. Only problem was that it didn't go for long enough.
1.0,u2_3d,"Better than being there - I saw this tour in Boston and it was great, but this movie made me experience it like I never could in real life. AWESOME."
1.0,u2_3d,"Possibly one of the best things if you can't get to the concert. The concert is incredible and the 3D effects never distract, but enhance the whole experience. If you are a fan of U2, you owe it to yourself to go see this movie!"
1.0,u2_3d,"Uno, dos, tres, catorce!!"
1.0,u2_3d,Best concert film ever!
1.0,u2_3d,Absolutely AWESOME!!! nuff said!
1.0,u2_3d,Amazing 3D concert that glows with intensity
1.0,u2_3d,Un seul mot : AMAZING !!!!
1.0,u2_3d,"OUTSTANDING! The camera shots, the 3D effects that I believe are new to the industry and the sound was kick. Great selection of the best songs from a excellent band!"
1.0,u2_3d,Unbelievable.....I'm speechless. :-)
1.0,u2_3d,Sensational. As good as being there except this time I remember it all.
1.0,u2_3d,One of the best concert films I've ever seen.
1.0,u2_3d,"finally, a 3-d movie where the technology makes sense."
1.0,u2_3d,amaing better than been a actual gig
1.0,u2_3d,"Son lo mas grande que hay, y como no podia ser de otra forma esta peli rockea! Bono te mira a ojos y parece q te canta exclusivamente a vos!!! un sueño para cualquier Fan!"
1.0,u2_3d,"Amazing, it really feels like if you're there. Wow, simply wow"
1.0,u2_3d,"Nach diesem film , liebte ich u2"
1.0,u2_3d,I loved this! It felt you were standing on the stage with them.
1.0,u2_3d,ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!
1.0,u2_3d,"Brilliant! I didn't know what to expect from a 3d concer movie but it was just like being on stage with Bono & co. When he reached out his hand during ""Sunday Bloody Sunday"" singing ""wipe your tears away"" I was utterly mesmerised."
1.0,u2_3d,friggin' awesome. go see it.
1.0,u2_3d,Really REALLY good. Wish it was longer!
1.0,u2_3d,It's like a lap dance from Bono!
1.0,u2_3d,Amazing! It was like I was the only one in the room and Bono sings directly to you! :)
1.0,u2_3d,OMG!!! The best thing i have EVER seen!!!
1.0,u2_3d,"Because I love U2, I have to say that this was the greatest documentary/concert video I have ever seen. It blew my mind."
1.0,u2_3d,Bellissimoooooooo...sei sul palco proprio li' in mezzo a loro. a tratti si sfiorava la mano di Bono!
1.0,u2_3d,Amazing!! I'm sure you've never seen anything like it. As close to Bono as you'll ever get :)
1.0,u2_3d,The closest I'll get to the real thing!
1.0,u2_3d,Toda una experiencia nueva para mí el cine 3D y nada mejor que vivir un recital así
0.0,u2_3d,Even if they were in 4D you couldn't drag me along to see this.
1.0,u2_3d,esto es el futuro del cine. increible tecnologia que hace que sea casi mejor que ver el recital en vivo.
1.0,u2_3d,"I am a huge fan and the 3ality effect is extraordinary. If you love U2, see it."
1.0,u2_3d,Absolutely incredible.  SH
1.0,u2_3d,SO-FUCKING-AMAZING!!!!
1.0,u2_3d,Klassic Feels like you were right there watching the gig A Must for all U2 Fans
1.0,u2_3d,"Mind blasting! You'll smile, you'll cry and you'll clap your hands if you don't stand up! Go see it!"
1.0,u2_3d,"Great band, great music. Wished it was longer but the 3D technology is very cool."
1.0,u2_3d,Unbelievable. Even if you're not that big of a fan you will be nothing but thrilled by the combination of imagery and music that will blow you out the back of the theatre. Not just a movie - it's an experience!
1.0,u2_3d,the best movie I've seen
1.0,u2_3d,surreal experiance. felt like your either part of the crowd our part of the band and crew
1.0,u2_3d,Excelente show con icónicas canciones de U2. El 3d es impresionante a veces uno se siente sobre el escenario.
1.0,u2_3d,this rocks if you like U2 you will love this it felt like you are at the concert
1.0,u2_3d,So good. So so good! Never been SO CLOSE to a concert in my life. Did I say how good it was?
1.0,u2_3d,"Waddaya mean I can't give it 7 stars? Fantastic. If you get the chance, see this."
1.0,u2_3d,"Outstanding, sensory overload."
1.0,u2_3d,amazing!!! next best ting after dere concerts!!!
1.0,u2_3d,AMAZING. Granted I wasn't sober when I saw this.
1.0,u2_3d,yea its like youre in the concert....which was a great concert too boot!!!!
1.0,u2_3d,brillient! actually wanted 2 get up n start dancing!! lol
1.0,u2_3d,This is the closest I'll ever come to seeing U2 live... Check it out if you can!
1.0,u2_3d,"It is pretty rare that I would admit that a film is better than a live show, but this is definitely the exception."
1.0,u2_3d,"Even better than the real thing, this is how you should see a rock concert film. Amazing."
1.0,u2_3d,Saw them play this concert 2 years ago. This was better.
1.0,u2_3d,MUST SEE! I am so serious! I've seen it 3 times and I would see it again!
1.0,u2_3d,"This movie was brilliant! I had to stop myself from jumping out of my seat and singing along with them. It could have done with some backstage footage - I guess I was expecting something along the lines of Rattle and Hum, but the 3D effects were brilliant nonetheless. Highly recommended to all!"
1.0,u2_3d,Astounding experience. Almost better than being there in the live concert.
1.0,u2_3d,Freakin' AWESOME! Make sure you sit down the front to get the full 3D experience.
1.0,u2_3d,"totally amazing , like you were on stage with the boys... dodgey glasses though"
1.0,u2_3d,"Excellent concert! Difficile d'expÃ©rimenter un spectacle de plus prÃ¨s! La magie du 3D rend trÃ¨s bien l'ambiance Ã©lectrisante du show, de la foule et du plaisir des musiciens. Choix musical parfait! Vraiment Ã  ne pas manquer."
1.0,u2_3d,"yep, totally awesome, better than front row seats, there are times you think you're actually at the concert. The 3D effects were fantastic :)"
1.0,u2_3d,ItÂ´s simply spectacular...!
1.0,u2_3d,Go see this at IMAX. GO!
1.0,u2_3d,I've just become a fan of U2 after seeing this 3D concert. It is absolutely brilliant. Don't miss it!
1.0,u2_3d,"What a fantastic experience. The music, the concert venue, the crowd, the 3D effects, U2's challenge for unity. One of the best films I've ever watched. Could watch it over and over - but alas, I would need a 3D auditorium to manage this."
1.0,u2_3d,"If you're a fan of U2, this was well-worth seeing. Almost as good as actually being at a concert (and in some ways better, if you were otherwise stuck in the 'nose-bleeds')."
1.0,u2_3d,"Wow, simply unbelievable."
1.0,u2_3d,Really enjoyed it. Made you feel right there
1.0,u2_3d,"almost better than being at a live concert. the perspectives were fantastic, as were the song choices."
1.0,u2_3d,es como estar en el escenario durante el concierto
1.0,u2_3d,the theatre was rocked.
1.0,u2_3d,Every U2 fan will be hugely disappointed if they miss this film. the camera work is sensational and the sound in the cinema is the next best thing to being there. the 3d effect enhances the movie rather than becoming the gimic of the movie. see it!
1.0,u2_3d,Almost as good as being front row in Adelaide 2006!!! Just a shame no-one else in the cinema was rockin'...
1.0,u2_3d,"This was a religious experience in IMAX. 3D and other visual effects were integrated well and not gimmicky. The perspectives were amazing, from being down in the pit with the audience or looking out on stadium crowd of lighters and cell phones from the stage. WOW."
1.0,u2_3d,I love U2 but I've never been in a concert so this movie was fun! It was if I were there a bit The only thing is: u cannot really get up and dance...
1.0,u2_3d,Conditional five start based upon whether you are a U2 fan or not...if your not...well man up already! The only reason IMAX is every worth going to. So many cool aspects; you feel like you are being flown around the stage on the end of the boom instead of the camera!
1.0,u2_3d,The closest thing you will get to the real thing! Seeing it in IMAX brings all the senses to life that you'd experience at the real gig! Very entertaining and brilliantly shot!
1.0,u2_3d,"this was one of the best experience ever! its unreal .. the 3d, the sound.. its so close!!"
1.0,u2_3d,"Unbelievable, the pictures and especially the sound design are amazing!"
1.0,u2_3d,"You must see this. Run to see this movie, if you like ever wanted to be a musician. Go see this movie, if you like music. The only people who should not go see this movie, is if you are one of those rare people who can't stand Bono's vocals. Go see this movie."
1.0,u2_3d,Beautiful....watch it in IMAX and u'll know what i am talking bout. Must see for every U2 fan.
1.0,u2_3d,As close as you can get without being in the front row.
1.0,u2_3d,"WOW. A must for any U2 fan. Heck, even if you only like a couple of their songs, go see it for the coolness of 3D!"
1.0,u2_3d,"THIS MOVIE WAS AWESOME. That's all you need to know, go see it on an iMax screen if you can, you can thank me later."
1.0,u2_3d,"Just Awesome, the 3D works so well, really puts you there, don't have to be U2 fan."
1.0,u2_3d,"great visuals, awesome in 3D and IMAZ experience. I was disappointed when i saw them last year in concert but this show made up for it."
1.0,u2_3d,This is really awesome!! Especially I watched it in IMAX theatre...
1.0,u2_3d,"It was so close to The Edge playing guitar that I could even learn how to play some songs!! It was great!! And if you go with somebody how feels like you, no price for it..."
1.0,u2_3d,the 3D of this is spectacular
1.0,u2_3d,Great way to use 3D technology! Super concert - awesome music - excellent filming. Really fun experience. See it on IMAX if you can.
1.0,u2_3d,Amazing! A must see for all fans of rock!
1.0,u2_3d,"A absolutely must, itâ??s the closest you get to watching them Live."
1.0,u2_3d,"I have never been this stunned at a visual/sonic experience; the only thing that came close was Blue Man Group's live shows, but they aren't touring out here..."
1.0,u2_3d,U2 rock... This movie rocked... the next best thing to being at a U2 concert in real life! Do your self a favour and get yourself to IMAX now!!!
1.0,u2_3d,"Rock star awesome. Loved it. Very very difficult to remain seated throughout, had a strong compulsion to start jumping up and down and singing loudly!! With or without you was my fave. Go U2!"
1.0,u2_3d,Totally F#@#ing wicked. awesome experience. felt like you were at the concert with bono and the boys 2 feet away from you. When can we go again?
1.0,u2_3d,The most incredible experience I've ever had in a cinema! I was stunned. Possibly the future of cinema??? Looked and sounded amazing!
1.0,u2_3d,Sensational. Brilliant. Incredible. And a little freaky to see a giant Bono inches from your face.
1.0,u2_3d,holy fuck this was amazing!!!
1.0,u2_3d,This was the best! I wanted to get up and dance!
1.0,u2_3d,You say you are a fan of U2 eh? But you haven't seen U2 3D? You ain't no fan of mine...
1.0,u2_3d,"This was incredible. If you have never seen U2 in concert, this is the next best thing."
1.0,u2_3d,Awesome- not many bands (ever) could fit together 5-6 songs that make such a deep statement regarding our modern world -loved it
1.0,u2_3d,Imperdible para fanatico de U2 como yo.... Ponserse anteojitos y disfrutar...
1.0,u2_3d,excellent!! go see it its ure only chance
1.0,u2_3d,awesome technology.... very cool.
1.0,u2_3d,"Awesome, a must for any U2 fan, or any fan of great music and great cinema. Don't Miss"
1.0,u2_3d,Probably the best concert film I've seen. Sorry Trent. You actually feel like you are right there on the stage.
1.0,u2_3d,As close as your ever gonna get to being on stage with Bono. Amazing!! So much detail. If you like U2 you need to see this. Left the Imax thinking i had been to the real thing.
1.0,u2_3d,Bluffant... Vous ne les verriez mÃªme pas comme Ã§a s'ils chantaient rien que pour vous dans votre salon!
1.0,u2_3d,"Unforgettable, who has the opportunity to see it I recomand it. If u're going to the live concert u can't be next to BONO on the stage, HERE IS POSSIBLE. I WAS SHIVERING."
1.0,u2_3d,"mind blowing, feels like you're there."
1.0,u2_3d,"If you like U2, definitely see this"
1.0,u2_3d,AMAZING - anyone who even remotely likes U2 will love this. Same show I saw in Hawaii and it was better than being at the show live. ;)
1.0,u2_3d,"J'avais presque l'impression d'être de retour au coeur du stade de france ! Seul regret, le son : pas assez fort pour que l'immersion soit totale !"
1.0,u2_3d,Almost as good as being at one of their concerts.
1.0,u2_3d,Breathtaking! The closest thing to being there you'll ever get.
1.0,u2_3d,Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,u2_3d,"AMAZING! I just saw it, and it blew me away. It was like going to the concert and flying around it. Don't miss it."
1.0,u2_3d,"This is how 3D music cinema should look like. Just amazing! It is almost like being there, but much more inexpensive like a U2 ticket at all. Rock! I have to go and see it again (and again)l ."
1.0,u2_3d,Perfect rating for sheer innovation. Stunning. If you dont 100% hate Bono and want him to die. You have to enjoy this.
1.0,u2_3d,Amaaaazing! could almost be better than being at the actual concert!!!
1.0,u2_3d,AMAZING movie. Seeing U2 perform in 3D is like you're in the front row of th concert. You feel like you're part of the crowd and rocking with the band.
1.0,u2_3d,AMAZING!!!!! highly recommended!!! stunning!! breathtaking!!!
1.0,u2_3d,"impresionante. Ningun fan de U2 debe dejar de verla. Filmada 90% en el recital de River, en Buenos Aires. Y para todo el que disfrute de la buena musica rock pop en una experiencia increible."
1.0,u2_3d,"If all bands made concert movies like this, I'd never see a live concert again. Wearing the goofy 3-D glasses was way worth the trippy experience, especially when Bono reached out to ""wipe your tears away."""
1.0,u2_3d,APISTEYTI EMPEIRIA!!!!!
1.0,u2_3d,AMAZING even if you dont like U2...Cheers to Kerrang! for the Free night out aswel
1.0,u2_3d,v.v.v. good... I saw this tour live and actually preferred this film. Mainly because you can actually see what is happening. Like you finally get to see Mullens in his crazy human metronome glory
0.0,u2_3d,"Amazing how far you can get with just three guitar chords and an ego with its own gravitational field. Pretentious tuneless rubbish!! Thank you, you've been wonderful, Good night!!"
1.0,u2_3d,MONADIKI EMPEIRIA ! ! ! akomi kai na min sas aresoun katholou oi U2 prepei na deite auti tin tainia opwsdhpote ! ! isws i kaliteri kinimatografiki empeiria EVER!
1.0,u2_3d,"Brilliant. The best 3D of all time, and the sound is incredible. The effects get 6 stars and the setlist gets 3 stars. But I'm feeling charitable. An absolute must-see."
1.0,u2_3d,Amazing concert footage -- feels like you are right smack dab in the crowd
1.0,u2_3d,Must See if you are a U2 Fan!
1.0,u2_3d,"Has convinced me that no matter what the price, I'm goin' to the next concert they play in Canada!!! And I stole the 3D glasses haha."
1.0,u2_3d,"Truly an amazing experince, up close with U2. You can't go wrong. Its like you are really there. WOW"
1.0,u2_3d,I went to the Vertigo show in Houston in '05 and it was AWESOME. This experience was like being on the front row or closer. A definite must-see for every U2 fan.
1.0,u2_3d,How did I manage to remain seated??? Still wondering...
1.0,u2_3d,awesome movie except ending
1.0,u2_3d,This was the coolest thing I've ever seen.
1.0,u2_3d,twas greatnow all i have to is make it to a real concert
1.0,u2_3d,I am a huge U2 fan as it is to begin with. This was honestly the best way to spend 2 hours and $14 on a Saturday night. The 3D graphics were phenomenal and nothing beats a 40 foot tall Bono. I HIGHLY recommend to U2 fans and strongly recommend just to see something in the IMAX theater.
1.0,u2_3d,not your mother's 3D! simply amazing - the next best thing to being there!
1.0,u2_3d,"I have to say this is just amazing. Then again, I might be a little biased, but one can't dispute the fact that U2 gave one of the best concerts in the past decade. The 3D element cements this film's greatness."
1.0,u2_3d,An awesome experience
1.0,u2_3d,"This was way better than I expected. It's a given that U2 would be amazing, but the 3D blew me away. 3D has come a long way since the red and blue glasses."
1.0,u2_3d,"This was fantastic, I'm not a huge U2 fan but they played loads of hits with only one or two album tracks that I don't know. This is definitely worth seeing and I hope there will be lots of concert films like it in future."
1.0,u2_3d,Almost like being there in person -- only the views are much better. There were times I didn't know where the theater audience ended and where the movie one began. Very cool. Gonna have to get an IMAX installed in my living room...
1.0,u2_3d,"An amazing experience. Definitely worth every penny and unlike anything else I've ever seen. If you get the chance, please head to an Imax theater and check it out."
1.0,u2_3d,This was fantastic! It was like being there again. I kept trying to reach out. My only problem was with the crowd. No one but us were fired up for it. All I wanted to was break out and dance.
1.0,u2_3d,seen in cinema 1st aww 2nd week of release im not the greatest fan but i like alot of there music great 3d visual a feast for music lovers
1.0,u2_3d,Definitely the best 3-D film I've ever seen...
1.0,u2_3d,ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!!!! A MUST SEE! THOSE OF U IN JHB - ITS ON AT THE ZONE UNTIL 28TH MARCH!
1.0,u2_3d,Amazing cinematography. The digital image is so clear!
1.0,u2_3d,Amazing at the Imax.
1.0,u2_3d,Unbelievably good. Saw it at BFI IMAX. Was just like being at one of their gigs but with the best seats in the house. A must-see.
1.0,u2_3d,"Only one negative point: too short! I love it! I saw at the IMAX cinema in London and I really was tempted to shout and clap after the songs :D!!!!Highly recommended if u love U2 or pop music in general, to see the potential of the 3D applied to everyday experieces like a concert."
1.0,u2_3d,Bono in 3D...need I say more?
1.0,u2_3d,Next best thing to seeing them in concert.
1.0,u2_3d,AWESOME!!! If you love U2 you have got to see this movie. The special 3D effects are breathtaking and it's the way that all concert films should be made!
1.0,u2_3d,Well worth the drive!
1.0,u2_3d,AWESOME! It doesn't even matter if you enjoy U2 or not... Although WHO DOESN'T?!?!?
1.0,u2_3d,!!!! -- no words to describe how awesome it was.My only complaint was that it was too short; I wanted more.
1.0,u2_3d,"This movie is incredible, its like being on stage."
1.0,u2_3d,"Incredibe, awesome, better than live concert"
1.0,u2_3d,"Awesome, amazing, wow, 6 stories of IMaxy 3-D kickassness. And did I mention 3D glasses make you look badass?"
1.0,u2_3d,"i felt like bono was singing to me :) my husband had to remind me that ""um hm he was sitting next to me"" ;)"
1.0,u2_3d,If you are a U2 fan...you will love this.
1.0,u2_3d,This is definitely the best concert I've never been to.
0.0,u2_3d,"Cobblers. If I never hear bloody Sunday Bloody Sunday again it'll be to soon. Hopefully, the U2-BSE documentary will be made next."
1.0,u2_3d,GREAT!! It's almost like being there. Great for people who haven't experienced the band in concert. Loved it!
1.0,u2_3d,Excellent effects and sound
1.0,u2_3d,As close to being at the real thing... with a much better view
1.0,u2_3d,Sick Sick Sick. He uses the microphone stand to mimic the lever of a bomb detonator. Wow. This movie rocked
1.0,u2_3d,"Easily the best concert movie I've ever seen. The 3d totally works, and immerses you like nothing else."
1.0,u2_3d,It's as if ur on the stage with them! Best 15 euro I ever spent
1.0,u2_3d,Even better than the real thing
1.0,u2_3d,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!! They should record all major concerts like this! it is a great way to re-live the experience!
1.0,u2_3d,Well doye. Greatest movie ever. And I don't just mean that because I helped make it.
1.0,u2_3d,Amazing concert film! Beautifully shot in 3D. It packed the emotional punch of having been there live.
1.0,u2_3d,"This movie was freaking AWESOME!!!!! Part movie, big part concert, part music video. Ridiculous sound experience, fantastic footage-you could see the sweat on Bono's eyelids and The Extrme is... there are no words. You MUST see this before it leaves theaters."
1.0,u2_3d,A fantastic concert film. I've seen it twice and would see it again.
1.0,u2_3d,"I saw this movie for he 5th and final time tonight. It is truly an incredible, moving experience, and I'm heartbroken that I won't see the boys again until they tour to support their new album- hopefully coming out in the fall..."
1.0,u2_3d,Love it!!!!! I could watch it over a 100 times and not get tired of it
1.0,u2_3d,"If you can find it in your town, you owe it to yourself. The right band, the right medium. Only minor quibble is the 3D Glasses are not big enough (they should be large like clown glasses to cover the whole field of vision). But in its IMAX impact, maybe the best concert film ever."
1.0,u2_3d,"LOVED IT, LOVED IT, LOVED IT!!!"
1.0,u2_3d,"Awesome experience. The cinematography was great, the sound was fantastic, and it's U2! My only complaint was that the audience was eerily quiet."
1.0,u2_3d,See it at the IMAX and it feels like you're almost there. In fact you get better view than if you were live! Fab sound and great 3D. Great concert too. At cinema would be good but not in same league. IMAX is size of 10 cinema screens.
1.0,u2_3d,"LOVED IT!!! If you are a U2 fan, GO!!"
1.0,u2_3d,I was smiling the whole time! It was such an experience. I felt like I was on stage with them!
1.0,u2_3d,If you like U2 (or have never seen them) this is like having front row seats to their best concert!
1.0,u2_3d,freakin awesome.. it was like being at a concert :)
1.0,u2_3d,"je ne suis pas très objective car j'adoooooooore U2, c'est excellent!!!"
1.0,u2_3d,UNOS! DOS! TRES!! Bloody loved it!! the whole 3D thing made you really feel part of the crowd then part of the band!! Loved the camera work and the editing. Where the Streets Have no Name was blinding!!!!! Every concert be filmed in this way!! Felt as though I'd really just been to a concert!!!!
1.0,u2_3d,"Beautiful, stunning, rocked me to the core. I have never seen U2 live, but I imagine this could only be the next best thing.The 3D was SO crisp, and SO well done. Not gimmicky at all. I wish all films could be made this way."
1.0,u2_3d,FLAWLESS!! BRILLIANT!! JAW-DROPPING!!
1.0,u2_3d,I'm not a fan of U2 but the 3D thing was enough to drag me into the theater to watch this AWESOME concert movie ! The 3D is here to put YOU at the concert and it works . The sound is awesome too . Well ... go watch it coz you won't regret it !!!
1.0,u2_3d,Simply phenomenal!!! It's like you're actually at one of their concerts. Highly recommended...even if you're not that big of a U2 fan.
1.0,u2_3d,Excellent movie...almost as good as seeing U2 live.
1.0,u2_3d,"So totally freakin awesome! MUST SEE if you like U2 at all...even just a little! So inspiring, gave me chills, made me feel like I was there, even better than there--closer than I would have been in real life."
1.0,u2_3d,This was freaken awesome!! i love U2 and this was the best show i've ever seen!! go see it!!
1.0,u2_3d,"Want to see a U2 concert without the insanity of actually going to a venue? Want to see what perfect 3D looks like? Probably the best concert video ever made, a MUST SEE by technophiles, U2 lovers, and concert-goers everywhere."
1.0,u2_3d,"Absolutely incredible! Like having the best concert tickets ever, only better!"
1.0,u2_3d,Amazingly done. Great concert film of a band at the height of its power
1.0,u2_3d,my hubby is the U2 fan and he was ecstatic by the end!!! the effects were amazing!!!
1.0,u2_3d,I saw this with my 14 year old son. He went reluctantly with his old man and came home an enthusiastic U2 fan. This is a great concert film. The 3D is pretty cool too.
1.0,u2_3d,Whaow! But frustrating because nobody really moved during the film...
1.0,u2_3d,the best i've ever seen
1.0,u2_3d,"LOVED IT! awesome, it was almost as being there. and in some ways better. having the vantage point of being on the stage was very cool. I wish more concerts were recorded in 3D."
1.0,u2_3d,"I adore U2, and it brought me back to the concert! It was awkward to sit in the theater and not be dancing though. The actual concert was amazing."
1.0,u2_3d,Great 3D Film Great Band Great Music Great 3D FX
1.0,u2_3d,Saw it and...... Of course loved it!
1.0,u2_3d,Loved this movie - saved the glasses for when it comes out on DVD! Wish they would have cranked the sound - my only complaint. Amazing technology.
1.0,u2_3d,Just like being at the gig only much beter. See it now!! :)
1.0,u2_3d,"You almost feel like you are watching this live. Amazing concert movie, had an awesome time watching my favorite band."
1.0,u2_3d,No 15 minute Rant about the One-Campaign? Whats a u2 show without one of those? It was great though. the 3D was pretty sweet.
1.0,u2_3d,"A great concert film, even for those who aren't the biggest fans of U2. I happen to be a big fan, and had a rockin' good time. Not as good as an actual concert, of course, but that's a completely different kind of experience anyway. Worth the time, worth the money."
1.0,u2_3d,"This would have been a pretty great concert film even without the 3D feature. Definitely the next best thing to being at the show, and probably a superior experience in many ways. I can't see how anyone could not be a fan of this band after watching this."
1.0,u2_3d,love it. it is the best movie.. I so love U2
1.0,u2_3d,"This was an amazing concert film. If you like U2 even just a little bit, you should definitely see this film!"
1.0,u2_3d,"A must-see, totally amazing - almost as good as being there and almost as good as being on the front row but better as i didnt have to queue for 9 hours! you'll regret it if you dont see it..."
1.0,u2_3d,"C'est fou, Bono vient vous essuyer la joue sur ""sunday bloody sunday"" et on est dans le public pour revivre encore une fois ce spectacle fantastique..."
1.0,u2_3d,Best movie experience ever
1.0,u2_3d,u should go see it if its still on...pretty amazing...i didnt even like the songs before i went to the concert...but after that i will always be U2 fan
1.0,u2_3d,"Awesome. Simply awesome. Great music, and the 3D was great. Unlike a lot of 3D, it didn't seem fake; it was very natural."
1.0,u2_3d,AMAZING! Just like going to a U2 concert except far less expensive and exausting AND made me miss my friends.
1.0,u2_3d,"great film, good concert and good set list"
1.0,u2_3d,Awesome movie. Everyone should see this movie!
1.0,u2_3d,This was simply unbelievable! I will be going a 2nd time.
1.0,u2_3d,Just got back from seeing U2 3D and it was AMAZING!!! I'm not even a U2 fan but I am now!! Great music...the 3D aspect was awesome...you could almost reach out and wipe the sweat off of Bono...I HIGHLY reccomend it
1.0,u2_3d,The Best experience!!!!
1.0,u2_3d,dont ya just love bono!!!!!!!
1.0,u2_3d,U2 in your living room. Amazing.
1.0,u2_3d,"Awesome, amazing, unbelievable, really wanted to jump up and down and yell....not good in tiered seating...go and see it! BFI IMAX on the South Bank."
1.0,u2_3d,Awesome! I would go see it again and again!
1.0,u2_3d,Amazing! Even if you aren't a long-time U2 fan...see this movie! See it in IMAX and get blown away!
1.0,u2_3d,"awesome, just like you are right there"
1.0,u2_3d,"Such an incredible shot of adrenaline. Almost as good as actually being at the concert. Sometimes better. You are so close to Bono, the Edge, Adam, and Larry, that it feels like you can touch them."
0.0,u2_3d,"u2 are the wussiest, least talented, most over-hyped cumstain on the planet. They have sucked the life out of rock. Pompous, self-aggrandizing cocksuckers."
1.0,u2_3d,"I felt like I was there! Fantastic, if you're a U2 fan you MUST see this film."
1.0,u2_3d,"Way freaking awesome. U2 is amazing, 3D is amazing, how could they not be amazing when combined? Just a really cool movie that everyone should see."
1.0,u2_3d,Absolutely awesome. : ) But how could I think otherwise.
1.0,u2_3d,"you gotta see it, even if you aren't a u2 fan. it's not like the old crappy 3d, it's a new digital 3d technology that is just incredible, hard to describe. simply amazing!"
1.0,u2_3d,"The best 3D ""movie"" I've seen. This was great! The only downside is not being able to stand up and cheer!"
1.0,u2_3d,"awesome!!! i dont recall a more amazing movie experience, now there is this thing though, i wanted to jump and sing along and everyone was quiet so its kind of a weird feeling"
1.0,u2_3d,My only criticism of this movie was that it was too short. I could easily have sat through another hour. And it should absolutely be seen at the theater.
1.0,u2_3d,Outstanding! So good I went to see it again the next night.
1.0,u2_3d,Take my hat off to the greatest and most innovative band.
1.0,u2_3d,"Amazing, freakin incredible. Best concert film ever."
1.0,u2_3d,brilliant and amazing. was a beautiful day...
1.0,u2_3d,Excellent! Must see!
1.0,u2_3d,pretty fantastic. usually 3D movies end up annoying me but this used it perfectly and with great effect. an experience.
1.0,u2_3d,"So cool. Why spend over $100 for a ticket in a shitty, far away seat when you can spend $15 to see U2 in 3D, up close and personal. This film truly is made for the devoted U2 fan. Go see it if you are! It's worth it."
1.0,u2_3d,Better than seeing them live! It is as though you are right there. Seeing the swaying crowd was really cool
1.0,u2_3d,"Doesn't quite match the real live experience I had seeing them, but its the best 3D experience nonetheless."
1.0,u2_3d,Bono's voice is the one I want to hear when I die. I loved this movie and I missed my boys dearly. They need to tour soon!
1.0,u2_3d,It felt like being there. Amazing!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,u2_3d,Really difficult not to join in with the crowd - like being on stage with Bono and Edge
1.0,u2_3d,"Absolutely awesome, even if you are not into u-2 ya gotta enjoy this before its gone"
1.0,u2_3d,"Band were amazing, 3D is the future...even better than the real thing!"
1.0,u2_3d,"I've been center stage, front row for a U2 concert before and in certain ways this was even better. What an amazing experience! I absolutely loved it. U2 is the greatest rock band in the history of the world."
1.0,u2_3d,Amazing. I was mesmerized throughout the entire concert....I already want to see it again!!! :o)
1.0,u2_3d,"I was blown away by the 3D and U2, must see if you are a U2 fan, you'd be impressed if you are not."
1.0,u2_3d,AWESOME! The transition into Sundy Bloody Sunday was killer! Bono nailed Pavarotti's part in Miss Sarajevo. Would love to see it agin!
1.0,u2_3d,Awesome movie! Great effects! U2 at their best. Am planning to go again! MUST SEE IF YOUR A U2 FAN. It was as if I was on stage with the band.
1.0,u2_3d,"It was like a front-row seat for $14.75. BRILLIANT! I could hardly keep my seat for ""Pride/In the Name of Love"" and ""Where the Streets Have No Name."""
1.0,u2_3d,"It was absofreakinlutely amazing! I really can't say enough about how great it was. Highly, highly recommended."
1.0,u2_3d,Absolutely spellbinding - see it!
1.0,u2_3d,I loved this movie. Great tour and a fun Movie. I may have to see it again
1.0,u2_3d,"All concerts should now be like this. It was so awesome!! I wanted to get up so bad, and dance!!"
1.0,u2_3d,"A spectacular and exhilarating extravaganza for the eyes and ears. Hey, that sounded pretty good. I have seen U2 live and this is almost as good. I wish they'd sung a few more hits but otherwise it was amazing. Hopefully this sets and trend and we will see more artists with films like this."
1.0,u2_3d,"pure exhilaration! its like going to a concert w/o the bouncing tiggers to block you, a sweat-free, larger than life-$15 dollar tickets...."
1.0,u2_3d,"Very well made. Good choice of songs. The lights, camera work, angles, and effects were really well made. Very political, but that's just U2 and that's what makes them so powerful."
1.0,u2_3d,"This was shockingly good. Go out of your way to see this, if you can."
1.0,u2_3d,I want more movies like this1 They just need to turn up the volume so I can sing along...
1.0,u2_3d,Amazing! All films should be in 3D!
1.0,u2_3d,"Good set list, maybe a bit biased towards HTDAAB, but I guess that is to be expected. It's beautifully filmed, very clear, crisp, with lots of detail."
1.0,u2_3d,"Fantastic! A few songs short of the actual set-list, but 90 minutes of mind-blowing rock delivered in a state-of-the-art 3D that is never gimmicky but just makes you feel as though you are THERE!! Highly recommended to see at an IMAX too!"
1.0,u2_3d,Awesome movie! Even my little one enjoyed it! And yes! it's a must see for every U2 fan
1.0,u2_3d,"saw this, go and see it. the effect is fantastic, i shook hands with bono in buenos aires! the 3d is so far removed from anything i have ever seen b-4, and the music/sound quality is stunning."
1.0,u2_3d,omg this best thing ive ever seen
1.0,u2_3d,"It rocked, wanted to get up and start dancing."
1.0,u2_3d,"It's better than the concert!! Great expirience! It's a great film, and obiously a magnificent Band!!"
1.0,u2_3d,"Fantastic experience. ALMOST as good as seeing them live. If you are a U2 fan, or hell, just never been to concert of their magnitude, then by all means you must check this out."
1.0,u2_3d,Without a doubt the coolest thing I've ever seen OR heard in a movie theatre
1.0,u2_3d,Does exactly what it says on the Tin. U2 in 3D. It is a must for any U2 fan and the quality of the 3D is excellent. You do actually feel you are in the ground jumping up and down.
1.0,u2_3d,"Awesome in digital 3D and great sound. I could feel the music, loud and clear. Great concert film."
1.0,u2_3d,"If you are a U2 fan, then this is a definate must see. Its well worth it. The song Miss Sarajevo brought a tear to my eye with Bono doing opera from the late great Pavoratti.  With 3D, you really get a feel of actually being at a U2 show."
1.0,u2_3d,Fucking awesome. Have seen them in concert. Like being there for a fraction of the price.
1.0,u2_3d,The first must see flim of the year. do yourself a favor and see this.
1.0,u2_3d,So Good the camera work was out of this world. if i was allowed on stage and to run around i still won't have as good a view
1.0,u2_3d,It was amazing!! It's in Peoria this week.
1.0,u2_3d,"My first IMAX movie, and it was U2."
1.0,u2_3d,"Go see it before its too late. Great performance, groundbreaking 3D."
1.0,u2_3d,"Awesome! I just wished I would had been able to get up of my seat and dance like in a real concert. Unfortunately, Have not gone to one of their concerts yet, but this was so awesome, I can't complaint! :)"
1.0,u2_3d,Saw it in an IMAX... It was really like Being There!
1.0,u2_3d,"A truly amazing experience. No backstage, just front and center wall-to-wall music and visuals. See it. Feel it. Enjoy it. Hope to see a U23D2 in the near future with more songs."
1.0,u2_3d,"This movie was great! The 3D idea was a great one, it adds a whole nother level to the performance. I have watched other performances and always love them, but this made everything so much better."
1.0,u2_3d,"Amazed at the talent, technology, artistry.....enjoyed every minute of the experience.....thanks to my son!"
1.0,u2_3d,A MUST!!! this new 3D Technology is amazing!
1.0,u2_3d,"U2 kicks ass and this is one of the best, if not THE best concert film I have ever seen."
1.0,u2_3d,"Fantastic, just an amazing visual."
1.0,u2_3d,Awesome movie - the 3-D technology is way beyond anything you've ever seen. And the concert was great. See it at an IMAX if you can.
1.0,u2_3d,"Even non-fans will appreciate the showmanship of this band, and the use of 3D in a non-gimmicky format."
1.0,u2_3d,I converted two so-so U2 fans to true believers because of this movie...
0.0,u2_3d,"evidemment 1h20 de U2 avec de gros plans sur bono qui tend les mains vers la caméras pour accentuer l'effet 3d, ça fatigue..."
1.0,u2_3d,"F'N BRILLIANT. If Bono and crew ran a church, even SCIENTOLOGY...I would be there. If you have an IMAX/3D theater near you, and it's playing...GET OFF THE COMPUTER AND GO AND FREE YOUR MIND and SURELY your ass will follow.But, 'I don't mean to BUG YA!'"
1.0,u2_3d,"Absolutely belting to see U2 on Imax. The 3d was good but benefited most from the Imax DMR format, and Imax sound. Recommended, essential if you are into U2 (and they didn't even play many of their bast tracks)"
1.0,u2_3d,It was really good...Bono and The Edge were awesome..and so was Adam and Larry..they had great 3D effects and they played my favorite songs from them!!!!
1.0,u2_3d,This is a must see!! Feels like you are part of the audience - Amazing!! and the volume!! this is something special - think i'll see it again before it finishes....
1.0,u2_3d,"Amazing! Go and see it NOW! Feels like you are at the gig, it's quite a bizarre feeling. Saw this at an Imax cinema which was just fantastic with the combined effects of the massive screen and volume. I want to see it again already!"
1.0,u2_3d,"Awesome live show in 3D. Not only did you feel that you're actually at a U2 concert, but at times you felt you were also on stage with the group. This is the best concert that I never went to. Could have done with turning the volume right up."
1.0,u2_3d,"Abselutely amazing! This movie will blow your MIND. The experiance is as if you're really there. Once you've seen it, you'll never think of U2 the same as you once did."
1.0,u2_3d,Absolutely brilliant! You really do feel as if you are in the crowd.
1.0,u2_3d,"An amazing experience. I saw this in Imax 3D, and it just felt so real. Surely its better than the actual concert, where you'd be stuffed at the back and can hardly see anything? Here, right up on the stage, it was brilliant. Perhaps they could have played a better setlist, but that's nothing major."
1.0,u2_3d,I wouldn't mind watching all movies/concerts this way!
1.0,u2_3d,Front row seat to an UNBELIEVABLE U2 concert. This is a must see!
1.0,u2_3d,"i am s huge u2 fan and i have to say this was the best u2 movie i have seen, the 3d makes it feel like u are there at the concert if you are a fan you HAVE to go see it"
1.0,u2_3d,This is the best new concert movie to come along in years. The perfect blending of visuals and music. SEE IT IN IMAX
1.0,u2_3d,"just saw it, AWESOME. i'd work 3 years straight just to have enough money to go see U2."
1.0,u2_3d,"OK, So I'm biased. But this is a stunning spectacle on every level that you really ought to see even if you only have a passing interest in U2 or cinema. Superb."
1.0,u2_3d,Absolutely phenomenal film.
1.0,u2_3d,"An absolutely amazing experience...you just completely lose touch with your physical surroundings. Probably has the full effect only for someone who really appreciates how amazing U2 are, but even if you dont it would probably still be a great experience."
1.0,u2_3d,"My buddy Steve and i saw this film last week. AWESOME!! I wanna marry the edge,bono,Larry....and Adam. So amazing..so cool...such a great experience.Check it...Now!!!"
1.0,u2_3d,"Fantastic experience! I'm a huge fan and have seen them a few times in concert. But this film was amazing because you really see the band, and feel like you are there. It is even better than the real thing. Fantastic!"
1.0,u2_3d,Awesome visual and audio experience that perfectly captures the experience that is a live U2 show.
1.0,u2_3d,this is a real experience. mind-blowing effects on 3d.
1.0,u2_3d,If you love U2 - WATCH it! it feels like ur there! All the songs are Classics!
1.0,u2_3d,Amazing concert. Wish it had gone on for longer...
1.0,u2_3d,Absolutely amazing!!!!!!!!!
1.0,u2_3d,"This blew me away. Almost as good as being there live! You have to see this in IMAX, only way. So amazing!"
1.0,u2_3d,"this was a visceral experience visual as well as being emmersed in the party that is a U2 concert. the music was great, the messages were great, this was almost better than actually seeing Bono and the band live."
1.0,u2_3d,Fantastic!! I loved it.
1.0,u2_3d,"It was as good, if not better, then seeing them live. Amazing, I have a whole new apperciation of U2!"
1.0,u2_3d,wonderful movie...felt like i was there at the show.
1.0,u2_3d,Loved it! Leave it to U2 to do something like this. Need to see it again - kind of like needing to see U2 in concert again!
1.0,u2_3d,Sexy like a sports car.
1.0,u2_3d,Awesome!!! Makes you wish you had your own Theater to see over and over again!!
1.0,u2_3d,an eye-popping spectatular that makes you feel like you are realy there. U2 realy made a great decision with this one!
1.0,u2_3d,"Best concert movie I've ever seen. In fact, I saw this movie three times on the IMAX in Dallas."
1.0,u2_3d,Even better than the real thing.
1.0,u2_3d,I want to see it again.
1.0,u2_3d,WOW...that's all I can say
1.0,u2_3d,"I am so not the person to ask for an objective take on this, but I have seen them live. And nothing could compare to that, but if something could, this is it."
1.0,u2_3d,This was a very good performance from U2.The song One was done well!
1.0,new_york_doll,If you buy this get it from Deseret Book. Great DVD.
1.0,new_york_doll,"Phineas & Ferb fan? This is likely whom they referenced in the ""Ain't Got Rhythm"" segment - a retired musician now working in a library, possibly rejoining his mates to form a Police-type band. Arthur's story is a happy, and sad, one. This is a fantastic movie."
1.0,new_york_doll,One of the most moving documentaries ever filmed.
1.0,new_york_doll,Fascinating documentary about somebody I knew nothing about.
1.0,new_york_doll,A TRULY TOUCHING FILM.
1.0,new_york_doll,Fantastic! I love this movie. It will bring on the sads though so be prepared.
1.0,new_york_doll,Even if your not a Doll's fan this movie is worth watching.
1.0,new_york_doll,"This was an unexpected treat! Not your run-of-the mill ""behind the music"" sorta movie."
1.0,new_york_doll,Great bitter sweet story. Strange enough I used to date the Directors wife.
1.0,new_york_doll,"probably one of the best music documentaries ever. it's sweet and sad and rock'n'roll. it's like morrissey becoming amelie poulain and making this former glory's dream come true. i actually got goosebumps when they jumped up onstage in london. if you like real music, you can't miss this."
1.0,new_york_doll,touching documentary. a must-see!

The greatest classic of all musicals."
1.0,singin_in_the_rain,"This IS the best movie-musical of all time. Yes, better than West Side Story. It lives and breathes on wit, humor, and breathtaking dance numbers in place of a slew of catchy songs. My favorite sequence is ""Moses Supposes"" with Gene Kelly and Donald."

1.0,singin_in_the_rain,"One of those films whose groundbreaking achievemnts lie in the fact that it was never intended to be a groundbreaking achievement. The quintessential Hollywood musical, it has never been matched. Should filmakers seek to ressurect the genre, it would be extremely wise to use this film as a template."

1.0,singin_in_the_rain,One of the best musicals ever. It dumps the musical formula on its head by having largely irrelevant and irreverent musical numbers.

1.0,exit_through_the_gift_shop,"First part was fascinating, second part endearing. All in all, Banksy, Theirry, and the filmmakers have created beautiful art."
0.0,exit_through_the_gift_shop,Joke of a movie starts out with promise then you realize you were simply being trolled by whom ever actually created the film. They basically tell you how dumb the public is when it comes to art.

1.0,exit_through_the_gift_shop,We've all been myster brain washed.

1.0,exit_through_the_gift_shop,"One of the best mockumentary films I've seen. It combines humor, wit, and an adept cast to tell the story of street artists."
1.0,exit_through_the_gift_shop,"Embodying all the edge and mystery of street art, Exit Through the Gift Shop is an acerbic and subversive commentary on the nature of inspiration, originality, and the reflexive nature between object and subject."

1.0,exit_through_the_gift_shop,"This has to be my favorite movie of 2010. Far out and ridiculously hilarious, this documentary captures a part of this world we have never seen before. We are living in a new wave revolution of art and did not even know! Or is this new wave just a hoax?"
1.0,exit_through_the_gift_shop,"This movie is FANTASTIC. A truly amazing look at street art from one of the masters. He's cocky, he's critical, but Banksy is a true artistic genius. His apprentice Thierry Guetta on the other hand is an absolute riot. Really funny, clever and heartfelt."

1.0,exit_through_the_gift_shop,*really* interesting!
0.0,exit_through_the_gift_shop,This must've been an elaborate wind up several years in the making. Banksy's 15 minutes has come and gone and the whole Thierry Guetta story just seemed a weak attempt at preserving that 15 mins and laying praise on an already over-praised media sensation.

1.0,exit_through_the_gift_shop,"Hoax or not (and I tend to think not), the film's central thesis holds: that the art world's commodification of ""street"" authenticity is as hollow as the (real or contrived) career of Mister Brainwash. A gripping, often hilarious saga featuring an assortment of obsessives and thrill-seekers."
1.0,exit_through_the_gift_shop,"Brilliant documentary. Banksy taking a piss out of art world by introducing mr brainwashed, who as some people say, may be a just a work of art."

1.0,exit_through_the_gift_shop,"What is art? Banksy makes the question far more confusing than ever, and the proposed answer is seriously funny and seriously tragic. The footage is a joy to watch, the narration is a joy to listen to, and the film is incredibly entertaining. It all comes together in a beautifully unwrapped package."
1.0,exit_through_the_gift_shop,"Little masterpiece documentary. Very fun to watch. Mocks on the ways of art and its trending frenzies that do not question substance or ultimately concept authenticity. In economic terms: art lacks arbitrage fundamentals to make it ""reasonably"" valued to any extent. Behold MBW..."

1.0,nashville,"This still sits as my absolute favorite Robert Altman films. It's epic and one of the top movies of the 1970's. Some people may find it dull or daunting, but if you enjoy sprawling lifelike epics. This movie is near perfection."
1.0,nashville,"""Nashville"" is genius. Even though it is set in the '70s, the themes our obsession with celebrity and power is even more relevant today (NSA and tabloid-lovers please note)."
1.0,nashville,"Starting off as a bizarre circus, tearing itself off bit by bit, and finally culminating in, perhaps, the most heartbreaking final contour ever."
1.0,nashville,"One of the great mosaics of Altman's career, a pastiche of zeitgeist Americana that does justice to a great concept - the parable of jingoistic country music as politics. Hollow aspirations become grandiose plans, powerful men in suits pull strings and honest souls are casualties."
0.0,nashville,This might be the worst movie I've ever seen. Terrible
1.0,nashville,"Standby...We are working on a date...I would like to kick off the Summer ""Under the Stars"" with what I consider one of the finest films ever..."
0.0,nashville,"I don't know how this rated so high. If this is the high point of Altman's films, I will be sure to avoid any others. Long, meandering, strangely veiled political claptrap with no discernible plot, and less than third rate music."
1.0,nashville,"É impressionante como Altman desenvolve todos os inúmeros personagens do filme, ao mesmo tempo que faz um interessante retrato dos EUA daquela época."
1.0,nashville,"My all-time favorite film (tied with ""La Dolce Vita""). Brilliantly scathing and mesmerizing from first minute to last! Utterly devastating! One of the great soundtracks in film history, without doubt! A must-see for anyone who cares about mature and intelligent cinema!!!"
0.0,nashville,"What do others see in this movie? Very slow, not much music, music isn't great."
1.0,nashville,"So many characters, so many stories, so well done."
1.0,nashville,Fantastic ensemble piece.
1.0,nashville,"A film that is way ahead of it's time. Brilliant acting all around from everyone, a great soundtrack, and a story that is a bit complex but well-told. Robert Altman truly delivers in this film."
1.0,nashville,I have to watch this again.

1.0,nashville,One of the best American films about America ever made.
1.0,nashville,"An immensely broad tapestry of American culture, particularly country music and politics. Such real characters. A masterpiece of comedy, drama, and all our feelings that can come spilling out when you least expect."
0.0,nashville,"# 59 on AFI's Top 100 Movie's List - I guess I like movies that sensationalize life rather than just observe it. I found the movie boring and predictable, complicated by the fact that 2 hours and 40 minutes of country music is not a pleasant experience for me."
1.0,nashville,"This is my absolute favorite American film. If you want to experience life in 1975, watch this film."
1.0,nashville,"Nashville is one of the most devastatingly profound movies I've ever seen, but I can't really explain why. Just one of those things."
1.0,nashville,Does for country music what M*A*S*H did for war doctors. It's long and at times rambling but it's always brilliant.

1.0,nashville,Robert Altman is a genius
1.0,nashville,predicted modern country by about thirty years.
1.0,nashville,Like a living and breathing political cartoon. One of a kind.
1.0,nashville,"Robert Altman's film is ingenius in it's aimlessness, powerful in it's simplicity; Nashville remains a personal favorite because of it's sweet naivety."
1.0,nashville,"An incredible film. I'm not sure why, but it left me devastated."
1.0,nashville,there is much to see in this ensemble extravaganza. characters and stories galore.
1.0,nashville,"I've only seen it once. But that one time made a strong impression. Until I see it again, I'll let this rating stand."
1.0,nashville,History was written by a film Director
0.0,nashville,"this movie absolutely sucked. no, seriously. just horrible!"
0.0,nashville,My own personal hell
1.0,nashville,One of the greatest films in American cinema.
1.0,nashville,"The absolute best film of the 70's. Altman understands people, and he loves his characters, and while the pace never slows, it is still easy to be knocked over by what happens in this film. This film practically defines humanity. This is life, and altman is a genius."
0.0,nashville,"The fact that there are too many characters makes it very loose in structure and confusing. Slow, boring and tediously long. What the hell is going on actually? Only a few seemingly implicit scenes and songs are worth a little praise. I want my 160 minutes back!"
1.0,nashville,"The opening song ""200 Years"" is epic.  ""We must be doing something right to last 200 years!"""
1.0,nashville,Best Altman. One of the best movies ever made.
1.0,nashville,"When did subtlety die off in comedies? This movie is hilarious, but its hard to tell if you're not paying attention. One of my top ten comedies for sure. I wonder what Altman thought about Ace Ventura."
1.0,nashville,"there will never be another director like altman. plenty of people are trying, sure, but he was in a class of his own."
1.0,nashville,I saw this movie for the third time last night. I still love it and I'm not fond of country music. One of the great Atlman movies The performers all wrote their own songs and much of the dialog was unscripted. A great movie.
1.0,nashville,Greatest movie ever made about what it means to be an American. Greatest movie ever made about the idea of America. One of the truly great epics ever produced.
1.0,nashville,Great ensemble acting and fascinating character study.
0.0,nashville,"It was rooms full of people all talking at once for 2 1/2 hours. It may be especially profound, but it completely failed to keep my interest."
0.0,nashville,This film was slow. And wandering. And anti-climactic. And it was bleeding jingoism. Lame.
1.0,nashville,One of Altman's better films - I love Karen Black's snarky rival and Ronee Blakely can really belt 'em out.  What happened to you Ronee?
1.0,nashville,My all-time favorite movie. It's the film that taught me that film can be art as well as entertainment and opened my mind to the wide array of films out there.
1.0,nashville,Not even a scratched up DVD copy could detract from this epic.
1.0,nashville,Robert Altman's unsung masterpiece.
1.0,nashville,I'm Opal from the BBC!
1.0,nashville,"fluye. es un mosaico extraordinario, con un ritmo incomparable. El final siempre me conmueve. El manejo del ritmo, de la narrativa es como pocas peliculas que he visto. De mis favoritas, sin duda"
1.0,nashville,okay. this was amazing. seriously one of the greatest movies i've ever seen. wooow. paul thomas anderson owes SO MUCH to robert altman.. the whooole style of boogie nights is exactly like this. everyone must see this movie. it was just amazing.
1.0,nashville,This is the epitome of a film constructed around theme and feel.
1.0,nashville,"A Masterpiece. One of the most important American Movies ever made, and definately the most influential of the 1970's, no matter what anyone wants to say about The Godfather or The French Connection"
0.0,nashville,Cynical turd of a film.
1.0,nashville,"""I'm easy"" too, Carradine! Hahaha..."
1.0,nashville,One of Altman's best. A sad commentary on fame that doesn't lose its way amongst the myriad of characters.
1.0,nashville,"so fucking great. Love it for the characters and behaviors. I still don't very much dig most country music, but it structures the film perfectly."
1.0,nashville,Great look at the origins of country music and American life in the 1970's. With the final two musical numbers being the film's heartbreaking and inspirational ending.
1.0,nashville,"Obra maestra de Robert Altman que como dice la frase de cajon: ""funciona a muchos niveles"" y que impresiona por su complejidad y humor punzante."
1.0,nashville,Altman's masterpiece. As a director he changed the face of cinema. Geraldine Chaplin outstanding in a first-rate ensemble. A sumptuous feast of a film!
1.0,nashville,The movie that made me fall in love with movies.
1.0,nashville,"I'm surprised I'd never seen this film before, a real masterpiece."
1.0,nashville,so many great characters together!
1.0,nashville,"A great movie, even if you don't like country music (and I mostly don't.) I've seen it twice now and I still don't think I've picked up on everything that's going on."
1.0,nashville,this movie is abosultely one of my favorite movies ever made. the diolouge is still relevent... even over 30 years later
1.0,nashville,Freewheeling observation of bi-centennial era America and its people. Fantastically well done.
1.0,nashville,The I'm Easy scene hits me kind of like a lightning bolt..
1.0,nashville,It gets better with repeat viewings. An excellent examination of fame in America.
1.0,nashville,"Se voce fosse fazer um filme, por que ele sera diferente disso? Um retrato caustico dos EUA, mostra algo nao muito distinto do que e mostrado atualmente. Mas as atuacoes, as musicas, as falas, a edicao, o ritmo, transformam o retrato numa vertiginosa experiencia de imersao."
1.0,nashville,"My favorite Altman, next to ""The Player"" and ""Short Cuts."""
1.0,nashville,"A dense, riveting, and utterly unique meditation on American ego, music, and politics. Not to mention the best musical ending ever captured on film. For me, at least, this film is a completely religious experience."
1.0,nashville,An absolutely wonderful picture. Altman balances great use of comedy and drama in this mammoth story filmed with great performances and incredible music. A great piece of commentary on American culture. Anyone my age who is a fan of p.t. anderson would most likely love this film.
1.0,nashville,Lily Tomlin is as good at doing nothing in a bar as Robert Mitchum in Out of the Past.
1.0,nashville,"if you're being a dork and you're thinking about postmodern art, you ought to consider this film. it's amazing, particularly when you factor in that the music coming from this time and place is so piss-poor. It is the idea of this film and how it is executed that makes it great, not the subject."
1.0,nashville,One of the best ever
1.0,nashville,"Even 30 years later, one can still see the boundary pushing risky choices and amazing innovation of this film. Altman is the best thing to ever happen to American cinema, along with the 70's Scorsese."
0.0,nashville,"I'm not a big fan of Altman films. I wanted to enjoy this, it has excellent reviews. Horrible pacing, hokey dialogue, abrasive without a point. Excellent argument for not allowing the auteur final cut on a film."
1.0,nashville,"Nashville was one of the greatest movies on the 1970's and by virtue of that one of the greatest of all time. It was perfectly, cast, plotted and directed and was both dramatic and brilliantly funny. Along with M*A*S*H this is Altman's best."
0.0,nashville,Booooooooring! Robert Altman? Long winded. Country Music? Unpalitable. Jeff Goldbloom? What the heck?
1.0,nashville,ahhhh so good i cant even handle it.
1.0,nashville,"A dazzling patchwork with more brilliant performances than you see in some entire years. More than just a film, it's a time capsule for any study of American history or society in the 1970's"
1.0,nashville,"Such an incredible film. Great music, great cast. Just as timely now as it was in 1975."
1.0,nashville,"the best american film of the seventies.The scene where keith carradine sings i""m easy is an emotional rollercoaster.This should have been massive at the oscars."
1.0,nashville,"A brilliant sprawling American tragicomedy. Some of the music isn't first-rate, but it was largely written by the actors, so you can't really expect it to always be. First rate performances by everyone, interesting characters, and great directing and cinematography."
1.0,nashville,Everything about this film is perfect. It's Altman at his purest.
1.0,nashville,Perfection. The best.
1.0,nashville,"a disturbing critical look at the everything from our political climate, race, and gender. Upsetting looks at gender (for me). However only furthering my respect for Lily Tomlin!"
1.0,nashville,"I love all of Altman's films, but this one takes the cake. The music was great. The themes fit, even though I never would have expected them to. Altman is a master, and I felt completely inept while I was watching this. How could he have pulled it off?"
1.0,nashville,A dreamscape of an American era -- intoxicating and poignant.
1.0,nashville,A heartbreaking masterpiece. A brilliant ensemble piece. A brilliant love letter to the downtroded and neglected people of America that makes you laugh and tugs at your emotions.
1.0,nashville,"Arguably the masterpiece of the late Robert Altman this film has great atmosphere and music and haunting performances by Barbara Harris, Henry Gibson, Keith Carradine, Lily Tomlin and Ronee Blakely."

0.0,nashville,i should like altman but i don't. i just don't get him. i like what he does with sound though.
1.0,nashville,"a completely unique collage of an american city just on the verge of a descent into chaos and violence. it doesn't seem so immediately, but once you get to the end, you realize that everything in the film has been heading for this final act of horror."
1.0,nashville,Altman's masterpiece! One of the top 10 movies of the 70's.
1.0,nashville,One of Altman's best! Enjoyed the music very much! I've seen it long time ego..but still remember the scenes.That's something!
1.0,nashville,The best from one of the best.
1.0,nashville,Robert Altman's finest film. Sheer perfection.
1.0,nashville,"Best movie ever made, period. How Henry Gibson didn't score an Oscar nomination as Best Supporting Actor is anybody's guess...just when you think you hate Haven Hamilton...turns out he's the real deal. Barbara Harris/Shelley Duvall = priceless."
1.0,nashville,My Favorite Altman film. Great cast and script. Whatever happened to Karen Black?
1.0,nashville,"Not for everyone, but it is worth checking out if a friend thinks you will like it. It's my favorite of Altman's films."
1.0,nashville,Can be watched as a parody or as a serious drama. So many terrific characters and a real slice of life from the 70s before country became slick.
1.0,nashville,This film is about America.
1.0,nashville,"My all-time favorite film, as relevant to contemporary America as it was when it came out, and the soundtrack is still in my regular rotation. This is what the '70s felt like to me."
1.0,nashville,The most brilliant portrait of America on film.
1.0,nashville,"Unconventional and does everything wrong, but is still perfect."
1.0,nashville,Altman at his finest!

1.0,nashville,Masterpiece of conflicts interwoven within and between people
1.0,nashville,THIS IS A GREAT FILM!!! filled with life and energy interconnected stories involving the characters and yes country music is great in this film.
0.0,nashville,Three hours of my life I'll never get back... :(
1.0,nashville,"Robert Altman had an amazing ability to make you feel like you were 100% in the mix. Like you've been invited into a living, breathing world. I hate country music, okay? But I'd sit through this film anyday of the week."
1.0,nashville,"A suprisingly funny yet touching look at America, politics, life and music. An ensemble masterpiece."
1.0,nashville,...the best American film of the 70's in my opinion. RENT THIS.
1.0,nashville,Ett kaleidoskop av bild och ljud som aldrig upphör att fascinera. Altman mäktade tyvärr aldrig att matcha detta mästerverk.
1.0,nashville,it made country music an engaging experience for me. that's saying a lot.
1.0,nashville,"Everyone is a Supporting Actor. Then again, Life's nothing but a big movie with no main protagonists/antagonists but just supporting actors."
1.0,nashville,Altman's best film: a devastating piece of satire. The last 30 minutes are incredible. Ronee Blakley gives one of the all time best performances by anyone in any film ever. Geraldine Chaplin's somewhat ill-judged comic touch is the only significant flaw.
1.0,nashville,"My copy of this idea was stolen from me, anyone with any information on this may call the thief and ask him how many times he's seen this. Also, if you're thinking of buying this used, don't, its probably my copy."
1.0,nashville,"this is when I totally fell for Robert Altman. Ronee Blakley's character breaking down onstage left my mouth hanging open, in awe of both Blakley and Altman."
1.0,nashville,"Brilliantly made, its chaotic and yet it's so well done.The ending to this movie could not be more perfect."
1.0,nashville,"This is one of my favorite films of all time. I own it, and evertime I watch it I catch new connections and details. Maybe Altman's sets were chaotic, but if you pay close attention - there's genious in this film."
1.0,nashville,"So good. Crackling with energy, technically flawless, one of the best American films ever made."
1.0,nashville,"This is what Altman was capable of creating, the ultimate multi-line converging drama, everything that the Garrison Keillor movie wasn`t."
1.0,nashville,"Endlessly rewatchable, heart-wrenchingly tragic, bitterly funny. The brilliance of this movie comes out of nowhere, and it shocks me everytime. I get more out of it everytime I see it.This movie isn't ABOUT America, it IS America. 'Nuff said."
1.0,nashville,"you probably think it's too slow and doesn't have enough of a plot. but come on, the ending is incredible!"
1.0,nashville,This was a real trip... multiple stories all overlaid in politically and musically charged Nashville... The storyline between Lily Tomlin's character and Keith Carradine's character busted me up a bit... This was a spectacle...
1.0,nashville,"As long as we have politics and country music going, Nashville will remain relevant as a microcosm of America and its people."
1.0,nashville,One of Altman's best. Great performances by all.
1.0,nashville,An incredible piece of film making.
1.0,nashville,"Definitely a product of its time. A brilliant film from Altman, is that a surprise though? Entertaining and interesting at the same time. One of the best ensemble pieces to ever be filmed."
1.0,nashville,"A magnificent ensemble piece that may never be equaled. Flawless in all aspects, although it's not quite as timely today as it was in the 1970s."
1.0,nashville,"The highest point in Jeff Goldblum's illustrious career, and the best use of stars playing themselves in any film."
1.0,nashville,"The Darndest thing you ever saw. One of the funniest, most poignant and beautiful films ever made about the American dream."
1.0,nashville,Might be the best movie ever.
1.0,nashville,Might be my favorite movie.

1.0,nashville,Amazing! One of the very best movies I have ever watched in my life. This is Robert Altman's best.
1.0,nashville,One of the few movies that intertwines the lives of many characters while doing each of them justice. The ending sing-along is remarkably prescient.
1.0,nashville,"Altman's best? it's not out of the question. Great characters, great story, great direction and great songs, including the Oscar winning ""I'm Easy"" its great how in Altman's characters are all three dimensional because you can't help but feel that they have a life outside of the camera"
1.0,nashville,"One of the best movies about America, mainly because it doesn't let its politics get in the way of its humanity."
1.0,nashville,"24 characters' lives intertwine around country music and politics in the 5 days leading up to a presidential primary in the titular city. The film is essentially a country musical with touching, incisive and often hilarious social commentary between songs. Rousing, vital entertainment."

1.0,nashville,anyone who thinks this is boring or slow is missing the subtle genius. the best film ever made.
1.0,nashville,"greatest american movie ever made, perhaps. at least in the second half of the century, anyway. well i'm exaggerating but it's definitely good"

1.0,nashville,"First Altman film I ever saw, and as much as it confused the hell out of me that first viewing, I loved it, and I still love it."
1.0,nashville,"Nashville? What to say? A nearly perfect film. A true cross-section of the American psyche in the mid-70's . . . we need more films like this today, and less Transformers. Also, I wish I had a trike like Jeff Goldblum."
1.0,nashville,"The best film analysis of America ever made. If you liked Crash, you will love Nashville. The film is so well directed and acting is some of the best I have ever seen on screen. The format is a bit hard to take for people who are unfamiliar with Altman, but you get used to it."
1.0,nashville,Third greatest movie ever made. Period.
0.0,nashville,"I tried watching this, but I found it pretty mind-numbing."
1.0,nashville,Magnificent. One of the best American films ever made.
1.0,nashville,"Funny, Heart warming, good music, altman"
1.0,nashville,Flawless. What I consider to be a perfect film. Everything in it is tight as clockwork and Altman?s direction is executed with Swiss precision.
1.0,nashville,"A unbelievable cinematic experience without special effects. Moving between characters effectively, that you have a good understanding of who they are."
1.0,nashville,"If you have an afternoon to watch this, I highly recommend it. It actually bears repeat viewings."
1.0,nashville,"Totally unique. Totally Southern. Great ensemble cast, great direction, great music. Goldblum's character is one of the most riotously bizarre things I've ever seen on film. Yay for Altman!"
1.0,nashville,if there was a rating beyond 5 stars... this would get it. one of the best!
1.0,nashville,The greatest American movie ever made.
1.0,nashville,"About America on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Strangely patriotic too. Great performances from Altman's stock company but Tomlin, Carradine, Keenan Wynn, and Henry Gipson stand out."
1.0,nashville,Lily Tomlin should have won an Oscar just for the scene where she is crying in the back of the bar while Keith Carradine is singing to her.
1.0,nashville,"the best Altman film ever. . .even thirty years later, it still holds up."
1.0,nashville,"It's like the best party you weren't invited too. So much fun and brilliance, and yet at the end, leaves you feeling utterly depressed. You may say that I ain't free...but it don't worry me."
1.0,nashville,"I don't know if ""Nashville"" is an indictment or a celebration of America post-Vietnam and Watergate, but dammit, this is a terrific film. Altman is the director who knew how to observe better than any of the others. Truly remarkable."
1.0,nashville,One of the best American films ever.
1.0,nashville,A movie about one genre of music manages to explore every angle of the era. Mandatory screening for any film student.
1.0,nashville,"When I went through my Robert Altman phase, I was jealous that he made a film like this and Short Cuts. I mean, he made Nashville and Short Cuts and we complain when he makes O.C and Stiggs and the (under-rated) Popeye!! Just remember that he made Nashville and try and watch it once a year."
1.0,nashville,"i miss you, mr. altman. thank you for being brilliant up to the very end."

1.0,nashville,"""He's got a tapedeck in his tractor"""
1.0,nashville,Altman's only good film AND one of the best of the 1970s.
1.0,nashville,"Altman's finest film. It's really difficult to explain what's so amazing about it. There are great characters, great dialog, great acting, but even that doesn't do it justice. You have to witness it for yourself."
1.0,nashville,"A shattering, brilliant movie, with flaws that would be virtues in other films. One of Altman's best."
1.0,nashville,The most affecting ensemble ever assembled.
1.0,nashville,"You know all that crap you hear about the films of the 70s changing everything? This one proves it. Altman's masterpiece, and unlike anything you've ever seen."
1.0,nashville,Perfect in every way.
0.0,nashville,I'll consider my life complete once I dance on Altman's grave.
1.0,nashville,Robert Altman's scathing expose of American politics is still as resonant today as it was in 1975. It has a brilliant cast and is masterfully directed.
1.0,nashville,More great performances per square yard than any other film ever made - though special credit has to go to Geraldine Chaplin as the ridiculous Opal. Robert Altman has a sharp satirical eye and a great feel for place. Anyone who enjoys this should check out 'The Long Goodbye' as well.
1.0,nashville,What can I say about this picture that hasn't already been said?
1.0,nashville,Touching and ripe for analysis. Altman's best film after McCabe and Mrs. Miller.
1.0,nashville,the best movie ever. period.
1.0,nashville,'It don't worry me.'

1.0,nashville,"The subtle humor, the great filmmaking, the wonderful acting, ""I'm Easy"" for this great movie"
1.0,nashville,"No beginning, no middle no end, no main character, Brilliant!"
1.0,nashville,RONEE FRIGGIN BLAKLEY!!!! I love this movie.
1.0,nashville,"Wasn't a fan of this the first time around, but it's grown on me and, while perhaps not Altman's greatest technical achievement, is perhaps my favorite of his films. The final scene is transcendent."
1.0,nashville,Robert Altman's best. I'm greatly inspired by this movie.

1.0,dig,A ne pas manquer ! inoubliable et décapant !

1.0,dig,"Love the brianjonestown massacre, great documentary set over 10 years. Proper in depth to a creative mind and a control freak. Really worth seeing."
1.0,dig,"Great doco on the Dandy Warhols and Brian Jonestown Massacre. Better on the second watching when I wasn't so distracted by the music. Even if you're not a fan of the bands, watching the ongoing relationship/rivalry between two bands over several years is worth it."
1.0,dig,"This doc focuses on two bands over the course of seven years. The footage in this is unbelievable and one of a kind. Whether or not you care for Brian Jonestown or the Dandy Warhols, few documentaries can capture a dysfunctional band's beginnings and have such extreme moments as this one."
1.0,dig,"a classic documentary about drugs, music and success. Highly recommended to the weed-consuming musicale."
1.0,dig,Warning: This movie will make you want to quit your job and become a rock star.

1.0,dig,"BJM...I bought the shirt and when I wear it out it gets weird looks. Shouldnt everyone have a shirt with big letters spelling ""Massacre""? This doc gave me a new appreciation for music."
1.0,dig,This is probably the best music related documentary ever!!! Save the Beatles Anthology. But I dare any of you to watch it and not want to buy a BJM album.
1.0,dig,A near perfect rock and roll documentary.
1.0,dig,Anton is a genius...loony as the loony tunes but amazing!!! Joels sunglasses alone are worth watching it for
1.0,dig,"so good, if you want to learn about acting like a rockstar/douchebag."
1.0,dig,This is my 2nd viewing of Dig & I enjoyed it even more this time around. Compelling viewing.
1.0,dig,I want be Joel Gion!
1.0,dig,Just watched this and thought it was great. Who said the real Rock'n'Roll star is dead.
1.0,dig,I less than three these bands
1.0,dig,"One of the best music documentaries made, definitely my favorite. I highly recommend seeing this film."
1.0,dig,"Awesome! Even if Anton is not ultimately pleased with his depiction, it is a great documentary featuring amazing music. Do you DIG!?"
1.0,dig,Joel Gion the Keith Richards of the 90's!!!
1.0,dig,"Le BJM ce sont des gens perturbés, qui font de la bonne musique"
1.0,dig,"A great music documentary filmed over the course of seven years. A great introspective into how one band continues its modest success, while another -- The Brian Jonestown Massacre fails, time and time again.Sex, drugs, and rock & roll."
1.0,dig,A sadly underrated documentary that offers a fascinating study of the tragically self-destructive Anton Newcome.
1.0,dig,Best Part: At the end when Anton punts a fans head.
1.0,dig,One of Favorite movie
1.0,dig,"Brilliant, bizarre, full of great music. Anton..strange dude indeed."
1.0,dig,one of the best music documentaries i've ever seen. fucking awesome.
1.0,dig,stop reading this and go watch it
1.0,dig,possibly the best documentary i've ever seen.
1.0,dig,The best documemtary about being a rock star ever made...funny/sad/shocking...Joel Gion makes Bez look like an ASBO puppet. Brilliant.
1.0,dig,Greatest movie I have ever seen. BJM RUlES
1.0,dig,This is one of those documentaries that's actually fun to watch. Also I love both the Dandys and BJM :]
1.0,dig,Dig this rivieting band doco! I loved the Dandy's music before I watched this. After I purchased BJM and Teppid Peppermint is my most played album of this year! I love the music but I'd never share a house with or be in a band with Anton
1.0,dig,"I love both bands this doc follows and love to hate this film. Its an excellent movie based on entertainment alone, just quite a bit misleading about the relationship between the bands."
1.0,dig,et en vrai c est encore mieux !le rock n est pas mort !!!
0.0,dig,Hugely boring. Dragged on so much and all you really get from it is that Dandy Warhols were successful and BJM weren't. Anton Newcombe was an idiot and was overrated. Awful.
1.0,dig,This is an awesome movie about Music and Drugs and the people that do both.
1.0,dig,If you want to know how NOT to be an asshole. Watch this movie! Its really awesome.
1.0,dig,fucking great. i loved it.
1.0,dig,"I love how it shows the different tracks bands can take--one who chooses to focus on the music, and one who sells out and gets big. I still prefer BJM way more than the Dandy Warhols. Although I still kind of don't like how they vilified Anton."
1.0,dig,"More documentaries need to be made like this, is it 100% truthful? I don't care."
1.0,dig,"Totally totally gripping, made me spend forever looking up bands and finding new music as well! Reminded me of loads of people I know as well!"
1.0,dig,"Of course Anton says that this is bullshit and all against him and all that. But either way, it's entertaining as hell. I've never had a problem when seeing the BJM live. someone said that neither band is good live or something...are you joking? lol jeez."
1.0,dig,"Dandy Warhols are the bomb. Brian Jonestown Massacre are terrific, Anton is one of the greatest songwriters of the last decade, at least. GO SEE THESE BANDS LIVE. Both are a truly unique experience."
1.0,dig,"Anton comes across as a tit....but that music, I could forgive him anything when BJM actually get around to playing."
1.0,dig,Don't you just love BJM and hate those fey Dandys? Anton Newcombe comes out the winner in this despite it's obvious attempts to rubbish him. Those Dandys really are sad people. And how could anyone who has a friend like Miranda Lee Richards not be a great guy?
1.0,dig,Rock 'n Roll is fat and ugly and I love it.
1.0,dig,"Best rockumentory i've seen. It follows The Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols, and the friendship/rivalry relation between them for about 7 years"
1.0,dig,Fascinating...any self-respecting music fan has to see this movie immediately.
1.0,dig,Another reason for the Dandy Warhols to thank Anton..
1.0,dig,best rock and roll documentary ever made hands down. this is a true labor of love.
1.0,dig,"Fave line: ""You fucking broke my sitar, motherfucker!"""
1.0,dig,"One of my favs of all time. Who is better the dandies that got signed @ in the hole for $450,000 for one video OR The BJM that self destructs with every live performance. This movie will leave you saying ""Thank God For Mental Illness""!"
1.0,dig,best doc ever! Love the Courtney Taylor/Anton relationship... and not to mention Peter Hayes!
1.0,dig,"joel gion is cooler than all of the people on earth. i mean, minus the coke/heorin- hes pretty much, well...umm, badass.obviously."
1.0,dig,"Everyone who watches this movie is going to take something from it, but everyone is going to take something different. ""Dig!"" is a perfect rock-doc... I can't wait to show this film to my classes!"
1.0,dig,This is now one of my favorite movies. it is probably the coolest doc i have ever seen.
1.0,dig,Dig! is one of the best rock n roll films ever made.
1.0,dig,Good 1 to see if you're into the rock crazed 'Dandy Warhols' and 'The Brian Jonestown Massacre' and want an insight into what makes them tick...dig?I'm a big fan.
1.0,dig,best Rock-Doc EVER!!!!
1.0,dig,"one of (if not the) most honest documentaries I've ever seen. It's even a bit touching, watching fame and drug abuse separate two good friends and ultimately cause a really great band to be left in the dust"
1.0,dig,dandy awrhols and the brian jonestown massacre...yum
1.0,dig,"Very interesting doc. on two great bands. Anton Newcome is the man, as much as my friend Charlie may disagree."
1.0,dig,one of the best docs i have ever seen.
1.0,dig,"Essential rockumentary charting the contrasting fortunes of The Brian Jonestown Massacre and The Dandy Warhols. Funny, shocking insight into the biz. Anton is on self-destruct but his music is touched by genius."
1.0,dig,hella biased against the bjm but still very good.
1.0,dig,"Absolutely the best rock documentary ever, bar none."
1.0,dig,"in my quieter moments, i like indie pop bands who steal ideas from other bands and start small scale revolutions... so i give this 5 stars"
1.0,dig,"so while watching the bjm a couple of years ago at mary janes in houston, anton was getting pissed at the audience and yells ""i'll kick you in the face. you know i'll fucking do it."" it was a riot. he also said ""i may be a cunt, but i'm not a fucking cunt."" this movie makes me smile."
0.0,dig,"One of, if not THE worst movie of all time. Pompous and ugly, with terrible terrible music."
1.0,dig,"Awesome, awesome, awesome!"
1.0,dig,"hate that is was from the dandy's perspective and is a bunch of shit like Antone said, but it is worth a watch just to see Newcomb's little bitch fits."
1.0,dig,"Making a good rock and roll documentary is hard. The Kids Are Alright is probably top of the list, but there are lots of close seconds. This is definitely in the top two for me. Makes Spinal Tap look like juicy fruit."
1.0,dig,One of the best rock-uumentaries. Absolute nutcases but nothing better then seeing nerdy yank geeks smacking the shit out of each other in unconvincing ways.
1.0,dig,"A brilliant examination of the ego and the id. Anton Newcombe shows brilliance as a musician and failure as a human being, probably the best music documentary ever..."
1.0,dig,"craziness, drugs, muzak. good good documentary."
1.0,dig,"Well, I love the dandys, so, ITS AWESOME GO!!! WATCH IT NOW!!!"
1.0,dig,"If not for this movie, I'd never heard of the BJM."
1.0,dig,This will remind you why music is so important in everyday life.
1.0,dig,"Best music documentary I've ever seen. Great, even if you don't like either band. Also a great cautionary tale about drugs and mental illness. Don't do drugs, kids. And seek therapy."
1.0,dig,Best documentary following a rock group ever made. Anton Newcombe mails The Dandy Warhols shot gun shells with their names written on them. Awesome.
1.0,dig,"i love this movie. nice view of what it takes for artists to develop careers albeit very different ones. the dandy's rule, ok..."
1.0,dig,Possibly the best Rockumentary I've ever seen. Anton is such a twat but he's hilarious to watch.
1.0,dig,Just watch it! DiG! Will be the best rockumentary for many years to come and with good reason.
1.0,dig,An excellent if one sided doc.
1.0,dig,"This is just an amazing music doc about respect and rivalry between Anton Newcombe and Courtney Taylor-Taylor. Great music, just a really fucking awesome film. A must-see for indie music fans."
1.0,dig,Rett og slett genialt! Naken og ærlig.... ...and what a bunch of fuckups!!:p
1.0,dig,Best rock and roll documentary ever made.
1.0,dig,I've seen it 6 times.
1.0,dig,This film gets better with every watch although it does somewhat sell itself out with a scripted narrative from Courtney Taylor and a clearly bias view towards the BJM nevertheless a compulsive watch...
1.0,dig,It makes you hate them all. Don't do drugs.
1.0,dig,joel gion is my hero.
1.0,dig,"One of my fav's. Made me want to get my guitar and live the dream. Seriously, if you're into music, even if you don't like the style, watch it! I already liked Dandy Warhols and it also got me to worship BJM."
1.0,dig,Amazing documentary. One of my favorite movies ever.
1.0,dig,"you could watch this 20 times and not be bored, honest."
1.0,dig,"this movie pretty much shaped my life in the world of music. definately one of the best music documentries around. one thing i didnt like about it was how out of order it was, but it still makes for a great story."
1.0,dig,"Very good movie. Very interesting story of how record label executives are lying, cocky jerks."
1.0,dig,This is a textbook case of an awesome documentary. Great if you're a fan of the Brian Jonestown Massacre or the Dandy Warhols or just indie music in general
1.0,dig,the dandy warhols love almost everyone...
1.0,dig,"Rock n roll is alive, even if you don't think these bands rock."
1.0,dig,"Great documentary, I did go off the dandy's after this, long live the brian jones town."
1.0,dig,"If you dont love this movie, you are inhuman. With lines like ""He stole my fucking Citar"" and ""I dont like being robbed, stealin from people is highly illegal."" who cannot love the incredibly self-destructive Anton Newcombe"
1.0,dig,Two bands living the dream.
1.0,dig,Awesome. Two of my favorite bands + a hint of BRMC.
1.0,dig,The Dandy's are amazing
1.0,dig,This documentary was done very well... a lot of time was put into it. a definite great watch for any fan of the Dandys or BJM.
1.0,dig,"engrossing, hilarious, impressively crafted documentary"
1.0,dig,Possibly the best rockumentary you will ever have the pleasure of viewing.Perhaps a little flexible with the truth but achieves it's goal perfectly.
1.0,dig,"Perfect movie for anyone who wants to be involved in the music business, and a great story about one of American rock's most under appreciated bands."
1.0,dig,Perhaps my favorite documentary.
1.0,dig,"One of the most amazing documentaries... it helps if you are into the Dandy warhols, or Brian Jonestown massacre. If you aren't it's still rocks as hard as its true life Characters."
1.0,dig,"Very entertaining and different kind of rock documentary. I like how it focusses on the parallel successes/failures of two seperate, but superficially connected bands. The music (on both sides) is fantastic as well!"
1.0,dig,Courtney-courtney Taylor changed his name because some episode at a hotel. I wish that was in this movie. Joel Gion is a tambourine man. The chick that plays topless for the dandy's is such a dumpster vag. I wanna pour hot sauce down her ears till she hears the burning burning love of my tio: Tapa!
1.0,dig,"Umm... this has the Dandy Warhols in it. Who gives a shit what it is, it has to be a masterpiece. And it is."
1.0,dig,I could watch this doc over and over.
1.0,dig,"Brian Jonestown Massacre is amazing, too bad they beat each others asses too much"
1.0,dig,"a great documentary follows two great bands. one charmed, one cursed. incredible ironic reality."
1.0,dig,Documentary about one of my favorite bands- The Dandy Warhols!
1.0,dig,Love this really great encapsulates certain aspects of the music scene
1.0,dig,The greatest rock n roll film ever about the coolest most under-rated band. And I'm not talking about the Dandy Warhols. Anton Newcombe is genius. Period.
1.0,dig,both of these bands are sweet
1.0,dig,"Hello? A movie about the Dandy Warhols!? I'm obliged to give it 5 stars. But it was good. And Anton, what a freak... i love musos"
1.0,dig,Awesome documentary.
1.0,dig,See the antics of Anton!
1.0,dig,Best freakin rockumentary ever.
1.0,dig,dude i broke my fucking sitar
1.0,dig,Greatest movie about a band ever. The brian jonestown massacre and dandy warhols are SOOOOOOO AWESOME!!!!!!!!!
1.0,dig,Absolute class. Worth the watch just for the sheer loose cannon that is Anton Newcombe of the Brian Jonestown Massacre.
1.0,dig,Best documentary film of all time!
1.0,dig,Interesting documentary
1.0,dig,"YAY such a cool movie, such great music...yay for the dandy warhols :)"
1.0,dig,One of the greatest rock-docs ever!

1.0,topsyturvy,i remember this movie not being anything i had expected but watching it twice in one day because i simply wanted to hang out with these characters and locales again. i was only thirteen at the time to boot. weird to think of the stuff i was into back then. a really underrated little movie.

1.0,topsyturvy,"I thought I would find this all too fluffy for me, but it held my attention with Leighs excellent cast which he uses time and time again"

1.0,topsyturvy,so good! even though its a 90's film its based in the 1800's.

1.0,five_easy_pieces,"An incredibly minimalistic, but unbelievably deep character study about a man who takes his own path in life, not the easy one laid out for him from the start. Achingly relatable to all, but profoundly moving to others, it's arguably one of the finest American films ever made."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"One of the best films that I've ever seen! It discusses the human condition in a bold, yet delicate manner. ""I want you to hold it between your knees!"""

1.0,five_easy_pieces,Tour de Force Nicholson. The original drifter. This is a must.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,Five Easy Pieces remains one of the defining character portraits of the 1970s. Jack Nicholson gives one of his best performances.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,perfect. my favorite jack role in one of favorite films.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,Mighty performance of Jack Nocholson.Shall not miss it
1.0,five_easy_pieces,One of the great classics of American cinema.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"Hasn't aged a day... except for it being the 70's and all. Arguably Nicholson's most wide-varied of great performances. He's funny, he's tragic, he's rebelious, he's subtle, he's existential, he's huggable lovable and eatable. Perhaps I've gone too far..."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,One of the very best films to come out of the seventies. It contains one of the best performances of Jack Nicholson on Film.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,Hilarious + tragic + brilliantly acted + way ahead of its time = one of the greatest films ever.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"The best performance Jack Nicholson has ever given, and one of the best films of the 70's. This film is able to get to the core of it's character better than most films I've seen, and the result is a deeply moving character study, that really left an impact on me."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,jack nicholson... best actor ever.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,One of the greatest movies ever made.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"""Where do you get the ass to tell anybody anything about class, or who the hell's got it, or what she typifies? You shouldn't even be in the same room with her, you pompous celibate. You're totally full of shit! You're all full of shit."""
1.0,five_easy_pieces,An American film about class differences and a man caught in between working and middle...sounds dull but is actually superb. JN does a great angry performance in the diner (famously) but what is he really angry about? That is the question at the heart of this and it unfolds nicely.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,One of my all time favorite movies.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"""i don't even want to talk about it!""i love netflix instant."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,I thought this was great.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"A classic everyone should see. One of Jack Nicholson's greatest films, easily."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,This is a milestone movie. Nicholson is awesome. the dialogue brilliant and the chicken sandwich scene is something we can all relate to. Haha...
1.0,five_easy_pieces,Jack Nicholson at his best. This film is simple but so complex. The characters feel real emotion about issues that people face everyday. Bobby's need to run is something we can all relate to. Karen Black is a knock out and sufficiently unintelligent in the part of Rayette.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"keep on tellin me about the good life Elton, 'cause it makes me puke--classic line"
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"wow. this was great. jack nicholson was really, really good. maybe my favorite performance from him. a very simple film, but really interesting characters. the ending was great."

1.0,five_easy_pieces,hold the chicken between your knees
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"When one thinks of the ""New Hollywood"" of the 70's this is one of the films that comes to mind. How did the Hollywood film industry produce something like this? It's alot to do with the writer Carole Eastman - (not Bob Rafelson) who wrote the script specifically for Jack."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"This one was hard to watch. it hit way to close to home for me, but i cant deny its an amazing movie and is truly depressing. Jack does a very nice job, an overall winner"
1.0,five_easy_pieces,Squirmingly great drama with Nicholson as usual stealing the show. I love family dramas with lots of angst and dysfunction...and this one delivered. I loved Robert's wanderlust as well as the overarching theme of self-discovery and the choices that give us freedom as individuals. Bravo.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,Portrait of an Asshole. Loved it. Loved the Vancouver Island scenes too.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"Podria decirse que es la mejor actuacion en la carrera de Jack Nicholson. Un profundo y complejo examen acerca de Robert Duprea, su busqueda interior y su intento de comunicarse con alguien. La escena de la cafeteria es inmortal."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,Good story. BBS makes good films.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,Jo believes this to be me - I wish
1.0,five_easy_pieces,An excellent film. If anyone has doubts about why Jack Nicholson is considered one of the best.. watch this film! (After a rewatch it gets the 5)
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"Five Easy Pieces is alot to absorb in one viewing. I fell asleep the first time because I wasn't expecting a slow paced character study, however the second time I realized what I was getting myself into and I saw why Ebert and others had made such a big deal. Watch twice"
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"Jack Nicholson's best performance, and one of his best films. A must-see!"
1.0,five_easy_pieces,If you like simple sentimentality and easily understood characters...waddle back to the Disney Buffet.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"So simple, yet so complex. A truly great film from the '70's."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"One of Jack Nicholson's finest hours from the decade where he could do no wrong. Sadly he seems to be content making substandard pap like Something's Gotta Give these days, with only the occasional gem, for eg. About Schmidt, The Pledge."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"It's so rare to see films about resignation... nowadays everyone in a film has to be ""confident"" and together, or hysterically sad. Here's a story about a man who just... walks away, and not because of principles (although they are involved) or fear or trouble... he just walks away."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,Nicholson gives one of his most risky and subtle performances as a piano virtuoso torn between two lifestyles.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"So cool and quiet. Every scene comes together like music. He hurts, he doesn't care, and it makes sense. Nothing happens, everything happens."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,Unconvential tale of misery and woe is fully excuted with this brillant movie.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,thats veeeeeeery personal
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"Granted this was crafted more as a breakout, star vehicle for the unknown Jack but still, such a powerful film. ""Rae why don't you take that sign off your tit and get me another beer""."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,By far Jack Nicholson's best performance....
1.0,five_easy_pieces,one of the best character studies ever.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"I looove this movie. Jack Nicholson is by far one of the most emotional actors I've seen, and the music is brilliant."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"What a jerk but really sexy,and I loved the chick in the back seat ""filth nothing but filth"""
1.0,five_easy_pieces,There is something about this period of filmmaking that turned out some truly inspired masterpieces and this is one of the best. Nicholson at his finest.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"In my top two (or three) Nicholson performances. Somehow, he makes me want to be Dupea; even with his troubled existence, I see a great freedom that many people in this world are never able to achieve."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"As alternately subtle and in-your-face as real life. At its core, very sad and very important. I don't trust people who ""don't get"" this movie."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,The plot is unexceptional. Nothing particularly spectacular happens and effectively it's brilliant for it. This is 70's realism at it's best. Thanks Rafelson for not indulging us with a pivitol character resolution cause it's worth more than that.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,cosmic american cinema to the max. perfection!
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"Nicholson mesmerizes as a musical prodigy who seems to prefer the life of a drifter in this subtle meditation on talent squandered---or on the tragic inability of talent alone to secure happiness. Angry, angsty and most of all literate, it's far more than a memorable chicken-salad joke."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,easily one of the most important american films. even as a kid this blew me away.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,the perfect example of a cosmic american movie.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"Nicholson walks away with the whole dang show in this compelling drama, which is nicely understated but never boring, buoyed along by a good sense of humor."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,Don't read any plot summaries before you see this film.
0.0,five_easy_pieces,"Nicholson is good, but the writing is laughable. Couldn't finish it."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"This is Jack Nicholson in his prime. He has two worlds, but he belongs in neither of them. Amazing movie."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"That's right, crush that one too, then i won't have any.Great, GREAT piece of film. Don't think i've ever seen anything like it. I'm going to knock everything else that was a five down to four."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"This is the film everyone thinks Easy Rider is - Nicholson at his powerful best, this subtle dip into the ephemeral life of middle America launched the American Decade and was never surpassed"
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"About lost souls, I guess. It's very funny and utterly real. Gotta see it. Christ, look at the stuff Nicholson is in nowadays... See him before he became 'Jack'."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"It's a strange movie. I mean, what does it come down to? If a person has no love for himself, no respect for himself, no love of his friends, family, work, something - how can he ask for love in return? I mean, why should he ask for it?"
1.0,five_easy_pieces,jack nicholson fucks everyone
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"A masterpiece in every sense of the word, from the direction/writing of Rafelson, to the acting of Nicholsen/Black, this is definitely a film that still hits you even to this day."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,A Nicholson classic!
1.0,five_easy_pieces,Maybe I relate too much to the character played by Jack Nicholson to have an objective opinion of this film...maybe.A masterpiece.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,Nicholson plays amazing in this movie. great scene of him on the truck playing piano. complex character over all a must see!
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"alongside deniro and hackman, nicholson was the best actor of his time. a classic 70's mood piece. bob rafelson also did a criminally underknown flick with nicholson around this time called ""the king of marvin gardens,"" which is similar to Atlantic City, and in my opinion, better."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,This film is worth it just for the scene where Jack Nicholson orders a tomato sandwich. Absolutely brilliant.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,Pretty wild film... Talk about a lone rider...
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"If you've forgotten how amazing Nicholson can be, rent this. It's also a testament Karen Black's beauty and abilities."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"A film that is as true to it's theme now, as it was then. A must see character study."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,Very personal film for me.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,The beginning of the 1970's had this movie. Which is one of the greatest of the 70's. If not the greatest. Understated magic.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"I love this film despite the strangely tolerated violence during the sex scene. Apology scene rips the heart out. One of Nicholson's greatest on screen moments in my eyes. Also, one of the best last shot's of any movie ever made."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"It surprises me the number of people who haven't seen Rafelson's amazing film. Truly a calm, slow, realistic depiction of a man's life. A character study more than anything. It doesn't hurt that Nicholson is at his strongest either."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,My favorite Jack Nicholson role. The diner scene alone makes it one of my favorite movies.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,The saddest ending in cinema.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"kid has bunch of talents, world not interested in any of them, he has to decide what to do, if anything, anyway..."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,An elegaic ode to a drifter.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"A really interesting character study, it's a deep emotional film that really makes you hate and feel sorry for Jack Nicholson's character. Well done 70's flick."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"I move around a lot, not because I'm looking for anything really, but 'cause I'm getting away from things that get bad if I stay."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,Such a mess of a person. I wonder why I indentify with that?
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"Jack wants a sandwich his way, burger king style."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,another great 70's film that deals with the theme of alienation. after watching this film you wanna give a big 'fuck you' to existence
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"This movie really reminds me of J.D. Salinger's books- the family full of genius, but incapable of relating to normal life. Nicholson is a grown up Holden Caulfield- his alienation growing into an incapability to commit or even love someone genuinely."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,The greatest ending of all time and Nicholson is genius! Raffelson is an unsung hero.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,great movie and one where jack nicholson isn't the only thing that saved it.....i like how the scenes tell the story....its show not tell
1.0,five_easy_pieces,one of jack's best - another film they could never get away with making these days. thank god for the movies of the 70's.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,I love this movie. The toast scene is one of my favourite movie scenes of all time.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"In the fashion of good old character pieces, Five Easy Pieces stands up in the pinnacle. Simple, yet tragicly deep."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,Turned me on to Nicholson as one of the greatest actors ever. Awesome movie
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"Quoting Anthony Coppa:""So cool, and quiet. Every scene comes together like music. He hurts, he doesn't care, and it makes sense. Nothing happens, everything happens."" This is the perfect description ever for this movie.Probably one of the best endings in cinema's history."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"the best film jack has ever done. this was before he was ""jack"" and was really trying."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"One of the top 20 movies of all time. I love most of the characters in this picture, more than most films I've seen. Jack Nicholson's character is such a great portrayal of a man who doesn't know what he wants and doesn't really want to be anyplace at all. Some fantastic scenes and smart dialogue."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,Superlative character study & my favorite Nicholson film.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,An unknown early post Easy Riders Jack classic
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"Prodigy returns after mind-numbing work to family reunification in doubt of direction but with a well demonstrated redressing of their contributions to humanity. OK..Arty Farty..but it's Jack and he gets to say ""why don't you put the bread between your legs.."""
1.0,five_easy_pieces,Jack Nicholson's best performance and one of the best cinematic character studies ever made.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"An American masterpiece. Unforgettable ending. Nicholson's narcissism takes a back seat to heavy-weight acting, and man, does he have some chops."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,One of the most insightful films of that decade.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"Nicholson himself says it best:  FUCK! SHIT! BITCH! CUNT! FUCK! SHIT! STUPIDFUCKINGBITCHASS FUCK SHIT BITCH! MOTHERFUCKER!  In other words: This movie is a gosh darn masterpiece, and if you don't like it then I probably don't want to be friends with you."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,Bob Raeflson used to be so cool.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,Nicholson gives one of the best performances in American film. This is an overlooked classic.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"Forget everything else, this is Nicholson's finest hour. Truly great and unfairly forgotten film."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,Nicholson as a do whatever he wants fuck-up is brilliant. Perfect for anyone thinking of quitting their job.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"Jacks best film to date, sadly forgotten"
1.0,five_easy_pieces,This movie changed my life.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,Jack was beyond fantastic in this film! A must see.....
1.0,five_easy_pieces,Condon Award: Best Movie of 1970
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"A work of genius from Bob Rafelson, spearheading the New American cinema movement. Easily one of Nicholson's finest performances. Absolute quality if you like 'proper' films :)"
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"""..because she's so twinky!"""
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"Reveals character without resorting to melodrama. This is before Nicholson became a charicture of himself. Possibly his best performance. The story touches on a universal anxiety, that is rarely explored in film."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"Arguably Jack Nicholson's best performance of his career. The diner scene has me cracking up every time, and always makes me want to order my food just like Nicholson does. Great film."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,I want you to hold it between your knees!
1.0,five_easy_pieces,Stands alone. No other big budget movie tackles class issues like this one.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,This movie is the truth.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"Easily one of my favorite films of all time. This, to me, is the best Jack Nicholson performance. Better than ""Cuckoo's"" better than ""Chinatown"" and better than anything else. This defines the 70's era of film, arguably the best decade."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,easily one of my favorite movies about a guy misunderstood...
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"Classic and beautiful work of Jack Nicholson, before he was typecast as ""Jack""."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,Nicholson's finest performance! One of the great films of the 1970's! The greatest film made by Bob Rafelson and BBS Productions.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,No one can throw out a sting of barely intelligible obsceneties like Nicholson.... NO ONE!
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"Deceptively simple, definitely brilliant."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,Like Rebel Without a Cause but better.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,Funniest movie about a runaway. Doesn't annoy me at all. One day i will tell a waitress to hold a chiken between her legs. It's on my list of things to do before I die.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"Perhaps my favorite character study, this is the story of a man with no hope, no direction in life, and no self-respect. While much of 1970s cinema centered on anti-heroes, Robert DuPea was closer to a sub-hero."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"A low key character study of a man who chooses his own life rather than follow a preconceived destiny. Maybe Jack Nicholson's best performance ever, and easily one of my favourite movies of all time."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,Nicholson at his dispicable best.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,Nicholson at his explosive best.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"""you want me to hold the chicken?""  ""I want you to hold it in between your knees...""  God I love Nicholson in this movie"
1.0,five_easy_pieces,completely absorbing piece of 70's filmmaking. requires patience tho
1.0,five_easy_pieces,One of my all time favorite movies. Jack Nicholson is amazing in this movie. This was before he was a huge star. Awsome character study. Watch for the Chicken salad sandwich scene.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,Best movie. Ever. The soundtrack is awesome too
1.0,five_easy_pieces,One of Jack Nicholson's best performances.
1.0,five_easy_pieces,Great fucking movieand incidentally my life
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"The third greatest film ever made. Robert Eroica Dupea is one of the most complex characters in all of cinema. Full of hilarious and heartbreaking moments, as this restless soul charms and disappoints everyone who comes close to him."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"People. Animals are not like that. They're always cleaning themselves. Did you ever see, umm... pigeons? Well, he's always picking on himself and his friends. They're always picking bugs out of their hair all the time. Monkeys too. Except they do something out in the open that I don't go for."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,angsty but what an ending
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"Great film, quintessential film of the 70's led by a terrific performance by Jack"
1.0,five_easy_pieces,"I think this is Jack Nicholson's best performance. So many great scenes, and the ending is perfect, too."
1.0,five_easy_pieces,Jack at his best. 70s dissilusionment at it's most pointed.

1.0,beats_rhymes_and_life_the_travels_of_a_tribe_called_quest,"Much like the conflict that surrounds the narrative of the documentary, the negative media which the documentary received did nothing to lessen this great foray into the exploration of the story and passion behind A Tribe Called Quest."
1.0,beats_rhymes_and_life_the_travels_of_a_tribe_called_quest,"Unbelievable ... I didn't remember Phife having diabetes and figured they broke up in 98 just cause, like all bands break up. So good. Perfectly produced, directed and cut, like The Low End Theory."

1.0,la_la_land,"A sensational tale of every star. While the end was obvious, what wasn't was the chemistry between the two leads and their relationship was true fantasy. Homage to classic Hollywood is good, but this movie is what classic Hollywood was."
0.0,la_la_land,Seriously lacking plot line that fails to hold the audiences attention. A huge waste of money to tell a bland story.

0.0,la_la_land,To be honest I?m not really into music calls so I am not keen on this movie because there?s just way too much Music so I just took it as a musical that I did not find interesting
1.0,la_la_land,"Emma's tour de force performance, Chazelle's masterful direction and the wonderful score make the film truly delightful.For short, the best film of 2016."
0.0,la_la_land,"This was a terrible movie, just proof that the academy awards are all about hollywood insiders stroking each other and not about rewarding the best movies. Self indulgent, agonizing tripe. Watching Emma Stone attempt to dance and sing is nothing short of painful."
1.0,la_la_land,"Definetly one of the best movies I've ever seen. I went in to the movie completely blank, and got out totally devastated. It has beautiful music, a great story and a fantastic look. I went to La La Land in Concert the other day, and I'm totally in love with this movie even more now."
1.0,la_la_land,"With great acting and memorable songs, La La Land shows that Whiplash isn't the only piece of evidence that proves that Damien Chazelle is a talented film maker."

1.0,la_la_land,La La Land is a movie that is built perfectly to get you to feel what it feels. The choreography and music is beautiful and loud when it needs to be and quiet and subtle when it wants to be. You are pulled through a story of emotion and love and the ending leaves you wanting more.

1.0,la_la_land,"Flirtatious, unforced and matter-of-factly upbeat. Damien Chazelle casually constructs one classic scene after another. A confident segue from his brilliantly edited ""Whiplash""; can we expect a Chazelle ""Jazz Trilogy""?"

0.0,la_la_land,"Love the lead actors but hated the songs and fantasy aspect. It came across as pretentious and boring. If it had been a regular movie instead of a musical, I probably would have liked it."

0.0,la_la_land,"A display of America's self-indulgent, self-congratulatory, fatuous culture. That it has been so highly acclaimed by critics says so much about how profoundly the USA has lost its way. It's beautiful to look at, but empty of meaning. So sad."

1.0,la_la_land,"Let me say I am not usually a fan of musicals, but I love this movie. It's a perfect balance between reality and fantasy and it's incredible how a lot of things said in the beginning come back and connect in the end. As Sebastian says, ""it's conflict and compromise."""

0.0,la_la_land,This movie was so cheesy I fail to see why people liked it.

1.0,who_killed_the_electric_car,Karma is biting GM in the backside right now. I guess that is what you get for killing the electric car. Down with the establishment. On a side note: Probably the best movie with Ed Begley Jr. in it.
1.0,who_killed_the_electric_car,It really makes you wonder how far people will go for the almighty dollar. Profit before people and common sense.
1.0,who_killed_the_electric_car,"Well put together and I generally agree with most of the conclusions, there are some hippie-esique points and ""do good [and know little] actors"" that I found distracting, but for a documentary and one that deals with environmental issues this film was light years beyond most and well worth a watch."

1.0,who_killed_the_electric_car,"If you are interested in energy conservation, annoyed at gas prices and big oil companies, this movie will really get under your skin. Amazing how an entire nation can have this electric car virtually wiped from their memories. As soon as I saw the EV1, I remembered them (like a de javu )."
1.0,who_killed_the_electric_car,another must see documentary. it's a no brainer but it's a good primer for conversation.
1.0,who_killed_the_electric_car,"Sad, considering where we could be today with the technology created 10-15 years ago; makes you wonder if GM would be a market leader today and not needing a government loan."

1.0,who_killed_the_electric_car,Electric Cars pre-date the Gas-Burning vehicles we know today. There is a good reason electric cars don't exist. I call it the subscription. There is a lot of money to be lost if we all discontinue our weekly subscription to gasoline.

1.0,pinocchio_1940,One of the great films from the era of Walt Disney himself!

1.0,1042582-aladdin,"One of the most exciting films there are. There's excitement, action, drama, and comedy. It's all very well done in here. It's #14 on my list. One of the well known films of the Renaissance era."

1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,"One of my favorite musicals ever. Jane Russell and Marilyn Monroe couldn't be better together. It's a shame that this was the only film they shared with each other. The musical numbers are fantastic, and the rest of the film is absolutely hilarious. Too much fun."
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,A great classic in my collectio
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,One of my absolute faves!!!
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,Cute movie! I live it! :-D
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,"Marilyn in the role that helped make Madonna a star many years later. Jane Russell holds her own playing the determined and ballsy best friend to Monroe's naive bubblehead. Seriously funny, but not entirely flattering for women in the modern age."
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,"One of my old favorite movies...Smells like childhood memory, looks fantasticaly elegant, two icons and music. Love it."
0.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,Doin' the python-and-goat. Money-obsessed Lorelei Lee and money-repulsed Dorothy Shaw avoid scandals aboard a pleasure cruise and in Paris.

0.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,"A 90-minute film with 40 minutes of sloppy song-and-dance does not an enjoyable film make. The only thing more appalling than the morals of this film was the acting, singing, and dancing. Boy, did I hate this."
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,"Kanske Marilyns bÃ¤sta film, dÃ¤r hennes charm glÃ¤nser rakt igenom. SÃ¤rskilt bredvid stela Jane Russell, som ofattbart nog var det stora namnet pÃ¥ den tiden som filmen gjordes. Hon fick mycket mer betalt fÃ¶r filmen Ã¤r Marilyn."

1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,DIAMONDSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSs
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,it is true gentlemen prefer blondes and this is one of the greatest comedy film in history of film making the cast supports the story through out the whole movie and the mood gets involved the 1950s did rock
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,"favourite scene- Marilyn trapped halfway thru porthole, then saved by child millionaire. genius! x"
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,This is a classic would strongly recommend.A very good feel good movie. But they new how to make films then
0.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,Certainly did not prefer the blonde in this one. Marilyn Monroe was annoying. I even prefered Jane Russell's version of Diamonds are a Girl's Bestfriend to hers.
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,One of her greatest films. She truly is a star on screen that has yet to be matched. A must see movie with some of the most memorable moments in her too short career. Love the movie and Marilyn even more.
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,"One of my all time favorite Marilyn movies. Great storyline, great actors and generally wonderful overall. The costumes are beautiful and it's a classic for many reasons. The music always make me smile and the ending leaves you smiling."
0.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,oldy is kinda embarassing by today's standards..women looking for rich husbands..does that ever change ? Nothing noteworthy unless you're a Monroe fan
0.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,That's why Monroe was a brunette. I guess she must have a Brazillen.
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,I do love me a good movie musical. This one fits the bill.
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,"Deserves five stars for the song ""Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend. Marilyln Monroe's performance was about 200 stars, the rest of the movie average at best."

0.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,This movie only serves to prove Marilyn Monroe was nothing special.
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,"Lorelei and Dorothy are 2 girls from Little Rock. Lorelei loves diamonds. Dorothy loves men. I won't reveal the plot (who has NOT seen this). But, it's a fun, wonderful musical comedy starring Marilyn Monroe and Jane Russell! I love this movie!"

1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,"GREAT!!! Full of laughs, and cinema magic..."
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,one of tha best marilyn movies EVER!!
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,It's a little hard to root for Marilyn to marry to the dorky rich guy but the rest of the film is so damn funny and pleasant to watch that it hardly matters. I sometimes forget what a great commedienne she was and this film proves it in spades.
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,UNTIL SHE WAS MURDERED MARILYN WAS A SUPERSTAR WHO WAS JUST STARTING TO COME INTO HER OWN.
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,Such a darling movie...just love it...especially Marilyn of course...

1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,I totally adore Monroe she was the perfect lady so stunning and coquettish.

1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,absolute classic ! Diamonds are a girls best friend!
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,"Lorelei Lee in that pink dress and those diamonds was my aesthetic model way back when. Her morality, however, is delightfully wayward and justified in a way which could only have held water in the 1950s. Terrific tunes too."
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,"Diamonds realy are a girls best friend! :) Wow, fab film!"
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,Bye Bye Baby = greatest song in the whole movie

1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,"Hilarious and outrageous examination of gender politics circa 1953. Monroe and Russell are an awesome comic duo. And it's a musical to boot. Hawks really could do it all, couldn't he?"
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,"""is there anyone here for love?"""
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,"A wondefull, witty comedy with Marilyn Monroe at her best. Also has some loaded undertones about gender roles and goldigging. Is it empowering? Degrading? On thing is sure, it's great fun."
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,Diamonds are a Girls Best Friend! What more can I say? I know the words and all the songs backwards I've watched it so many times. Marilyn at her pouty best and Jane Russell fabulously bolshy as her mate and chaperone.

1.0,f_for_fake,I'd say this is one of the great post-modernist films by one of the greatest masters of cinema.
1.0,f_for_fake,"In my mind, this is Orson Welles' true masterpiece. One of my favorite films of all time."
1.0,f_for_fake,"This is a brilliant Welles film with a strikingly modern attitude toward the truth and a form and style which perfectly expresses that attitude. Very Brechtian, sophisticated, globe-trotting and funny. Welles still had it even in the 1970s."
1.0,f_for_fake,"When the flush of a newborn sun fell first on Eden's green and gold,Our father Adam sat under the Tree and scratched with a stick in the mold;And the first rude sketch that the world had seen was joy to his mighty heart,Till the Devil whispered behind the leaves: ""It's pretty, but is it Art?"""
1.0,f_for_fake,One if not the best film I've ever seen a true masterpiece!!!
1.0,f_for_fake,"With this film, the last feature length film to ever have been completed by Orson Welles, he showed a never ending will to break new grounds and invent new cinema. F for Fake is a stand out essay documentary with great energy and life as well as a central gripping mystery."
1.0,f_for_fake,"While Citizen Kane may be a masterpiece, F for Fake might be Welles's most thought-provoking and wildly entertaining contribution to the art of film."
1.0,f_for_fake,Makes the films of most younger directors look stodgy and clotted.
1.0,f_for_fake,Orson Welles deconstructs art itself in this mind-blowing documentary.

0.0,f_for_fake,"Pretentious and ridiculous. Dated artsy fartsy, and I usually like artsy movies. Glad people like this couldn't get away with forging shit, with the technology to debunk them now. I'm astounded by all of the good reviews of this movie."

1.0,f_for_fake,"dunno how many times i've watched this, and i've always loved it, always found some new layer i hadn't thought about. all the talk about forgery (and the subsequent forgery of the forgery) is quite simply fascinating. a masterpiece in art theory."
1.0,f_for_fake,one of the most interesting and masterful documentaries i've ever seen ... even welles second masterpiece perhaps.
1.0,f_for_fake,"Masterful; Orson Welles' best film, period. This is pure genius."
1.0,f_for_fake,"It's incredible that Orson Welles was able to make something so completely unconventional so late in his creative career. But then, for all the crap that people say about Welles-- he was arrogant, he was brash, he was a drunk-- nobody ever says he couldn't make a movie."
1.0,f_for_fake,"One of the fastest, funniest, most entertaining documentaries out there from one of the great creative minds of the 20th Century."
1.0,f_for_fake,Greatest documentary I've ever seen !
1.0,f_for_fake,"Welles' free-form essay on fakery, art and authorship is fascinating, funny and beautiful. It's also complex and somewhat maddening. Not for those used to being spoon-fed stories and those who think they don't like documentaries should give it shot. One of the most interesting films of its kind."
1.0,f_for_fake,"Reality? It's the toothbrush...... waiting at home for you in its glass A bus ticket, a paycheck... and the grave."
1.0,f_for_fake,The ultimate example of Orson Welles's theory of film and editing.
1.0,f_for_fake,"Orson Welles is without a doubt The Lord Of Fun. Crafty how he out-fakes the fakes, and fakes us out. And embedded within the fun, a moment or two of sombre reflection worthy of any poet. A good reason to keep loving film."
1.0,f_for_fake,"I am becoming increasingly obsessed with the enigmatic Clifford Irving and, because of of this film, Elmyr de Hory as well. F for Fake is a brilliant construction of film making that explores many aspects of authenticity, forgery, and trickery. Plus, Elmyr is my new hero.. hey art world, suck it!"
1.0,f_for_fake,Trippy but briliant.
1.0,f_for_fake,You could be forgiven for not thinking that this is one of the greatest films of all time. Just don't expect me to be the forgiving one.
1.0,f_for_fake,"If you don't see this film, you can't say that you love movies."
1.0,f_for_fake,"An entertaining and disjointed story of a legendary art forger, his biographer responsible for manufacturing a psychotic Howard Hughs, and Oja Kodar, all used as an elaborate set up for Welles to fuck with your head. This movie is awesome."
1.0,f_for_fake,"So much in an hour and a half that is to be absorbed and enjoyed at the same time, a work of genius on the part of the great Orson, even if he likes the fish sticks better raw!"
1.0,f_for_fake,"A documentary film about fakers, where fact and fiction blend seamlessly into one hour and thirty-five minutes of greatness. Truly shows the power of the medium. But know this, Don't always trust what you're told..."
1.0,f_for_fake,"Not sure if Orson Welles was a genius? Watch this. Probably the best piece of film editing I've seen with an intriguing premise to boot.Welles presence is undeniable, as is his creativity."
1.0,f_for_fake,Orson Wells is hilarious and having fun for 95 minutes.
1.0,f_for_fake,"I can't quite describe this film, except for the fact that it's like nothing I've ever seen. The way Welles presents the material is so astounding and original. The editing and voice over narration really takes center and helps present the material in an entertaining and interesting manner."

1.0,f_for_fake,I loved it... more than Citizen Kane. Sorry for the blasphemy.
1.0,f_for_fake,"The OTHER Man in Black asks us ""What is truth?"""
1.0,f_for_fake,EVERYTHING. IS. AWESOME.
1.0,f_for_fake,What is art? Can forged pieces be high art? Anybody who has seen this virtuous landmark movie will never forget his monologue to the pictures of Chartres.
1.0,f_for_fake,"The final Welles masterpiece, a film about reality masquerading as a documentary on fakes. A master magician at the top of his game, a confidence trick to give confidence to anyone who SEES."
1.0,f_for_fake,The most intelligently edited movie ever. Welles advanced cinema again with this doc/essay; too bad nobody was watching.
1.0,f_for_fake,"It's impossible not to have a welles in such a list. This one is not as famous as Kane, but is as brilliant. Arf, there is also the lady from Shangai... It's too difficult."
1.0,f_for_fake,"QuizÃ¡s el mejor largometraje de Welles, desbancando incluso a ""Ciudadano Kane"" bajo mi gusto."
1.0,f_for_fake,"Had this received a wider distribution upon its release, I'm sure it would have sparked a revolution in filmmaking on the scale of Citizen Kane. There's an overwhelming brilliance flowing through this movie, and I can only hope that it will one day be appreciated as the masterpiece it is!!"
1.0,f_for_fake,"Welles was a genius. And not just a genius in the way the word often gets thrown around. A real genius-genius. This feels to me like his most Welles-ian post-Citizen Kane film--and, as his last feature, it's every bit as great as his first. Dizzying and delightful and magical (and fraudulent)."
1.0,f_for_fake,best documentary ever. orson welles is a god. edited to perfection. definitely a favorite
1.0,f_for_fake,"At the start of the film, a woman interrupts Welles' sleight of hand: ""Are you up to your old tricks again?""""Of course,"" he replies. ""I am a charlatan, after all.""What follows is an endlessly digressive cinematic monologue about truth, art, and shameless lying.They're all the same thing, after all."
1.0,f_for_fake,Fantastic. Orson Welles has created a masterfully edited/directed experimental 'documentary' which is so enjoyable to watch it's hard to put into words. Everyone should watch this. EVERYONE.
1.0,f_for_fake,"I recommend watching a pirated copy of this film. Even if you have a legit DVD, burn it and watch that copy. It only enhances the experience. [I didn't really do this, but that was my first thought after watching this film]"
1.0,f_for_fake,The most playful movie Welles ever made.
1.0,f_for_fake,"Welles is a genius, a clever, arrogant, devious genius. I love this film/documentary/biography - whatever it is."
1.0,f_for_fake,"A monumental achievement. Unfortunately ""Kane's"" shadow keeps a lot of Welles other work from getting the credit it deserves, but thank God for the Criterion Collection for making this film available again."
1.0,f_for_fake,"""Orson Welles = Citizen Kane"" to the majority of people but F for Fake keeps it real."
1.0,f_for_fake,"One of the best edited films I've ever seen. Welles' personality intoxicates you into the narrative, which, despite the theme of fakery, you cannot help but think it is true...."
1.0,f_for_fake,"Totally effortless. Welles is just fucking around with cinema, & still makes one of the more amazing things I've seen."
1.0,f_for_fake,"Endlessly fascinating and wonderful film, Orson is consistently compelling as our guide through a world of fakers, and in the editing we see him turn ordinary archive footage into a dramatic and humourous story."
1.0,f_for_fake,"Amazingly strange, avant-garde movie. Sort of a documentary, sort of about illusions, sort of about fakers, by fakers. Extremely unique."
1.0,f_for_fake,"Orson Welles' final film that he completed, and it's a great one. Part documentary, part film, part essay, it provides as much of an insight into Welles as it does the subject of fakery. A must-see for any Welles fan."
1.0,f_for_fake,"QUOTES: Because the fakes are as good as the real ones, and there's a market, and there's a demand. If you didn't have an art market, then fakers could not exist."
1.0,f_for_fake,"This movie is incredible. Once again, Orson is light years beyond the rest of us mere mortals."
1.0,f_for_fake,orson welles blows your baby mind.
1.0,f_for_fake,A fake film about a fake artist who had a book written about him by the holder of the fake Howard Hughes will. Or is it simply a documentary about a couple of forgers? Where does forgery begin and art take over? The irony is that the film itself is a wonderful work of art that is quite unique.
1.0,f_for_fake,"A wonderful look at the art of deception and why we shouldn't alway's believe the""experts"". The tone is both whimsical and tragic. And should you believe anything I've written? Well?"
1.0,f_for_fake,I could've sworn I'd already given out some hyberole laced rant about how awesome this movie is already.
1.0,f_for_fake,"Welles unbound. There is no other film quite like this. Funny, irreverant, profound and immensely entertaining."
1.0,f_for_fake,One of the premiere discussions of art and authorship. A joy to watch.
1.0,f_for_fake,Orson Welles the magician makes a documentary about hoaxes and fakery. Sheer joy!
1.0,f_for_fake,"A master class in editing, and other film slieghts-of-hand"
1.0,f_for_fake,"Outstandingly weird movie from Orson Welles. Probably his best, no shit."
1.0,f_for_fake,The best documentary! It's the only documentary film I've seen that one can call a work of art - it's the only one that even comes close to crossing the boundary from journalism.
1.0,f_for_fake,I love this movie. Perhaps my favorite movie that's not funny. Orson Welles meets documentary - kind of.
1.0,f_for_fake,Brrrrrrrrrrrriliant!!!!!!!
1.0,f_for_fake,"The most brilliantly structured and edited film I've ever seen. As soon as it's over, you'll want to watch it again. Virtuosity, charm and the avant garde; everything that great art should be."
1.0,f_for_fake,"To this day it is still the greatest documentary I have ever seen, and Orson Welles' greatest work."
1.0,f_for_fake,"Welles, though certainly a wierd dude, is really great...I shudder to think where his film-making would have gone had he been involved with the digital revolution...Recommended!"
1.0,f_for_fake,wow. this little gem is my favorite later work from welles .
1.0,f_for_fake,Work as if you have no money. Love as if you have never been hurt. Quote Orson Welles like no one is watching even though they should be. What can I say I'm a charlatan? Wish facebook would allow me to give it 7 stars.
1.0,f_for_fake,"In this humorous film, Orson says, ""I began at the top and have been working my way down ever since. "" F for Fake is a masterpiece essay/documentary by the great Orson Welles. Watching it will force you to think more critically about the art and artists that surround us."
1.0,f_for_fake,"Amazing, unique, and way ahead of his time, Orson Welles employed styles and techniques that are almost commonplace in documentaries and other films of today."
1.0,f_for_fake,"In a word: different. In more words: imagine a very good postmodernist essay on ""experts"" and art, but filmed. With quick-cutting that predated MTV by a decade+"
1.0,f_for_fake,"It's pretty, but is it art?"
1.0,f_for_fake,fantastic... he described film history in this documentary ... i can just say he is welles he could have done whatever he wanted
1.0,f_for_fake,"This is how cool Orson is: he doesn't have a lap at this point, and his girlfriend is the hottest person ever."
1.0,f_for_fake,Mostly likely his best flim
1.0,f_for_fake,"Orson Welles wouldn't dream of making a conventional documentary, he's probably not even capable of doing so. Instead this ""filmic essay on scams, forgeries and illusions is filled to the brim with the auteur's personality. A total mind-screw."
1.0,f_for_fake,One of my very favorites.
1.0,f_for_fake,"Welles' ""film essay"" poses interesting questions about art and authenticity, all the while playing with the medium to make us doubt its own authenticity. A great film."
1.0,f_for_fake,Loved this. Welles at his artsy fartsy best.
1.0,f_for_fake,"Years ahead of it's time, and vastly entertaining."
1.0,f_for_fake,"My favourite Orson Welles film. Decades before its time. All film critics should see this film before writing any sort of ""review."""
1.0,f_for_fake,"Orson Wells gives us a lecture about fakes and fakery, as well as indulging in some of it himself."
1.0,f_for_fake,"So much fun--Welles as an elderly, curmudgeonly Puck."
1.0,f_for_fake,One of the most brilliant films ever made.
1.0,f_for_fake,"Orson Welles is Jesus. The whole film is about reality and forgery. Is what he says the truth, or a lie? Watch it."
1.0,f_for_fake,"Awesome, odd but awesome, one of the most thoughtful movies I've ever seen regarding art, philosophy, truth and story telling."
1.0,f_for_fake,"F for Fake is prime example of how Orson Welles defies the limitations within any genre he works in. He bends genre conventions until they break. F for Fake is like an Elmyr Picasso,an entrancing and deceptive work of art."
1.0,f_for_fake,Truly great Orson Welles film made when Orson Welles movies weren't exactly in style.
1.0,f_for_fake,greatest movie of all time...magic
1.0,f_for_fake,"Not what you would expect to be the last finished film by Orson Welles, but still a great work. His monologue about Notre Dame probably is one of the top most beautiful moments of any film ever."
1.0,f_for_fake,Orson crafts an art that defies the boundaries of low-budget film making while leaving an impression of discomfort in reliance on modern facts.
1.0,f_for_fake,"a required viewing for anyone, anywhere... & what about the tiger?"
1.0,f_for_fake,A semi-fake movie about a fake-faker who inspired another fake. And this is just a general plot outline... The 9 minute trailer is a work of art in it's own right.
1.0,f_for_fake,There's a great section of movie where you forget when that hour of truth is up. Orson Welles' monologue about Notre Dame just... makes me cry.
1.0,f_for_fake,"Orson Welles brings a film that tests the limits of the medium, making the viewer question truth and fiction, as well as what lies in between."
1.0,f_for_fake,This movie really got me. Gotta love the ending. Orson Welles was a madman and a poet.
1.0,f_for_fake,My second favourite Welles film (after KANE)!
1.0,f_for_fake,"Gets me every time, silly Welles."
1.0,f_for_fake,What a brilliant fatass.
1.0,f_for_fake,"Just fantastic. All should be forced to watch at least once. Plus, DVD comes with the awsome doc ""One Man Band"""
1.0,f_for_fake,"Amazing. This film says so much about the power of editing and Welles's awesome wit. I love watching his films, because you can see a genuine fascination he has with conveying ideas and stories in fresh, unique and sometimes bizarre ways. I wish this kind of ingenuity existed today."
1.0,f_for_fake,Best mockumentary I've ever seen. Welles penchant for the dramatic and self-described charlottanism stand center stage as we try to see through the illusion to what he is really trying to say about fakers: perhaps Hollywood should take a closer look? It is after all an attack on them.
1.0,f_for_fake,An amazing film by Orson Welles. He makes fools of us all. A lot of interesting information...especially about Elmyr. It makes me question what is real and what is not. It's smart and captivating. Your eyes will be glued the whole way through wondering what will happen next!
1.0,f_for_fake,"Possibly the best documentary ever made, not only for the interesting subject matter but the construction of this work, which is next to sublime."
1.0,f_for_fake,"Hilarious. Masterfully edited. A fitting end to Orson's career. Contains the great line: The art world is a confidence trick. Smart and funny, very enjoyable movie watching. It's obvious that Orson had a good time with it too."
1.0,f_for_fake,There's nothing out there remotely like it. Welles was a pioneer till the day he died.
1.0,f_for_fake,"Perhaps the coolest documentary ever made, it seems almost inappropriate to call it a documentary."
1.0,f_for_fake,"Really interesting. It's one of those films you step away from and the more you think, the more layers you realize it has. The commentary and special features all add to what Welles was doing and what a perfectionist he was. But my favorite Welles has to be the Muppet Movie."
1.0,f_for_fake,By far my favorite documentary and Orson Welles film. It is in regards to fakery and the masters of the trade. Capturing how people have conned their way into wealth and prosperity.
1.0,f_for_fake,"Orson Welles best film, one of my top 10 films"
1.0,f_for_fake,"The best documentary I have ever seen. Interesting, informative and well narrated; Wells takes us a tour of the fakes of the world as told by one of the worlds great fakers: Orson Wells himself."
1.0,f_for_fake,"The most thought provoking, interest-holding documentary I have ever seen. Beyond unique."
1.0,f_for_fake,Welles still had it.
1.0,f_for_fake,Orson Welles is God. Seriously.
1.0,f_for_fake,"I am tempted to say that his heartfelt, complex, and brilliant meditation on art and lies is more relevant and entertaining than Welles' Citizen Kane."
1.0,f_for_fake,A documentary about the idea of reality itself. This movie just might change your life.
1.0,f_for_fake,One of the coolest documentaries i have ever seen. I love Orson Welles and highly encourage people to take some time and see this masterpiece.
1.0,f_for_fake,This film blurs the line between truth and lies and does it extremely convincingly

1.0,49_up,I definitely don't think this series was meant to be binge-watched. It's almost too much to wrap your mind around. It's crazy how many of the participants are upset about being on the series when it doesn't seem like it goes THAT deep to me. I still love it.
1.0,49_up,"And again they look back, this time with gratefulness and nostalgia. I like the fact that Michael was not just the interrogator here but he was actually part of it, observing with them and looking back about how he had been a part of their lives and how his project shaped them."

1.0,49_up,Greatest documentary series ever. 56 up coming out soon.
1.0,49_up,Great series though I wasn't one of the people that apparently grew up watching it every seven years. I came by it via a Roger Ebert review.
1.0,49_up,amazing. i can't wait for the next installment
1.0,49_up,Best in a long time. Loved it completely. Only problem with it is having to wait three years for the next one!!! Yikes!
1.0,49_up,it was soooo interesting!
1.0,49_up,"Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in sociology, psychology, cultural studies, or class/political issues. I have to admit, Apted comes off as a pretty pompous fellow in the Ebert interview... but Ebert's respect for the genius of this documentary idea kinda makes up for it."
1.0,49_up,"Glad to see things getting better for every one in terms of every one more 'comfortable in their own skins. One of the less depressing episodes, besides how they all aged immensely since 42, but the filled out features make them look more like their seven year old versions. '"
1.0,49_up,"I have now seen the whole series, to date. This is a fascinating look at the lives and feelings of real people, as they are revisited every seven years. Can't wait for the next one, but that won't be until 2013!"

1.0,49_up,I just can't explain how much I was affected by this film and the whole series of documentaries it belongs to. It's fascinating to see these people as young children and then look at their lives as adults. I'm especially glad Neil is in a better place in his life now. Wonderful.
1.0,49_up,This filmed over whelmed me like nothing I have seen. There is nothing that can replicate this. There is nothing that can match its impact.

1.0,49_up,Ever since my Dad put me onto this I've been hooked. I feel a bit dirty after watching... but so intrigued. It's like a really long wait for your favourite soap opera. I've heard that Apted has hung up the camera though on this one...
1.0,49_up,"If you watch one documentary in your life, watch this one, or any of its previous incarnations. Brilliant. Just thinking about the work that must have been done to make this series is staggering."

1.0,49_up,Can't wait 'till 56 up!
1.0,49_up,"The latest installment from Michael Apted's ""Up Series"". One of the best documentary series of all time."
1.0,49_up,The entire Up series is an astonishing accomplishment that literally ONLY gets better as time goes by.

Dave's love of music bursts out of the screen and sprays all over the audience... he will be getting a dry cleaning bill from me (I'm never going to get that smell out).
1.0,sound_city,Magic and Luck... Technology is the destroyer of truth... Art and Commerce are two... totally different things that rarely live in harmony... Bravo Dave... thank you...

1.0,sound_city,An amazing loud fun funny documentary. It was amazing and inspiring.
1.0,sound_city,"Great documentary on Sound City and the Neve console. I really enjoyed how the movie transformed into something much bigger, speaking to how human relationships are the core of making music. Awesome scenes of rock heros jamming together. Well worth the price and time to watch."
1.0,sound_city,Outstanding movie. I walked out of the theatre buzzing and wanting to talk about how great it was. Dave Grohl's man and is living the dream.

1.0,tangled,Great movie for kids and adults. Very funny. Felt kinda like older Disney movies with the singing and story content. I've seen this dozens of times with family and I still haven't got sick of it. That's a testament to how good it is.

1.0,tangled,possibly one of my fave disney films!
1.0,tangled,Beautiful music and endearing characters! I have no idea why Frozen gets more cred ?!
1.0,tangled,"My favorite Disney movie excluding Pixar. This was the type of movie that had me thinking about the repercussions of the final scene for days after my first watch. That's right. A 22 year old man on a high protein diet, somewhat emotionally upset from a Disney princess movie. Three thumbs up."
1.0,tangled,Very cute Disney movie! The chameleon and the horse are the best!
1.0,tangled,Genius and probably the most stunning 3-D cartoon ever made where Disney actually makes 3-D look as masterful as their 2-D animated movies. So awesome every time I watch it.
1.0,tangled,My favorite character was Flynn Rider he was a wanted thief and the Palace guards where chasing Flynn and his 2 side kicks now that was funny a long the way he meets Rapunzel.

0.0,tangled,The only characters I remember are the chamelian and the horse. That's not a good sign. The movie's ok. The voices are eh. Really kinda boring and pretty dumb. I'm sorry but the comedy doesn't hold up the film for me. This could have been much better.

1.0,tangled,The revolution of Disney Animation started here.
1.0,tangled,"Disney's 50th animated feature is tied to their other release, ""Toy Story 3,"" as 2010's best animated film. It's lovable, hilarious, and it's the best in a few categories. (A+)(Full review coming soon - with better wording)"
1.0,tangled,"Tangled should just be renamed ""Watch a This Instead of Frozen!"" While Frozen was a sloppy yet predictable movie, Tangled is a fun, silly, and beautiful movie. I really shouldn't have to say anything else. Just do yourself a favor and watch it."

0.0,tangled,Over use of anthropomorphized animals. Way too unrealistic. Plot just doesn't make sense. Does not show true human nature - too much of a kids' movie. Glorification of crime and injustice. A disgrace to democracy by glorifying monarchy.

1.0,the_umbrellas_of_cherbourg_1964,"Art direction and music makes it truly magical. My mum used to sing me ""I will wait for you"". It's not as happy as it looks and very moving - more moving than many films with no singing!"
1.0,the_umbrellas_of_cherbourg_1964,"Soaring, stirring musical drama. A conceit that should probably never have worked and does--beautifully. The only opera made directly for the screen of which I am aware."

1.0,the_umbrellas_of_cherbourg_1964,"undoubtedly the best movie of all time. Warning: it is bizarre because it's French and from the 60's, but that's what makes it great!"
1.0,the_umbrellas_of_cherbourg_1964,"Upon reflection, this is easily one of my favourite films. It's the quality of the performances, the bittersweet story, the fantastic set design, camerawork and long-take choreographed shots, the Michel Legrand music, and the everyday honesty of the lyrics."
1.0,the_umbrellas_of_cherbourg_1964,"The first French film I saw as a child. A visual masterpiece, a story which shatters your heart, and a fantastic music by Michel Legrand. Some of the most inspiring cinematography from the 1960s."
1.0,the_umbrellas_of_cherbourg_1964,"my french instructor showed this film in class, because apparently the singing slows everything down enough for us language-impared idiots to understand whats being said. I was enthralled, the rest of the class slept."

1.0,the_umbrellas_of_cherbourg_1964,"This film is possibly one of my favourites of all time, simply because it addresses a real life issue in a realistic fashion. There is no happy ending, and it's easy to relate to the characters, which are very well developed."

1.0,the_umbrellas_of_cherbourg_1964,"Another unconventional musical, another beautiful and brilliant film. Again, I can't recommend this movie highly enough. Exquisitely acted, sung, and directed, Michel Legrand's music really makes this featherweight tale of love into something profound and unforgettable."
1.0,the_umbrellas_of_cherbourg_1964,Jacques Demy's The Umbrellas of Cherbourg is probably the coolest movie musical I've ever seen. A charming film of incredible beauty that is both largely refreshing and somewhat sad in its message.
1.0,the_umbrellas_of_cherbourg_1964,So unconventional and beautiful. All the lines are sung in French with background music and the soundtrack is unforgettable. It is also painted so the colors are beautifully delicate.

1.0,filth_and_the_fury,Awesome look at what The Sex Pistols really were and what punk really is. Unlike The Swindle it is actually what the band is like. Best movie I've seen in a while!
1.0,filth_and_the_fury,"after the entertaing Malcolm PR bollocks of the swindle film - a very intelligent look at the psitols , is john lydon the most entertaining man ever?"
0.0,filth_and_the_fury,Factually inaccurate.
1.0,filth_and_the_fury,"Archival footage from newsreels, gigs & interviews. Rare photos. True to the timeline. Gives enough time to everyone in the band to know what they were about. Some funky animations. The best music documentary since The Decline of Western Civilization (1981)."
1.0,filth_and_the_fury,Educational look at life in England during the Sex Pistols rise and collapse. Lots of dirt being dug in all the right places

1.0,1009096-hairspray,who doesnt love HAIRSPRAY???
1.0,1009096-hairspray,"Another Waters' classic. This ""60s"" era romp is not only fun, but takes a poke at mainstream society and makes a commentary at racism in the process. One of the more accessible films from Waters, Ricki Lake is a great tracy turnblat, and Divine is simply divine as her mother Edna."

1.0,the_sapphires_2012,This is a sleeper hit this one. Beautifully directed. Definitely a must watch.
1.0,the_sapphires_2012,Vastly under-rated movie. Great soundtrack and groovy performances. A gem
1.0,the_sapphires_2012,"The comparison(s) to Bill Condon's Dreamgirls are inevitable. None the less, the story is strong and original. It tells a different story about how women people of color struggle on the opposite of the globe. The music and performances as actors work, too."
0.0,the_sapphires_2012,Good singing but rubbish acting and screenplay.

0.0,the_sapphires_2012,Not much of a comedy. I would rate this film NO STARS if I could. The only abut this movie that was worth the price of admission was the kick-a$$ music in the Weinstein Company logo at the start of the movie. This flick made Bullet To The Head look good. My grade: F

1.0,the_sapphires_2012,This movie is awesome! I loved everything about it. It far exceeded my expectations. The Motown sound was great. The girls had charisma. The Viet Nam footage was suspenseful. I'm surprised others are rating it low. Maybe the movie appeals more to those who were around during the Viet Nam war.
1.0,the_sapphires_2012,Even though it had great revues I didn't think it was going to be my type of flic. Was pleasantly surprised. Probably best film of year so far.

1.0,sing_street,"A beautiful and entertaining coming-of-age story set in the flamboyant 1980s, this movie strikes all the major and minor chords of life. Hopeful, fun-loving, feel-good, and ""happy-sad."" The only bad thing about this movie is that it had to end."
1.0,sing_street,"Truly amazing, charming, fast-pacing and with great original music, I can't think in a single thing wrong with ""Sing Street"", it ain't risky but who cares when it touchs your heart the way it does."
1.0,sing_street,"I loved this movie! It definitely didn't get the attention it deserved in 2016. It's got fun, eccentric characters who are really funny and the songs are just fantastic!"

1.0,sing_street,"A great rock n roll coming of age story! Dublin 1985If you love movies like ALMOST FAMOUS, THE COMMITMENTS and THE PERKS OF BEING A WALLFLOWER you'll love ?? SING STREET!Great New Wave/New Romantic Era Tunes + Great Originals!"

1.0,sing_street,"Starts with a slow half of the first act, but when the band gets together the film takes off. The Characters feel like normal people with some of the best chemistry you'll see in any film. Solid film that besides the language or the themes can be watched by anyone mature enough."

1.0,sing_street,"It's the prequel to the commitments with a story of hope and love weaved in. Warm, funny and very enjoyable"

1.0,sing_street,"John Carney is a brilliant writer, musician, director. I've seen two of his movies, so far, ""Begin Again"" and now ""Sing Street,"" and LOVED them. The fact that ""Sing Street"" is set in the 1980s AND in Dublin, Ireland makes it doubly wonderful."

0.0,sing_street,"This film made predictable, lame choices throughout that turned what could have been an excellent movie into a gross exercise in how to please a dumb crowd. Also the songwriting was largely cliché-filled and boring."
1.0,sing_street,Absolutely in love with this movie. My favorite from 2016 hands down.
1.0,sing_street,One of the best films of 2016.

1.0,sing_street,It's a feast for music lovers

1.0,sing_street,my favorite movie of the year. brilliant in every way.

1.0,sing_street,"Wow this is one of the greatest movies ever made, it is so Freaking good."
1.0,sing_street,Just a really irresistibly watchable movie. Never really stopped smiling or tapping my toes.
1.0,sing_street,"Watch this on Netflix right now! The music was great! The story was powerful and fun. The same people also did Once (another great movie, though might require VidAngel for some). We enjoyed it a bit more once we turned on the English subtitles as their Irish accents can be a bit strong at times."
1.0,sing_street,the movie itself is just 4/5 stars but the original songs written for this movie are exceptional and really put this movie over the top
1.0,sing_street,"kind of reminds me of ""the commitments"" and school of rock"
1.0,sing_street,As poignant as it's written and as heart-felt as it's performances I fell in love with this movie from the start of the first song. Maybe it's because I'm a sucker for coming of age stories but this one really touched me right in the feels.
1.0,sing_street,Terrific little Irish film set in the 80s. Perfectly captures the pain and joy of being 15. Highly recommended.
1.0,sing_street,This was a fantastic feel good movie. Lots of great music.
1.0,sing_street,"Great movie, and great songs. The young actors performed very well"
1.0,sing_street,Sing Street is filled with great music but also a touching story. John Carney keeps the film's focus tight and let's the young cast shine.
1.0,sing_street,De las mejores películas del año (por no decir LA MEJOR). Una banda sonora excelente. Una oda a los ochenta y la adolescencia en general.
1.0,sing_street,"Another brilliant movie from the director of ""once"" and ""behind again""! Great soundtrack and story!"
1.0,sing_street,"Love all of Carney's movies, and this one was a great one as well. If you liked Begin again and Once, then you will love this!"
1.0,sing_street,One of the best movies I've ever seen. Deep emotions and power of friendship.
1.0,sing_street,"My face hurts from smiling. Yes, this is a nostalgia trip for folks of a certain age, and the plot is well-trod territory. But it has limitless charm and heart, and is accompanied by a deliriously infectious soundtrack."
1.0,sing_street,I hate the fact that John Carney knows everything I want in a feel good musical. Because of this I have yet to be disappointed in his films.
1.0,sing_street,"A pretty awesome movie wich makes you feel good... it's awesome the way they can make you feel envolved with the characters, i think this movie deserves an especial mention to evocate the other people to see it"

1.0,sing_street,"Best film I've seen in a while. If you have any connection to the 80s or love stories about making art, you'll adore this."
1.0,sing_street,Simplemente el coming of age de nuestros tiempos sólo el tempo definirá si queda como un gran clásico.
0.0,sing_street,"I must be missing something with this: it's the law of decreasing returns as John Carney turns in another same but different tale of musical dreams, but none of it rang true."
1.0,sing_street,"A movie that inspires, awes and pleases all at once. Sing Street achieves with a very modest budget what many movies don't even hope to achieve."
1.0,sing_street,Everything about Sing Street has that evocative tone that managed to tune through flawlessly.
1.0,sing_street,Saw it again and definitely held up.
1.0,sing_street,Not sure if it's my first Irish movie it's really good
0.0,sing_street,The worst film I've seen in a long time
1.0,sing_street,A wonderful little ode to the power of music and the wide-eyed silliness of youth. Definitely one of my favorite movies of 2016.
1.0,sing_street,"If you're going to follow-up sleeper hit and Broadway sensation ""Once"", you'd better be original, fun, dramatic ... romantic, and a lot nostalgic. This musical hits all the right notes and all the right moves. Happy sad ... but mostly happy."
1.0,sing_street,You'll never gonna go if you don't go now. AWESOME.
1.0,sing_street,"Great film... if you liked Once, you will like this one. Just with 80's music instead. Great original songs as well."

1.0,sing_street,"Great movie about the human condition, especially for teenagers. Great message."
1.0,sing_street,"Absolutely incredible, the music, the true to life story, the essence of fun loving Irish lads and 80's music. I'm more of an action movie guy, this movie shook my foundation, that's the best way I can explain it. Amazing film and Jack Reynor is a star in the making!"
1.0,sing_street,Brilliant movie. Thoroughly enjoyable. Glad BA recommended as their hidden gem.
1.0,sing_street,"My current favourite 2016 movie: can't get the songs out of my head. A real tribute to the British 80s, this movie is a must-watch!"

1.0,sing_street,I really needed this after a horrible 2016 summer movie season. Brilliant!
1.0,sing_street,The songs in this film would be hits today and would make the movie great even without its great story and seriously upbeat attitude towards family problems. Such a feel-good film.

1.0,sing_street,Sing Street was not only a great Irish movie......but they were a great Irish band.
1.0,sing_street,"One of my favorite movies of the past couple of years.

Brilliant cast, fantastic script, and amazing direction."
1.0,sing_street,"Amazing movie! The soundtrack was incredible, the actors actually were teenagers rather than baby faced 30 year olds, and it was funny and joy filled!"

1.0,some_like_it_hot,"This should be 100%. Probably the best comedy on film. Just perfect. Curtis is amazing as is Lemmon... but the Curtiss ""impression"" of Cary Grant ranks as one one of the greatest movie takes of all time. Priceless. Immortal. Genius.My all-time favourite."
1.0,some_like_it_hot,"I have seen ""Some Like It Hot"" several times but never on a big screen with great sound. So thanks to The Zonita in Ampthill for showing this absolute classic the way it should be seen. I don't need to add much more except it is still very, very funny and brilliantly acted by everyone. Wonderful!"
1.0,some_like_it_hot,"""Nobody's perfect,"" Joe Brown says at the end. This classic comedy, however, very much is. The camera never swooned harder for Monroe than it did here. Curtis and Lemmon are equally sublime. An inspired romp of knowing cynicism, quirky comedy, and tender romance. Wilder just does no wrong."

1.0,some_like_it_hot,"Unlike many of the recent mindless, witless and vulgar expositions that pose as comedies, this is a farce turned fantastic by Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond's script that is full of outright belly laughs and asides that leave few moments untouched with hilarity."
