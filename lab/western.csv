1.0,open_range,One of the best Westerns I've ever seen and the shootout in the end is the icing on the cake.
1.0,open_range,"Had to mine out this Gold.. Well written, directed, a tremendous performance of Kevin Costner ..."
1.0,open_range,Great script done well for most part.
1.0,open_range,A fine Western with plenty of heart and a fantastic final shootout. Annette Bening is a letdown as the love interest but that is my only qualm.
1.0,open_range,One of the most entertaining westerns ever!
0.0,open_range,"Overly long, derivative, lacking in plausibility. When is the last time you saw a ""cowboy"" firing two pistols at once- Roy Rogers?"
1.0,open_range,"I admit it's been a while since I've seen it, but I remember enjoying the hell out of it."
0.0,open_range,"140 minutes of tedious, sappy cliche'. Painful to watch."

1.0,open_range,"Terrific in every regard - scenery, scope, plot, acting, action. In the Top 5 best western ever for me. Duval is perfect."
1.0,open_range,"Robert Duvall and Keven Costner were awesome together, their performances made a very good movie even better."
1.0,open_range,Kevin Costner not only impresses me with his great acting but also his great direction. Open Range features great in depth character development and great acting by its leads (Kevin Costner and Robert Duvall) and greatly filmed gunfights. This is a must see for any fan of westerns.
1.0,open_range,"This literally rivals the best western's ever made. If you ever get the opportunity to see it, please do. You will not regret it!"
1.0,open_range,I thought it was fantastic.

0.0,open_range,one of the worst movies ive ever seen.O.M.G. the movie was so bad . it just went on and on i really could not wait to the movie end.
1.0,open_range,One of the best movies in a genre that has had few successes since the days of John Wayne. Kevin Costner CAN act...when playing a regular guy. Robert Duval is brilliant as always. This is my most watched DVD.
1.0,open_range,awesome just for the double barrel shot gun violentness
1.0,open_range,"Loved this film.worked really well despite its pretentions.A proper western of the old style,with modern technique"
0.0,open_range,One of the worst westerns ever made.
1.0,open_range,"Authentic update of the sweeping classic Hollywood western. Costner knows the genre and this one is essential if you enjoy classic westerns such as Red River or Wagon Master, wherein the violence is balanced well with human and social drama."
1.0,open_range,"May not be the oldest western, but could be the best!"
0.0,open_range,"Yes, the final shoot out is one of the best I've ever seen in a western movie... but the story leading up to (and afterward) it is painfully mediocre."

1.0,open_range,"Mr. Costner gets it! This is a great western with a great script. You can easily get lost in the panorama, the dialogue and the story. Robert Duval proves again that he is the master of the western character. This movie ranks with the best."
1.0,open_range,Brilliant western starring and directed by Kevin Costner.
1.0,open_range,"one of the most realistic westerns I'v seen, the good guys aen't invincible and the gun soud affects aren't weird."
1.0,open_range,This was onf of the Best Westerns of 2004 I think Kevin Constar did a great job.

1.0,open_range,greatest western of all time
1.0,open_range,The best western since Eastwood days! Awesome preformance by Robert Duvall!
0.0,open_range,Costner is THE worst actor working today. His emotional range is comparable to that of a cardboard box. Mr Costner: Stick with directing.

1.0,open_range,One of my favorite Westerns.
1.0,open_range,"FANTASTIC! Best Western I've ever seen. Robert Duvall is a Badass, and Costner show that he can direct! The duo had acting down to a perfection! Loved it, wish I had seen it sooner."
1.0,open_range,"It's about time someone stepped up and made a good western. In my opinion Robert Duvall is the best unsung actor going. He's not on the magazine covers like some, or all over the media shows like others, but he acts circles around them all!"
1.0,open_range,Open range is a brilliant epic western. Thumbs way way up!!
1.0,open_range,"Good plot. I loved the interaction between chatacters, and dialogue. Some of it was stereotypical or cliche but it still was beautiful. I wish Hollywood would push more westerns."

0.0,open_range,Ce n'est pas si simple de faire un western.
1.0,open_range,"Without a doubt the best of the modern-day westerns, ""Open Range"" sets itself apart with terrific performances, an engaging story, and one of the greatest gunfights ever put on screen! Grade: A+"
1.0,open_range,Costner is in his element here. He doesn't miss on westerns and this is no exception. GREAT film. Duvall should have been nominated and the love story doesn't ruin the rest of the film. Don't miss it!!!

1.0,open_range,Again Robert Duvall pulled off a GREEEEART movie(western) Its a must have!!!!
1.0,open_range,Liked it alot but Robert Duvall is always awesome..
1.0,open_range,One of my favorites. Each actor fits their role perfectly. Great cinematography!
1.0,open_range,"Great depiction of how hard life must have been back then - be a man and stand up for yourself or turn the other cheek and always be under some bully's control. ""Some men are going to get killed here today - and I'm gonna do the killing""."
0.0,open_range,"Awful. Completely underwritten, fluffy, & tries way too hard. The only good thing about this movie is Duvall's performance."
1.0,open_range,best western in a while.

1.0,open_range,costner's right at home in the old west. this is an awesome western. right up there with the Wayne/Ford flicks i grew up on.

1.0,open_range,"Very interesting art direction, especially photography"
1.0,open_range,"A story with great characters! It's about simple things... like friends, respect, care, love... Simple words that are really little things to somebody, but a lot to somebody else... a movie that really touches my heart."
1.0,open_range,The best Western in decades.
1.0,open_range,Lots of my fave actors
0.0,open_range,"Decent shots, but in its hard-on attempt to recapture the sweeping cinematography that John Ford so delicately created in his Westerns of old, this movie falls so short of producing anything else that I've tried twice, but just couldn't finish it."

1.0,open_range,"A nearly perfect movie, and an excellent western. The craft on display in this film is a thing to marvel at. The story hits in lots of places--enough romance to keep my wife interested and enough conflict to keep me interested. The final gunfight is something. Duvall is in great form here."
0.0,open_range,"1 scene..just 1 good scene in the whole movie..and is a bloody one.. nice bloody one, but thats it..just that the rest is a boring flick"

1.0,open_range,Has probably one of the best shoot scene in western history!!!

1.0,open_range,The best western to come out since Unforgiven.
1.0,open_range,"Annette Benning, Robert Duvall, and Kevin Costner are good in this... great love story. it was very...outspoken and mature or something"
1.0,open_range,"Duvall delivers yet another great performance. Costner... well... Costner did a much better job directing this movie than he did acting in it. The scenery is breath-taking, though, and the gunfight at the end is one of the best I've ever seen."
1.0,open_range,A masterpiece revival western. AN outstanding acting performance form Robert Duvall and Annette Bening !
1.0,open_range,"My favorite western. It has a realistic storyline, realistic characters, and stays true to what would really happen."

1.0,open_range,This was one of the best movies in awhile

1.0,open_range,Not since Silverado and Dances with Wolves has Costner put out a better movie. He is born for the western genre.
1.0,open_range,"one of my all time favorites. duvall and coster are great and so is annette benning in a supporting role. the themes of redemption, justice, and love are evident throughout. the cinemetography is outstanding, the storyline is great, and the final shootout is one of the best ever filmed."
1.0,open_range,best movie ever(to me anyway)
1.0,open_range,"Robert Duvall and Kevin Costner star in this classic western about a group of free grazers who pass by the area of some corrupt sheriff and his lawman, and the trouble begins!!! They are forced to go to war against these trouble makers hiding behind a badge. Top 10 western movie and top 25 movie!"
1.0,open_range,This is the greatest western made so far this century.
1.0,open_range,brill i loved eveything about this film
1.0,open_range,They say that 3:10 to Yuma is the best western since the Unforgiven and they'd be right if wasn't for this film that's just as good. Simple men who love the quiet of the open range and crave no more. You work you get what you deserve.
1.0,open_range,"One of the best shoot out scenes ever! I usually don't like Costner, but he played a great character and had good chemistry with Bening."
1.0,open_range,"Any western with a tough old Bastard named Blue Bonnet, is tops in my books!"
1.0,open_range,"really enjoyed this film. It was an easy film to watch, the shoot out at the end was brilliant"
1.0,open_range,It's been said a thousand times....yes it's the best shootout probably in western movie history. It's also an engaging drama that stands high above most of the westerns made in the last decade.
1.0,open_range,"When I saw the previews, I thought oh good, a quiet western, then BANG. It kicked ass ever since."
1.0,open_range,I love this movie...Robert Duvall IS westerns! The scene with Costner and Duvall eating the chocolates before the shootout is so great. A really great movie.

1.0,open_range,Thank you AMC without which I would have never seen this great movie. But no thank you for the 50 showings of Top Gun...
1.0,open_range,This movie redeems Kevin Costner of all previous sins. Beautifully shot with a KILLER shootout at the end.
1.0,open_range,Kevin Costner's best movie
1.0,open_range,Great movie! Robert Duvall had some great lines. Kevin Costner also was a great character and did a good job at directing. The shoot out scene in my opinion was realistic looking instead of looking so staged.
1.0,open_range,"One of the best westerns I've seen in years. I just got it for a deal on DVD and had to buy it. It not only shows a love for the western, but the west as well with some wonderful picturesque shots. The shootout at the end was really fantastic."

1.0,open_range,My opinion - the best western (besides Tombstone) ever made!
1.0,open_range,this is a great film
1.0,open_range,One of my favorite movies. This story of ranchers vs. cowboys is more realistic and darker than most cowboy movies. On the level with Unforgiven and 3:10 to Yuma.
1.0,open_range,Great movie all around. ubet
1.0,open_range,"a beautiful, classic western....one of the best..."
1.0,open_range,"Beautiful film to watch and has arguably the most dramatic, raw American gunfight in cinema history. It's worth watching for the end!"

1.0,open_range,absolutely a great western movie.
1.0,open_range,Perfectly paced with two cracking lead performances at it's centre. Builds beautifully to the pivotal shootout - which is also exquisitely staged. A fantastic Western. Good going Kev! Lol
1.0,open_range,"Another one of my favorite character studies. Kevin Costner plays a great cowboy and and is an outstanding writer and director. Robert Duval's perfomance is perfect, you reall believe that he is an old cowboy. He has such a warmth and a grandfatherly way about him. A great film all together."
1.0,open_range,great movie. Love westerns
1.0,open_range,"Another great western movie starring Kevin Costner and the great Rober Duvall. The scipt is A+. The acting is outstanding and the scenery is beautiful. This is awesome movie and like ""Dances"" is destined to be a clossic!"

0.0,open_range,A deplorable western with little upside.
1.0,open_range,One of the best movies ever made!!
1.0,open_range,One of the greatest westerns of all time in my humble opinion...just tells a story without trying to be too Hollywood...and it has the greatest gun fight in cinema history.

1.0,open_range,Stinkin' awesome. I love the slow buildup.

1.0,the_killer_inside_me,Marvelous acting by Casey Affleck
1.0,the_killer_inside_me,One of the best movies ever. I cannot understand these poor ratings. The violence has context. The acting and storyline were amazing. Had me intrigued the entire time
0.0,the_killer_inside_me,The brutal violence and soft-spoken protagonist are both so unlikeable that I spent the entirety of the near two-hour film disgustedly staring at the screen and wishing I could have done something to abort this project before the concept was created and the cast assembled.
0.0,the_killer_inside_me,"This was a horrid movie. The pathetic and disgusting story is nauseating. The women are portrayed as helpless, idiotic twits who have no desire to fight back but just want to be beaten and raped. I hated every minute."

1.0,the_killer_inside_me,An ultraviolent excursion into the mind of a killer. The killing is so remorseless in this one you will never forget it. Casey Affleck at his brutal best.
1.0,the_killer_inside_me,casey affleck plays the perfect psychopath while seeing jessica alba get into hardcore sex makes the movie even better. love watching this movie anytime.

1.0,1074022-lone_star,"You need to see this movie, especially now with the debate over immigration. Besides that it is part of John Sayles's history of America approach and does complexity instead of simplicity."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,A wonderful film showing how the issues of immigration and living on both sides of the border have been complex and bedeviling for generations.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"A whodunnit of a 40 year-old crime in a small Texas town is twisty, racially relevant and charged with energy and wit. Excellent."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"Love John Sayles, love Chris Cooper, love this movie. Just saw it again for the first time since it came out and it totally holds up. Nowadays, interlocking plotlines are commonplace, of course, but this was one of the first."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,I don't want to give anyone any information about this movie. Just watch and enjoy.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,A great TEXAS movie.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,Nobody captures real live in the U.S. like John Sayles
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"Not a Western per se, this is the film that got me interested in watching cowboy movies. John Sayles made the entire cast shine (by the way, they mention Laredo, Texas!)"
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"Love it. A slow, complex cowboy kind of movie."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,I enjoyed the gradual revelation of several complex small-town relationships (some obvious and some not) as the sheriff investigates the discovery of a long dead body in the desert.  The transitions in and out of flashback were amazing.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,This is one of my top 5 movies ever.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"One of the best films of the 90s. Comments on history and releveant sociopolitical issues, all the while telling a great story in an original way. Sayles is a very conscious fillmmaker, and that certainly comes through here. One of the best final shots of any film."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,One of the most fascinating movies I have ever seen. It is strange how the movie develops layers to it's story. The performances are subtle yet effective. This is a classic.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"Sayles does a brilliant job condensing history - both cultural and personal - into a 134-minute yarn, examining how the murder of a sheriff thirty years ago affects people who are tied together today, whether they care to be or not."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,One of my all-time favorites.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,Like reading a great novel. Incredibly rich and layered story.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,One of the best movies I've ever seen! I can't believe I waited so long to see this; for some reason I was intimidated by it. But now I feel I've missed out by not seeing it sooner than I did!
0.0,1074022-lone_star,I like Sayles. I didn't like this.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,John Sayles the best most underrated director in cinema for twenty years running. Lonestar his most widely recognised achievement. Perfect.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"Complex and thoughtful with action to boot, and a star-making performance from Chris Cooper."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,Beautifully understated film. First time I became aware of the amazing Chris Cooper.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"True to life portrayal of the politics of life and love along the Border. And, one of my fave films of all time. Which says a lot."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"The interweaving stories in this movie are beautifully done, and the performances are top-notch! The last line of the movie is particularly haunting and resonant, especially for anyone from Texas."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"This is from the ever decling faction of American Cinema that still remembers how to make films properly. A superb piece of story-telling with great performances all round. Yes, even from McConaughy."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"Underrated, beautiful, and a good mystery."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,This movie is one of my favorites. It explores the complicated issues that surround family and cultural relationships.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,Pretty much how I grew up.

1.0,1074022-lone_star,"Yet another great movie by John Sayles. Chris Cooper is such a great actor that it barely matters how good the rest of the cast are (and they are very good). The ending is just lovely. Again, another humane film."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"La obra maestra de John Sayles y quizas su consagracion ante los ojos de mucha gente, su fuerte sigue siendo como guionista pero en esta pelicula demuestra su habilidad para la puesta en escena, un rompecabezas impecablemente construido"

1.0,1074022-lone_star,One of those films that makes me think American cinema still has a chance.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,Easily one of the best films of the 1990's and perhaps John Sayles'greatest achievement.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"John Sayles passes sin down from father to son, and across many borders. Beautifully realized flashbacks haunt scenes in the present. Extra credit for a brief history of the Black Seminoles."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,Sayles' best. Takes local politics in a South Texas bordertown and turns it into a grand tale. Has a lot to say about illegal immigration and class differences in America - it's more relevant than ever.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"The great American novel as cinema, by the vastly underrated John Sayles..."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"All the other reviewers pretty much nail it. Just wanted to add another positive, enthusiastic encouragement for those who haven't seen it to go out and watch it. It's amazing."

1.0,1041911-unforgiven,Great directing and acting. Best western movie ever. Only flaw was the lighting. So much of the movie was dim and hard to see.
1.0,1041911-unforgiven,"Eastwood's career is probably the icing of the cake for Unforgiven's character arch in this riveting, western classic where the ""hero"" of the story -and real life role model- is not only an oppossite of it's definition, but also a walking, and very meaningful, metaphor."
1.0,1041911-unforgiven,Despite being decades after the golden era of Westerns Unforgiven is one of the very best
0.0,1041911-unforgiven,A bit too much dragging and too long for a story like this.

1.0,heavens_gate,the critics attacked it because they didn't like the political orientation of the film
1.0,heavens_gate,Le plus grand film de tous les temps !
1.0,heavens_gate,A really good movie. This is not a typical western. There are no cowboys and Indians running around and shooting at each other. This is more of a meditation on class warfare here in the USA. Watch this movie with an open mind.

1.0,heavens_gate,This is a masterpiece of unpresidented awesomeness. It's not Cimino or United Artists fault that the public couldn't handle the fifty complicated plots and nearly three and a half hour running time. This movie marked the end of the epic era

1.0,assassination_of_jesse_james_by_the_coward_robert_ford,"A tense, poignant, and enthralling character study, with an epilogue that recasts what has gone before not as a tale of betrayal but as a study of success and failure."

1.0,assassination_of_jesse_james_by_the_coward_robert_ford,"The most emotionally powerful western I've ever seen. The script is magnificent and the performances (notably Casey Affleck, masterful) are near-perfect. The character development of Robert Ford is one of the best I've ever seen. The cinematography should have won the Oscar over There Will Be Blood."

1.0,the_homesman,Hilary Swank will break your heart in this movie. Not an upbeat movie but so well done it will leave an impression with you long after its over. She steals this movie in very subtle ways and again reminds me when in a good role she can take over a film.

1.0,the_homesman,"Tommy Lee Jones has created one of the first westerns from a woman's perspective. It's decidedly not romanticized; in fact it's the reverse. Outstanding performances by Mr. Jones and Hillary Swank, who shines, make this a movie I cannot get out of my head."

1.0,rio_bravo,"The movie is a great classic in its genre. But could someone, please, fix the movie year: this movie was released in 1959 (definitely not 1998)."
1.0,rio_bravo,"If you only see one Western ever, you might want to make it this one. The actors are all superb and the story, while simple, is compelling. In so many ways this is the model for so many Westerns that came after it (together with films like High Noon)."
1.0,rio_bravo,The best Western from the classic times by far! My favorite John Wayne western of all time.
1.0,rio_bravo,It could be the best western ever made.

1.0,rio_bravo,"along with eldorado, the best Howard Hawk´s westerns ever"
1.0,rio_bravo,One of the best westerns of all time!
1.0,rio_bravo,classic hawks john wayne vehicle
1.0,rio_bravo,This is one of my favorite westerns. Not only John Wayne and Dean Martin star in it but so dose Angie Dickinson. Its very similar to El Dardo thoe. But I gusse it was just so amazing the first time the had to make it agine.
1.0,rio_bravo,the cowboy flick to end all cowboy flicks.dean martin is drunk. john wayne is a stand up guy. ricky nelson sings. chyea.
0.0,rio_bravo,"John Wayne should've realized that when you make a film in response to another movie that the movie you're making has to be better than the film you're responding to. Horribly acted, horribly directed, horribly written. 1 star! High Noon is a masterpiece!!!"
1.0,rio_bravo,love this movie it is my husband fav movie it also grew on me
1.0,rio_bravo,"Rio Bravo is probably one of the best Westerns ever made. Wayne is so cool,but its Dean Martin as the drunk who shines for me."
1.0,rio_bravo,i love this movie with guys like John Wayne and Ricky Nelson i also like Dean Martin in this one he plays a good drunk but thats not the only reason i like this movie.Its a really good movie with a great cast in it.
1.0,rio_bravo,"What a cast, a great story and the songs are memorable...one of my top 10"
1.0,rio_bravo,"The most watchable Western of all time. A great buddy movie, a great shoot-em up, a great character study. Howard Hawks puts together the greatest Western/action team of all time with Wayne, Martin, Nelson, Dickinson, and Brennan."
1.0,rio_bravo,John Wayne underplays his character and lets Dean Martin take over in an often overlooked roll. The cast of characters are steadfast western favorites with just enough levity and seriousness to make this a fantastic move beginning to end.
1.0,rio_bravo,the duke kickin but and letting some woman tell him what he feel's

1.0,rio_bravo,"Angie Dickenson was the only negative in this movie. She was stiff and uninteresting, then again, maybe I was jealous??? Also, I was watching this movie at the very moment Ricky Nelson's plane was crashing, resulting in his death. :-("

1.0,rio_bravo,Every potential US immigrant should be forced to watch this western and then quizzed afterward
1.0,rio_bravo,"This is John Wayne's finest movie that has the Duk,e in his best role: a sheriff. The story is greatly told and fits the age rather well. Not many other Western films come close to this one's calm but dangerous nature"
1.0,rio_bravo,"A great story, especially when you realize it really is Dude's story, one of redemption...also great script. The new DVD, plus extras is excellant. Inspiration for the original Assault on Precint 13...by Carpenter."

1.0,rio_bravo,Y 'a rien de mieux au monde. Promis.
1.0,rio_bravo,"It's actually a romantic film about the way men should be, or want to be, and how they are as represented by the 3 characters. Or is it just cowboy gun-fights. I dunno. Brilliant. Chills up the spine when the mexican band start playing."

1.0,rio_bravo,"""I guess we made him talk after all. """

1.0,rio_bravo,"I have seen Rio Bravo more often than any other film, and it never gets old. Hawks, Wayne and the rest are at the top of their game."
1.0,rio_bravo,"With the steely competence of his adventure films, and the usual upending of the same typical of his comedies, it might be Hawks' richest, most complete film. Certainly Wayne has never been better--and he's easily outdone by Martin and Dickinson."
1.0,rio_bravo,John Wanye and Dean Martin...Think thats says enough! I watched this with my grandad and is the total reason why I love it. [Apart from Wayne and Martin]

1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,An almost perfect picture!
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,"A perfect film. Without flaw. It's richly stylized and full of Ford's striking compositions. And like a lot of late Ford, it's a melancholy, pessimistic film. Progress isn't idealized and the Old-West isn't pictured as a bastion of libertarian freedom."

1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,This is the perfect western James Stewart has become a new favourite of mine and in the man who shot liberty valance he doesn't disappoint. It shows how eventually every man reaches his breaking point. Must see western.

1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,Pretty much the best Ford I've seen thus far. Stewart and Wayne play off each other perfectly and Lee Marvin was badass. It's probably not as great visually as Stagecoach. A fews scenes like like the class room and the campaigning ones were too drawn out but the rest easily outweighs them.

1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,Excellent movie. Pairing Hollywood heavyweights John Wayne and James Stewart was a masterstroke from legendary director John Ford.

1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,I've seen bits and pieces of it - however the ending shoots the main nagging doubt that the senator cannot shake.Excellent movie.
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,"This movie is truly an amazing story with complex characters and great action. What moved me most about this movie is the message about how one incident, one's reputation can shape a persons life and the path they travel. The creation of a legend who never really was."
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,So THAT'S where the whole John Wayne/pilgrim thing started. I have seen a ton of John Wayne movies and never heard him utter the word. Jimmy Stewart is one of the best actors of all time. Just absolutely flawless. Big John was a total bad-ass. Good good good.
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,Great mix of western themes and Wayne & Stewart are only better with age!
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,"John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart, Lee Marvin (Western). Which will prevail; the law or the law of the gun?"
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,one of john wayne's best
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,"Classic tale that explores some pretty interesting themes about the relationship between the law and violence, and the unreliability of what we learn as history."
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,"hey Pilgrim, this is one clasasic film that must be seen"
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,"Lee Marvin, James Stewart, Woody Strode, John Wayne, ETC."
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,"Le meilleure Ford, avec The searchers."
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,"Often overlooked, but it is the best Western ever."
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,"I think this might be the best American western ever. I have a new-found admiration for ""The Duke"" after seeing this (as well as ""The Searchers""). This movie is like a mirror for what one could call the American Mind."
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,John Wayne is the man
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,"one of John Ford's best, and one of the best westerns EVER. Jimmy Stewart, Lee Marvin, The Duke, and Lee Van Cleef - only could've been better if Clint Eastwood had been in it."
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,My favourite western not just for the action and violence but the engaging characters and humor - Highly Recomended to all!!!
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,The best John Ford film I've seen.
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,"One of the great westerns, only Clint did it better."
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,"""When the legend becomes fact, print the legend"" This, Stagecoach and Grapes of Wrath are my favorite John Ford movies."
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,"One of the few really great Westerns. Much more realistic and meaningful than the typical shoot-em-up Western of the 1950s. Great acting by Jimmy Stewart, John Wayne, Lee Marvin and a great cast of familiar faces from the 50s and 60s."
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,"Great western, great movie. cannot stress that enough. Highlight the acting talent of stewart and especially wayne."
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,"I'm not a huge fan of westerns, but this one really stood out in my eyes. I have a new respect for Wayne and Stewart."
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,El maestro John Ford. Uno de los 10 mejores films de todos los tiempos...
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,"A really amazing Western. It's shot in a rather different style than director John Ford normally uses, but it's just as good or better than any of his other movies that I've seen."
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,One of the greatest westerns of all time.
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,"fucking incredible. ""this time right between the eyes, dude""."
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,"If Shakespeare had written a Western, this would be it. A story of scope, nuance, drama and wisdom peopled with vivid characters beautifully portrayed. Watch carefully! Everything you need to know about how the world works is there."
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,One of the greatest westerns I have ever seen.
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,it is so grand they should make an opera of it
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,I'll tell you what got rid of Liberty Valance! It was the spectre of law and order rising from the gravy and mashed potatoes!!
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,All time favorite movie.
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,"One of the best acted Westerns I know, with wonderful turns from Wayne, Stewart, and Miles. Conventional wisdom is the movie is as much about the end of the Western as a genre as it is about the end of lawlessness in the West and the rise of modernity -- an interpretation that feels right to me."
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,TWO MOVIE GREATS IN THIS ONE. SOME WILL LIKE IT SOME WILL HATE IT. I REALLY LOVE IT.
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,"Jimmy Stewart, The Duke, a wonderfully foul Lee Marvin, John Ford directing, and much more come together in a classic Western"
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,"Early America, the way that later Americans want us to believe it was, where men shoot each other. There's a lot of ham and falsehood - but it entertains nicely. Another film where TRAINS figure as the bustling hero."
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,Jimmy Stuart is my hero! Long live the freedom of the presses and may the one-room cell with the lock busted be occupied only by officers of the law!
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,probably my favorite movie of all time
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,Even John Wayne is good in this one... But is totally upstaged by James Stewart. Love it!

1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,"De los mejores westerns en la historia del cine, con este filme Ford, mismo quien diera fuerza a este movimiento, da muerte al western de una forma extraordinaria, que solo John Ford podia hacer."
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,"One of my favorite movies. It's a nuanced look at how truth is often constructed out of our legends, and how fiction can sometimes be more true than truth. And it's entertaining!"
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,John Ford is as close to Homer as America gets. Compare with L.A. Confidential.
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,"My favourite Western of all time, Waynes best performance, filled with great characters, and just a great story, loved it as a kid, still do. ""Just a beer, a beer's not drinkin!"""

1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,one of my all time fav Duke movies
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,"John Wayne provides the perfect foil character for Jimmy Stewart's wide-eyed young lawyer. Another masterpiece for John Ford. Besides, in what other movie do you get to see Jimmy Stewart punch John Wayne in the face?"
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,Fantastic plot. The film puts two amazing leading men together and they couldn't be more like night and day. Excellent cinematography...just a great movie all around.
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,"Here's where the Duke says ""pilgrim"". Big Duke, Jimmy Stewart and ultimate badass Lee Marvin at their best."
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,One of the all-time greats. Incredible cast and incredible storyline. Simply captivating.
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,"John Ford, James Stewart AND John Wayne? Does it get any better?????"
1.0,man_who_shot_liberty_valance,"One of Duke's best. The Searchers is probably his best of the Western genre, but this runs a very close second."

1.0,1046060-high_noon,Love the last scene when he drops his marshal badge on the ground. A classic tale of how one man's courage defies an entire community's cowardice and disloyalty.
1.0,1046060-high_noon,Simplistic yet perfect.
1.0,1046060-high_noon,"Really well-developed, for a Western. Takes you through the isolating process of making a tough decision to do the right thing."
1.0,1046060-high_noon,Classic western starring Gary Cooper as determined marshal Will Kane.
1.0,1046060-high_noon,"""You risk your skin catching killers and the juries turn them loose so they can come back and shoot at you again. If you're honest you're poor your whole life and in the end you wind up dying all alone on some dirty street. For what? For nothing. For a tin star. """
1.0,1046060-high_noon,"Controversial as it may have been in it's day, there's no denying that this film is the quintessential Western. Gary Cooper's performance makes me feel for the man, and the ensemble that makes up the fearful townspeople only add to the film's luster."

1.0,1046060-high_noon,This is a truely a great film of courage and to stand up against evil.
1.0,1046060-high_noon,"the use of the clock in this movie was ingenius, each time the big hand gets closer to noon, the tension builds just that much. by the end you're on the edge of your seat! also one of the best shoot outs in any movie i've seen."
1.0,1046060-high_noon,The best American Western in my opinion.
1.0,1046060-high_noon,The first Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly movie I ever watched and what a movie. So simple and yet filled with symbolism and great acting. Well-shot and a story that only gets better as time goes by. A classic and easily one of my top 10!!
1.0,1046060-high_noon,Brilliant and groundbreaking in it's real time tension.
1.0,1046060-high_noon,MY DAD LOVED THIS ONE.
1.0,1046060-high_noon,brutal el protagonista sin duda es el tiempo que nos agobia de una manera avasalladora y Gary Cooper con una excelente actuación nos hace sentir todo el peso del paso del tiempo
1.0,1046060-high_noon,"Miehen taytyy tehda mita miehen taytyy tehda, kun muut eivat uskalla. Vai taytyyko, kas siina pulma. Upea lyhyt ja tihea tunnelmainen lankkari. Odotusta ilmassa, puolelta paivin tapahtuu..."
1.0,1046060-high_noon,"Les prÃ©tentions les plus simples et les plus humbles font souvent de trÃ¨s grands films grÃ¢ce Ã  leur universalitÃ©. En tout cas, ici c'est le cas."
1.0,1046060-high_noon,"Controversial as it may have been in it's day, there's no denying that this film is the quintessential Western. Gary Cooper's performance makes me feel for the man, and the ensemble that makes up the fearful townspeople only add to the film's luster."
1.0,1046060-high_noon,I have nothing to say that hasn't already been said about this masterpiece.
1.0,1046060-high_noon,Best Western ever made.
1.0,1046060-high_noon,"The retro western,where it all began and Leone got influenced.Gritty,dirty and romantic in a sensuous turn on.Cooper proves to be a macho,sensible character and Zinnemann's magnum opus is as untouched as when it was first projected.And the beat goes on..."
1.0,1046060-high_noon,One of the absolute must see westerns. Amazing how much character study and insight they packed into a story set in half a day.
1.0,1046060-high_noon,"i would recommend this movie to everyone it is a classic. Gary Cooper is perfect in his role Grace Kelly, one of the most attractive women holly wood has ever seen. just an overall great movie."
1.0,1046060-high_noon,"CLASSIC OWNS IT WAS GREAT ,OMG GRACE KELLY WAS BOOTIFUL ,GARY COOPER GOTTA LOVE HIM TO A MUST HAVE IF U COLLECT WESTERN MOOVIES OH AND THE MUSIC IS KEWL TOO LOL"
1.0,1046060-high_noon,One of the great westerns.Gary Cooper may have been wooden but he was perfect in this highly tense(and much aped)oater...that title song that recurs throughout...cowardly Lloyd Bridges...snarling Lee Van Cleef...Grace Kelly...pouting Kate Jurado.
1.0,1046060-high_noon,the best not enough stars to say what i want to.
1.0,1046060-high_noon,"The classic of classics. The lone man on the horse theme redefined for post war America. 'Oh to be torn twixed love and duty, supposin' I lose my fair haired beauty.'"
1.0,1046060-high_noon,"great western. dont expect stage wagon chases and ingens.. its class, pure class. Gary Cooper bosses it up, all by his damned self."
1.0,1046060-high_noon,"One of the best westerns of all time. Definitely my personal favorite. Great song, great story, great performances, and beautiful to look at. Simply brilliant. Ok, so Cooper is a little old for Kelly..."
1.0,1046060-high_noon,Great writing...biting storyline. The cuts to the clock inspired Francis Ford Coppola to use the same concept years later in the remake of the Untouchables (in the train station).
1.0,1046060-high_noon,"If you're going to do the whole hero thing, you might as well do it this well: ""it takes more than big, broad shoulders to make a man."" Unassailably classic."
1.0,1046060-high_noon,"Impactful western with a moral point to be made: stand up for what is right, even if you are alone. Thrilling use of realistic time, and solid acting make this one for the ages."
1.0,1046060-high_noon,High Noon is very good too
1.0,1046060-high_noon,Standing up for what's right.

1.0,1046060-high_noon,Great writing constantly ups the ante in this spectacular western.

1.0,1046060-high_noon,Very well done! Great camera work. Wonderful screenplay. It all led up to an amazing climax at the end. One of the greatest western films of all time.
1.0,1046060-high_noon,Jotkut taistelut on vain taisteltava. Vaikka sitten yksin.
1.0,1046060-high_noon,Il est fort ce Gary Cooper!
1.0,1046060-high_noon,"One of my all-time favorite movies. One man stands alone against evil in a town full of ""good"" people who are too afraid to stand up for themselves. Awesome cinematography, and even the song grows on you after a while."
1.0,1046060-high_noon,Similar themes as 3:10 to Yuma. Gary Cooper out-badasses everyone.
1.0,1046060-high_noon,"High Noon is a western that transcends genres, much like Arthur Miller's The Crucible, into a parable about standing up alone and staring evil in the face. The morality and integrity of Will Kane is something you won't ever see again, in film or in life."
1.0,1046060-high_noon,One of the greatest westerns of all time. A true classic.
1.0,1046060-high_noon,"One of the first of it's kind. Spectacular in so many ways. I haven't seen a Gary Cooper film before, but I would have to say I enjoyed watching him work his magic in this classic western that will not be forgotten!"
1.0,1046060-high_noon,"This is the best western genre film I've ever seen hands-down... and I've seen many (thanks Mom). The tension derrives not from the music, not from the action, but from the characters themselves."
1.0,1046060-high_noon,This one has a special place in my play list. Think I have seen it more times than any other film. I AM a geezer.....
1.0,1046060-high_noon,"Excellent film. Interesting note is that this film takes place in ""real time"". Gary Cooper has to decide whether to do his duty or protect his life"
1.0,1046060-high_noon,The most beautiful western i have seen. The story of the lone sheriff is one of the greatest archetypal characters in film to date. Gary Cooper in his best role.
1.0,1046060-high_noon,one of my favorite Westerns of all time.
1.0,1046060-high_noon,"I mean, what else can I say about this absolute Western Classic"
1.0,1046060-high_noon,A slow build up to spectacular finish. Brilliant acting and taunt direction make this film exceptional. The last twenty minutes were brilliant.
1.0,1046060-high_noon,One of the best films ever made.
1.0,1046060-high_noon,"Greatest American Western of all time, just barely besting Unforgiven. 85 minutes of the tightest filmmaking ever."
1.0,1046060-high_noon,"Standing your ground has one perk: Knowing you are doing the right thing. Even if those you do it for don't deserve it and even if you are actually wrong. Gary Cooper is like an oak tree. In my top 5 westerns of all time. Past, present and future."
1.0,1046060-high_noon,I love the concept behind this film. The idea that the movie follows the clock is pure genius.
1.0,1046060-high_noon,John Wayne's least favourite film.
1.0,1046060-high_noon,"A real classic western, brilliant."
1.0,1046060-high_noon,"Gary Cooper is amazing, the movie is so subtle it blows you away. Highly recommended!"
1.0,1046060-high_noon,"One of the best Cooper films out there. It's set in real time, which adds a whole new level to the film. A must see!!"
1.0,1046060-high_noon,"A great untraditional western, where the action is only in the climax of the movie, is more thriller than actioner, has morality subtexts, an allegory for blacklisting and where the good guy plays it smart (and dirty). All shot in electric black and white."
1.0,1046060-high_noon,"The ultimate western - superb acting, incredible tension - just brilliant!!!"
1.0,1046060-high_noon,I liked it and Grace Kelly makes any movie good but I gotta say the good the bad and the ugly is my favorite.
1.0,1046060-high_noon,I can't believe I liked it.
1.0,1046060-high_noon,A true old Western with Grace Kelly
1.0,1046060-high_noon,One of the best westerns ever!
1.0,1046060-high_noon,"this film has it all .. but most of all, honour, courage and love .. to do the right thing when all around you show little or no support .. this is my all time favourite film"
1.0,1046060-high_noon,AMAZING i thought westerns are boring but this one is so good. grace kelly is just beautiful and so very believable in this film
1.0,1046060-high_noon,"I always say that I don't really like the western genre, but I'm asking myself if this notion should be reconsidered, because there are really, really good ones: c'era una volta il west, whose german title is way better btw, the man who shot liberty valance... or high noon. what a great film!"
1.0,1046060-high_noon,Probably my all-time favorite western.
1.0,1046060-high_noon,We should all have our theme songs following us around town.
1.0,1046060-high_noon,fair weather friends....
1.0,1046060-high_noon,"Another classic western which remains archetypal and metaphorical. One of the first ""real-time"" stories with a performance by Gary Cooper that remains timeless. Perfect pacing and tempo with an ironic ending for the ages."
1.0,1046060-high_noon,An Amazing Western that puts chills in your body.
1.0,1046060-high_noon,One of the best Westerns ever!
1.0,1046060-high_noon,Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly -- very near perfect.
1.0,1046060-high_noon,The best Western I've ever seen.
1.0,1046060-high_noon,High Noon is the kind of genre film that transcends genre.
1.0,1046060-high_noon,Classic. Great Western

1.0,1046060-high_noon,"my late dads favourite, great taste! you know when you have been there."
1.0,1046060-high_noon,One of the few really meaningful movies ever produced. A powerful and thought-provoking look at facing problems and threats.
1.0,1046060-high_noon,only for hardcore western fans
1.0,1046060-high_noon,Classic western. A town marshall faces an old foe alone after the townspeople turn their back in his calls for help.Gary Cooper rules !
1.0,1046060-high_noon,"Excellent!!! I watch this movie twice a year. The more often I watch it, the more I love it. Bravo!!!"
1.0,1046060-high_noon,Quite possibly the best western ever made. And one of the best American films ever made. We could use a lot more Gary Cooper in the world and a lot less John Wayne.
1.0,1046060-high_noon,Gary Cooper at his best
1.0,1046060-high_noon,"A wonderfully intense action thriller; the red scare parallels are underplayed enough that the narrative stands on its own, and the use of real time gives the story remarkable momentum."
1.0,1046060-high_noon,"because it plays out in ""real time"", it builds the suspense. very easy to get into."
1.0,1046060-high_noon,The benchmark for the classic western.
1.0,1046060-high_noon,"Builds tension perfectly. Raises the question, where will your friends be when you need them?"
1.0,1046060-high_noon,i can watch this over and over.

1.0,tears_of_the_black_tiger,"What a fantastic film. Its a western melodrama with b-movie violence and absolutely gorgeous production design. The film also has musical elements, midgets, etc. This film is just pure cinematic bliss. Beautifully artistic but at the same time doesnt take itself too seriously."
1.0,tears_of_the_black_tiger,"Love this one. It's a clint eastwood spaghetti western, butch and sundance, the wild bunch and pulp fiction well blended not stirred."

1.0,tears_of_the_black_tiger,"one of the funniest movies i've ever seen, yet it manages to have a truely sad ending. awesome movie."
1.0,tears_of_the_black_tiger,This is a stunning film. A bizzare homage to American TV westerns from the fifties filmed in glorious over the top pastel technicolour but with scenes of bloody mass carnage and a tragic lovestory at its heart. Asian cinema at its best.
1.0,tears_of_the_black_tiger,"A classic for years to come, So glad i stumbled on this one in the movie store, Everything was over exaggerated and blown out of proportion and it was so awesome because of that"
1.0,tears_of_the_black_tiger,"It's a Thai western in insane technicolor with bazookas, it's like a childs conception of an action movie except that it's amazing. The movie does go all Sirkian melo-drama partway through and feels like a colorful version of Once Upon a Time in the West. Definitly worth seeing."
1.0,tears_of_the_black_tiger,So beautiful and tacky. What great fun!
1.0,tears_of_the_black_tiger,"fantastic, wonderful, artful, bizarre and completely entertaing. You find that you're asking yourself constantly... are they serious? Are they really TRYING to act badly? SO FUNNY!"

1.0,tears_of_the_black_tiger,This movie is so good.
1.0,tears_of_the_black_tiger,Bright colours. Weird singing. Fantastic shooting.....plastic trees and harmonica. Not for the fainthearted - but if you truly like films a rewarding movie.
1.0,tears_of_the_black_tiger,Shockingly good. A sort of Thai reworking of Romeo & Juliet with cowboys. Brilliantly eccentric and beautifully over the top...
1.0,tears_of_the_black_tiger,"Visually its amazing, very bright colours and painted backgrounds. Its a bizzare mix of comedy, doomed romance and cowboy movie. Very entertaining and well made."

1.0,bone_tomahawk,A true gem in the rough that is amazon prime. The perfect blend of western and thriller with a dash of horror.
1.0,bone_tomahawk,Slow-burn story is right - but it is a crazy raging inferno by the end.
0.0,bone_tomahawk,"Possibly the worst, most disgusting, slow paced, rediculous movie I have ever seen. What were these people thinking who rated this positively? This movie is absolute garbage."
1.0,bone_tomahawk,Bone Tomahawk is a horror movie that actually gives us a satisfying pay off. You really root for these characters and it is a brutal film that pulls no punches. Will stick with you for days.

Christoph Waltz steals the screen everytime he's on it (and fortunately for us he's on there a lot). Foxx is phenomenal, Leo shows up as always. Samuel L Jackson is great comedic relief. Quentin did a great job here."
1.0,django_unchained_2012,"My favorite movie of all time. This movie surpassed my expectations in every way. Be warned there is definitely some heavy dialogue, but it is met with extreme violence and explosive action. A classic Tarantino film that will be remembered for decades to come."
1.0,django_unchained_2012,"Already excited to see it a second time, for I think it will grow on me even more. The usual staples from Tarantino; excellent dialogue, frequent subtle humor, over-the-top violence, and a stark look at real human wretchedness in history."

1.0,django_unchained_2012,"*****One of the best movies I've ever seen, Django Unchained gets everything right. It's got a great cast, a great script, brilliant performances; with Leo being the best, and that much appreciated Tarantino touch, that you just can't beat. Amazing."

1.0,django_unchained_2012,"Funny, well written, characters were brilliant. Why Leo didn't get an oscar for this only hollywood knows. Dramatic but comedic, Gorey but with soul. Language but given the time line, this film is on my list of all time great movies!"

1.0,django_unchained_2012,Tarantino rarely makes bad films but I'd say this is probably his best since Samuel L Jackson and John Travolta graced the set of Pulp Fiction. A great film. 12 Years a Slave meets Kill Bill! Christoph Waltz tops a great cast and a thrilling film!
1.0,django_unchained_2012,"Over the top, controversial, and hyper-stylized; Django injects a terrific storyline to use those usually weakness to their full advantages."

1.0,django_unchained_2012,"Boi this movie is so beast I watch it EVERY night. Jamie Foxx is undoubtedly the best choice for Django, although the script was written for Will Smith. Christoph Waltz does exceptionally well as Dr. King Schultz. Casting was phenomenal and the music was flawless."
1.0,django_unchained_2012,"Probably the best film I've seen. It captured my attention and the character's were played phenomenally. This is most likely one of Tarantino's obscure films and I enjoyed every moment of it. Christoph Waltz, you're my guy!"

1.0,django_unchained_2012,"Whilst a highly stylised look at the antebellum south could be seen as overlooking the atrocity of slavery, its brutality and heroic title character make this a perfect blend of realism and stylised aestheticization. Not to mention a superb ensemble performance with an oscar-winning script from QT."
1.0,django_unchained_2012,"Another Tarantino classic. In my top 4 with Inglourious Bastards, Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction. The cinematography is outstanding and the cast delivers with excellence. And of course, that Tarantino violence and gore doesn't come up short at all."

1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"Obra maestra de John Huston es una fabula sobre la codicia del ser humano y como la ambicion cambia a una persona , filmada en un maravilloso blanco y negro , con unos personajes memorables especiamente el de Walter Huston , de vision obligatoria"
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"If all you've seen of Humphrey Bogart is Casablanca, it's easy to overlook the fact that he was as well known for playing villains on the big screen as good guys. This film certainly qualifies as one of his villainous roles. An interesting character study and well worth the watch."
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,My favorite movie of all time. Hands down. A morality tale about the lust for gold and what greed does to the human soul.
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"This is one of my top 10 favorite movies. Walter Huston is born for his role and, damn, can he dance."

1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,My favorite John Huston movie? His adaptation of Joyce's The Dead is close.
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,A classic so ahead of its time. A deep and brilliant story that is as mythical as it is realistic. I feel it's Bogart's best acting performance ever and the movie feels so incredible real. This is one of the best classics of all time.
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"The arc of Bogart's character's movement into paranoia and madness is brilliant. I defy anyone to maintain their civility when there's so much gold at stake. It would take a very strong character, but as this movie basically says, be greedy and it will eventually catch up with you."

1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,This could be the greatest film of all time. It totally exposes the worst in the human experience and the irony is fabulous. Huston has outdone himself in this movie and Bogie should have won an academy award for this. Fred C. Dobbs is the quintessential Bogart character.
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"Great allegorical tale on human greed, with crazed work from Bogie and one of the great supporting actor turns by a grubby Walter Huston. And yeah, ""we don't need no stinking badges!"""

1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"A really good movie! I like idea of a sane person turning into a complete, Insane,Delusional and paranoid over greed. But... Shooting a guy over money is wrong. I thought it was sad to see a good friendship and partnership turn stale over gold."

1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,This was a fantastic movie and one that I would hate to see remade in modern Hollywood.

1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,I loved this movie. Great acting and a classic story that shows where greed can take a man. A fantastic cinematic adventure.
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,Badges? Just kidding. The combination of Huston's unfailing eye for directing along with Bogart's best performance makes for a piece of art to be reckoned with.
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"Whenever I think of how good people can become corrupted and distorted by money and power, The Treasure Of Sierra Madre comes to mind. The Godfather is this movie's only rival when it comes to the story of a honest man's descent into evil.Definitely worth seeing."
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,Not Bogart's best film (that'd be Casablanca) but probably his best performance. A lesson on greed and mistrust that has timeless resonance.
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,Bogart blew my mind. Watching his mind becoming corrupt over the idea of getting this money was a trip. I'm a big fan of movies about greed destroying men cause its so fascinating to watch. And this was one of the first to do it really well. John Huston is a hell of a director not just an actor.

1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,Bogart never ceases to amaze me. This is arguably his best performance.What a ballsy script for 1948... or at least violent. And possibly one of the few films of the era without some sort of romance in it.
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"Excellent, the mexicans in this movie are iconic. Bogart is a paranoid gold panner, absolutely one of the best films ever made"

1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,I revisited this film recently. It's still one of the great adventure stories but at the same a fascinating morality play on the corrupting nature of greed. Humphrey Bogart gives one of his career best performances in this one. His descent into madness in nothing short of superb.
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"We don't need no stinking badges! No, seriously, this film will rock your socks off. Keep an eye out for Walter Huston's crazyman dance and maniacal giggling, he completely outdoes himself and upstages Bogey."

1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,Humphrey Bogart's best film and a tale well worth telling. They just don't make 'em like they used to. This is probably the best movie that searches into the evolution of materialism and the downfall of the greedy.
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"Hard to classify adventure movie, one of Bogie's best performances. Great human drama that hits at the dark core of humanity in some chilling scenes. In its quiet way, the film builds slowly to a surprising and darkly ironic climax that is unforgettable."

1.0,tombstone,"I consider this one of the 10 ten Westerns of all time. I think the movie has everything you want in terms of a great plot, strong acting, and it is immersed in your consciousness by the mood created by the music, scenary, and lighting. Val Kilmer's work is Oscar worthy."

1.0,fistful_of_dollars,Clint Eastwood is one of the finest actors out there and he even more proves it in this great western.
1.0,fistful_of_dollars,A fistful of dollars is a film that I consider to be a work of art; Since the soundtrack is very good and stays in the head up to the photograph which is good; Not to mention the script that binds you in history; You will never know what will happen; You wait and be surprised; A great movie
0.0,fistful_of_dollars,"about as realistic as most Westerns, which is to say not realistic whatsoever, and as such tedious to watch. A waste of a few hours. Not one interesting or believable story line."

1.0,fistful_of_dollars,"If it wasn't for Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time in The West- This would easily be the greatest western ever made, the funny thing about that is, it was made by Italians not Americans. ""My maul don't like people laughing, you see, it's the crazy idea that your laughing at him."""
1.0,fistful_of_dollars,Sergio Leone transports 'Yojimbo' to the Spaghetti Western genre and in the process gives us a first glimpse of cinemas most iconic figures Clint Eastwood and the 'Man with no Name'. Morricone's soundtrack is colossal.

1.0,fistful_of_dollars,"The least of the trilogy: perhaps. A perfect movie: most definitely.

This is a perfect start to a perfect series."

1.0,fistful_of_dollars,"Love westerns. This is one of my favorites. Spaghetti westerns are a special breed, they're a hit or miss. Being the first, or one of the first, of it's kind, it is the king.

1.0,true_grit,One of my favorite John Wayne movies.
0.0,true_grit,"A cast of unlikable characters leaves you wondering how long this movie can go on. The script is weak, the lines feel over dramatic, very little real passion is felt in a movie about revenge. I don't get the hype, and I can see how a darker Coen Brothers reboot was due."
1.0,true_grit,"Liked the new one a lot, but it ain't the original."

1.0,true_grit,The 2010 version of True Grit can suck it John Wayne is the best ever!!!!!
1.0,true_grit,John Wayne as Rooster Cogburn may be the most likeable character of all time. Jeff Bridges and the Coen Brothers have some huge shoes to fill.

1.0,true_grit,Wayne deserved more Oscars than one in his lifetime.
1.0,true_grit,A real man´s movie. Well-deserved Oscar to the Duke.
1.0,true_grit,Also a great movie. Glenn Campbell did a good job in this movie. No one will ever be as great as John Wayne though.
1.0,true_grit,They did a very good job of following closely along with the book. Of course they glossed over a good deal too.
1.0,true_grit,"This is one of Wayn's most famous roles, and it's easy to see why. The character Rooster Cogburn seems to have been tailor made for the Duke. Glenn Campbell is a bit annoying, but he's not bad. There's plenty of gun play and laughs, and it is an enjoyable way to spend two hours."
1.0,true_grit,John Wayne has the best performance as Rooster Cogburn.
1.0,true_grit,John Wayne out did himself in this movie.
1.0,true_grit,No better scene in movie history than when Rooster faces the bad guys across the field.
1.0,true_grit,"John Wayne stars as Rooster Cogburn a drunk US Marshall who helps a woman track down the man that killed her father. A Texas Ranger (Glen Campbell) helps him in his quest to find him. This movie also stars Kim Darby, Robert Duvall, and Dennis Hopper. Good movie a must see for John Wayne fans."
0.0,true_grit,Absolutly dreadful.  Wayne DID NOT deserve the Oscar.
1.0,true_grit,You can't stop The Duke.
1.0,true_grit,"The best Western EVER...the dialogue is brilliant, and John Wayne's acting is XLNT (no wonder this was the movie for which he one his only Academy Award). P.S. The follow-up movie, Rooster Cogburn (w/Katherine Hepburn) is no slouch either!"
1.0,true_grit,John Wayne plays a tough guy better than any actor in history. Anything he is in is amazing and this is no different. One of my favorite westerns.
1.0,true_grit,wayne great what else is there to say
1.0,true_grit,"Why does the token Texan always have to die in the movie?...'cause we're willing to, damn it!"
1.0,true_grit,"The Duke, great movie."
1.0,true_grit,A good little romp and a string of wonderful performances. How Kim Darby didn't end up with a bigger career escapes me. Sometimes I wonder if the movie would be half as well remembered if John Wayne hadn't won an Oscar for it -- but I've convinced myself the answer is yes.
0.0,true_grit,john wayne sucks!!!!!
1.0,true_grit,it is a great movie and my personal favorite!! cant get any better!!!
1.0,true_grit,Outstanding movie John Wayne is my family favorite actor
1.0,true_grit,I have always loved this film. From the way you learn to love the errasible hero all the way to where you are willing him on as he charges the baddies with the riegns in his teeth. John wayne won an Oscar for this film for a reason
1.0,true_grit,John Wayne still good.
1.0,true_grit,they dont make movies like this anymore. My favorite 1!
1.0,true_grit,It doesn't get much better than this. One of the most bad-ass moments of ANY movie I have ever seen occurs at the climax of this flick. And some of the best trash talking you'll see in about any film from this era.
1.0,true_grit,A must watch movie. If you are going to be a man!!
1.0,true_grit,Tough old dog can still beat the daylights out of the oposition despite all odds. One of his best films.

1.0,true_grit,Another of the 3 greatest westerns ever made
1.0,true_grit,A gritty yet beautiful film. John Wayne for almost the first time does not play John Wayne. John Wayne shows why he is THE FILM COWBOY. John Wayne finally earned Best Actor.
1.0,true_grit,"The Duke at his best, Good and Evil square off"

0.0,american_outlaws,"An atrocious excuse for a western. This stinks on every level. Reeks of made-for-TV priduction style and lighting. Woefully directed. A waste of Colin Farrells talent. How 'professional' film makers can churn out this kind of film is beyond me. Avoid, avoid, avoid."

0.0,september_dawn,This movie does not deserve a 1/2 star rating... Robert Cain should be embarrassed . It is so lackluster and inaccurate that even anti-Mormon's probably had a good laugh!
0.0,september_dawn,"WOAH! Talk about revisionist history. This film is utterly inaccurate, and takes more liberties than Bush's cronyism. While the cinematography was decent, the ""love"" story was painfully forced. The film lasts far too long, despite not even being 2 hours long."
0.0,september_dawn,This may be the worst movie I have ever seen.
0.0,september_dawn,"The tag line is what drew me in, this is a perfect example of ""Don't judge a book by its cover."" Awesome cover, absolutely awful movie. Longest and most boring plot in the history of movies, it appears that action looms around every corner, don't be fooled."
0.0,september_dawn,"Even if I didn't have a problem with the film depicting most Mormons as evil vicious killers (which I do), the film fails on every technical level. Some of the worst crying in filmmaking history as well. Forget this movie ever existed."

1.0,alamo,loved it sooooo much expecially becuz i have a relative who fought in this war
1.0,alamo,"Much better, and far more historic than the John Wayne version. This looks and feels like the period piece that it is. The final assault on the Alamo is one giant frenetic frenzy of battle. The meat of this movie is the drama leading up to the assault."

1.0,the_good_the_bad_and_the_ugly,"THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is essential viewing for cinephiles- it is perhaps the finest of the European-financed spaghetti Western films. It is funny, epic, thrilling and somehow poignant. It also has all that Italian flair you'd expect from a great Italian filmmaker like Sergio Leone."
1.0,the_good_the_bad_and_the_ugly,"One of the best movies I've ever seen. Love the action, the violence, the characters, the premise, the cinematography, and that score.

1.0,the_good_the_bad_and_the_ugly,This remains as one of the best movies I have seen especially in the category of Western genre. This creates a role model to what westerns should be made of. Modern day westerns simply cannot live up to the standard movies such as this has set.
1.0,the_good_the_bad_and_the_ugly,One of the most favorite movies
1.0,the_good_the_bad_and_the_ugly,The seminal spaghetti western and Sergio Leone's greatest work. 3 characters each subvert the notion of the heroic and seemingly good character at the heart of the classic western. The score is perhaps cinema's greatest and is rightly famous.

0.0,the_good_the_bad_and_the_ugly,"Loved the second in the Sergio Leone trilogy, but despite Eastwood's powerful presence, this film fails by never developing any of the characters except Eli Wallach's, and even then it's just the same thing over and over, watching him act annoying and evil."

1.0,the_good_the_bad_and_the_ugly,"My favorite western of all time! It's too bad that the genre is dying out in today's film industry, but nothing beats a true film set in the civil war, such as this one! Clint Eastwood is the true definition of the word ""cowboy""!"
1.0,the_good_the_bad_and_the_ugly,I am not worthy to review this film. Just watch it. Then watch it again. Fun fact: There's not a single female character in the movie! Well...one extra makes a passing appearance!
1.0,the_good_the_bad_and_the_ugly,"El mejor western tras los clasicos maestros, y en algunos aspectos, superior ya que funciona no solo por ser western, es una pelicula redonda aunque no existiera el genero.

0.0,the_dark_tower_2017,I blame Stephen King for this. He has enough power that he could of had end of script approval but instead he just cashed the cheques. So a movie based on a sweeping 7 book series was turned into a YA flick; at least we didn't have sparkling vampires.

1.0,the_dark_tower_2017,A fun compression of the books into a single movie. This is a very post apocalyptic / body snatchers kind of story mixed with some Good the Bad and the Ugly.

1.0,the_dark_tower_2017,"As a reader of the series, it's better than I expected, given the 90-minute run time. Some of the visuals will add some flesh to your memories of the books.

0.0,proposition,"I am very sorry NOT to agree with most of you. Slow movie, expected plot, mediocre scenes, nonsensical sometimes, I was utterly bored. Nick Cave should return to singing and quit movies. Even if there were good points I totally failed to notice them. I'd NEVER watch it again."

1.0,proposition,"Simply the best ""Western"" ever made in Australia, if a little bloody. Somehow it manages to capture the very essence of early Australia colonisation - the feeling of constant struggle and alienation which the settlers experienced in this strange, unEuropean land."

1.0,proposition,"This film is outstanding. Cave and Hillcoat have done a superb job of both script, direction and score. And Emily Watson, wonderful."
1.0,proposition,Not for the faint of heart - very violent - but Guy Pearce is sublime and anyone interested in understanding Australia should see it. Highly recommended.
1.0,proposition,This movie is visually amazing and has a compelling story to boot. The acting is also mentionable. Ray Winstone's character in this movie is probably one of the best characters in film I have ever seen. One of the most emotionally moving and gripping westerns out there. Awesome!

1.0,proposition,"This girl loves her films violent, dirty, and contemplative. A rare film that delivers on all levels."
1.0,proposition,An Australian Apocalypse Now. Ray Winstone deserved an oscar for his performance of a brutal lawman trying to civilize the country. The elements of the traditional western appear bizarre and surreal and like nothing you've ever seen before. Especially if you never saw Lawrence of Arabia.

1.0,proposition,"Top Aussie Gothic Western from Nick Cave & John Hilcoat. Bleak, very brutal and beautiful. That's the three Bs!"
1.0,proposition,So gritty you'll feel dirty for a couple hours afterward. Beautifully shot and directed. If you have a problem with frank violence don't see this. Superbly acted all around but special mention to John Hurt and Ray Winstone. One of the best westerns I've ever seen.
1.0,proposition,the greatest australian film i have ever seen.
1.0,proposition,"Definitely in the running for grittiest western ever made, the Proposition is a mixture of blood, dirt, sweat, flies, and more blood. A second viewing revealed to me how much is packed within each scene."

1.0,proposition,Guy Pearce is excellent. The aboriginees head getting blown off is hilarious!

1.0,proposition,"Travels in Nihilon.Along with No country for old men and There will be blood one of the darkest semi-mainstream movies ever produced.Guy Pearce is fantastic in this. Great, realistic characters, incredible shot."
1.0,proposition,As far as I'm concerned there is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie. The music is amazing. The acting is flawless. The cinematography is beautiful during the emotional scenes and looks like a snuff film during the action scenes. Freakin awesome.
1.0,proposition,"Visually stunning, nicely paced, with fantastic performances all around. The Proposition was difficult to watch because it was so effective in portraying the savageness of Australia during colonial times. An absolutely remarkable film, but not for those with a weak stomach."
1.0,proposition,Colonial dirt and dust in 19th century Australia.....the best film I've seen in the last 5 years.

1.0,mccabe_and_mrs_miller,"This is a western so full of style which can set it apart from all others. And I would like to say that for the matter, ""McCabe & Mrs. Miller"" remains a masterpiece for that very reason."
1.0,mccabe_and_mrs_miller,"No, it really doesn't get any better than this."
1.0,mccabe_and_mrs_miller,"McCabe & Mrs. Miller is easily, though arguably, one of Robert Altman's greatest pictures - an anti-western that gently echoes of romance, murder, and pioneering."
1.0,mccabe_and_mrs_miller,Sly and subversive screwball-dramedy-western that proves revisionist adventures can be just as thrilling as the classics.
1.0,mccabe_and_mrs_miller,I'm watching it now on TV and remember being thrilled by it when it was released thirty years ago. Warren Beatty and Julie Christie are magic and Leonard Cohen's songs will bring tears to your eyes.
1.0,mccabe_and_mrs_miller,"A droll look at that frontier mining town and enterprise behind a bordello. Beatty's best film, and a true Altman masterpiece. The printed-on snow doesn't work, though. Great cinematography."
1.0,mccabe_and_mrs_miller,"Roger Ebert sums it up perfectly: ""Robert Altman has made a dozen films that can be called great in one way or another, but one of them is perfect, and that one is 'McCabe & Mrs. Miller.'"""
1.0,mccabe_and_mrs_miller,"A poetic, engrossing tale of Darwinism accelerated by pioneer-era capitalism and firearms, as well as a fascinating insight on the industry of prostitution and the fostering of the American Dream. This movie is yumyumyumyum."
1.0,mccabe_and_mrs_miller,"One of the few Beatty films that I can stand, and, boy, can I stand it! Deadwood owes this film everything."
1.0,mccabe_and_mrs_miller,"Altman's best film (by far), with every aspect being first-rate--especially Warren Beatty. McCabe's overestimation of himself leaves him on thin ice with a large mining operation looking to buy him out the easy way or the hard way. Leonard Cohen songs are perfectly suited."
1.0,mccabe_and_mrs_miller,A cynical classic with superb performances from its stars!
1.0,mccabe_and_mrs_miller,"Roger Ebert called it perfect. It's not perfect, but it's damn good. Certainly the best movie about a whore house I've ever seen though."
1.0,mccabe_and_mrs_miller,"Great Leonard Cohen score, great cinematography, great performances in what remains the most interesting of westerns ever made."
1.0,mccabe_and_mrs_miller,I wish there were more great Robert Altman revisionist westerns with soundtracks by Leonard Cohen. Particularly ones starring Warren Beatty as the kind of brash 1970s antihero that makes me love that decade's cinema so much.
1.0,mccabe_and_mrs_miller,"One of my favorite films! The cinematography is beautiful, but it also deals with thought-provoking themes of the West. This is not, however, a typical Western as it takes place in the Pacific Northwest around 1900. Julie Christie (in an Oscar-nominated performance) also is excellent."
1.0,mccabe_and_mrs_miller,"My favorite western ever and by a big margin, and it has one of the greatest climaxes of all time."
1.0,mccabe_and_mrs_miller,This has blown me away. There is so much detail put into this film that it feels like twenty different movies could have been made. Beautiful is an understatement. See this.
1.0,mccabe_and_mrs_miller,"An incredibly authentic, well-acted (particularly from Christie) western that pays off in the final incredibly tense shoot-out. A truly unique experience."

1.0,mccabe_and_mrs_miller,"Fantastic. I'd like to see it again when I'm not sick and have a clearer head to absorb some of the deeper themes, but purely on a visceral level, I loved it. Looks like it's time to dig deeper into Altman's films."

1.0,mccabe_and_mrs_miller,Goddamn this is a great movie.

1.0,mccabe_and_mrs_miller,"This movie has poetry in its bones. If you put Godard and Antonioni in bed together, put a gun to their heads, and told them to fuck, you have ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller"". It's ""Breathless"" in the old west. It's Altman's best film."

1.0,mccabe_and_mrs_miller,"Amazing. Beautiful. Powerful. Brilliant. Has made me a solid Altman believer.

1.0,mccabe_and_mrs_miller,"Sensational anti-Western with an anti-hero whose anti-big business ideals trigger a chain of events that drives the story toward something of an anti-climax (by Hollywood standards), which is the only way this film could possibly have ended."
1.0,mccabe_and_mrs_miller,"A truly sad story, a masterpiece, poetry is usually given to describe this film, and thats a perfect way of how this film folds out to be a poetic type film about love and a place of residence. Great acting and Altman adds the touches, great great film."
1.0,mccabe_and_mrs_miller,"Sheer poetry. There are only two movies of such haunting, lyrical beauty - Cocteau's ""Beauty and the Beast"" and McCabe. Leonard Cohen's bleak songs are the perfect accompaniment to Vilmos Zsigmond's moody cinematography."

1.0,1059489-wild_bunch,"The principal subject of the movie is the end of the old Western and the last Cowboys. In 1969, it was a controversial movie for his stylized violence, with many scenes filmed in slow motion."
1.0,1059489-wild_bunch,One of the best Westernsever made. The shootout at the end was epic. Peckinpah = Genious.
1.0,1059489-wild_bunch,Great western which is similar to the type of western you would see today. Tough uncompromising SOBs killing other SOB. Brilliant.

1.0,1059489-wild_bunch,The only western I like.
1.0,1059489-wild_bunch,This is not just the greatest Western of all-time. Here is a brilliantly well-developed character study of a group of fascinating individuals. A masterwork by Sam Peckinpah.
1.0,1059489-wild_bunch,"Perhaps the greatest western of them all. Peckinpah at the height of his powers. Great, grizzled veteran actors with peppery and sage western dialogue, much of it culled from Sam's storehouse."

1.0,1059489-wild_bunch,Perhaps the best western of all time.
1.0,1059489-wild_bunch,Gritty style western with plenty of moments that should have you watching this a couple of more times before you can fully grasp how messed up this early gritty style western.

1.0,1059489-wild_bunch,Total anarchy! Brilliant.
1.0,1059489-wild_bunch,This is my favorite western and Peckinpah relates between the grittness and the fantasy of the westerns into one great film about men going through new changes in the old ways

1.0,1059489-wild_bunch,"This movie was incredibly violent for the time, and it is easily one of the best westerns ever made. Besides maybe Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia, this is Peckinpah's crowning achievement. The Cast of Holden, Borgnine, and Oates is my personal wet dream. God this movie owns."

1.0,1059489-wild_bunch,"Sam Peckinpah breaks through with this legendary powerhouse of a film, fuelled by some fabulous autumnal performances by Ryan, O'Brien, Johnson and particularly Holden. Sanchez is heart-breaking, Borgnine never better and Oates, well, why not?"

1.0,the_hateful_eight,"Quentin Tarantino delivers a somewhat characteristic film with The Hateful Eight; however, he adds a healthy injection of mystery not seen in his films since Reservoir Dogs.

1.0,the_hateful_eight,"I wish this movie got more recognition, it's release date was a bit unfair because of the hype Star Wars had on the community. This movie serves a great tale, and shows more of Tarantino's in-depth description of different characters."
1.0,the_hateful_eight,"Fun movie that is very violent but not without reason. It tells an interesting narrative that never lets you trust any character while also making you love some and hate others then reversing your feelings on some. It's visually stunning, at times. I definitely recommend."

1.0,the_hateful_eight,This is the best movie of the 21st century. Kevin James deserved an Oscar for best fupa.

0.0,down_in_the_valley,"Congratulations, Edward Norton, you disappointed me. I didn't think you could do it, and you did. I hated this movie more than I can even express.

1.0,once_upon_a_time_in_the_west,"Bronson replaces Eastwood and is the fucking balls. Morricone's soundtrack especially 'Man with Harmonica', the opening scene, that final showdown and a smoking hot Claudia Cardinale. Jason Robards offeres up good support and Henry Fonda is a right nasty cunt."

1.0,once_upon_a_time_in_the_west,Epic and operatic. This film moves beyond mere storytelling and into mythmaking.
1.0,once_upon_a_time_in_the_west,Leone gave Westerns a new look and a new energy and Once Upon a Time in the West is absolutely riveting from beginning to end. It's the most beautiful western I've seen in its execution and entertaining as all hell.
1.0,once_upon_a_time_in_the_west,Perfection. Pure cinematic perfection.

1.0,shanghai_noon,"We need goofball movies like this to keep us all honest. Wonderful cinematography, great costume design, comic acting was spot on. Not for folks who don't like slapstick. Great for those of us who love to see feet & fists beat out bullets."
1.0,shanghai_noon,"I prefer the sequel (it's better paced and more consistent), but this is comedy-adventure gold, and one of my favourite all-time Westerns. Anachronistic as hell, but the leads (and the horse) have enormous chemistry, and both the OTT visual and wry verbal gags hit more often than not."

1.0,blazing_saddles,My favorite comedy of all time!
1.0,blazing_saddles,"In hindsight, this was an effective blow to racism in America. In it humor is dealt at prejudices with the lethality of a club with a nail driven through it; disarming even the most reactionary of us all."
1.0,blazing_saddles,So good it never should (or could) be remade.

1.0,blazing_saddles,The best comedy of all time.
1.0,blazing_saddles,"Hilarious in tone and musical acted, Blazing Saddles defines the Western genre into great slap stick comedy."
1.0,blazing_saddles,The only film I know that tackles racism and gets away with it! A classic comedy from Mel Brooks and it still holds up!
1.0,blazing_saddles,"""Blazing Saddles"" is an amazingly hilarious comedy from Mel Brooks that has a truly terrific script that is jam-packed with jokes and an amazing cast, especially the late Gene Wilder. May he forever rest in peace. If you love comedies then you will love (and probably have already seen) this classic."
1.0,blazing_saddles,one of the best that can never be made again.
1.0,blazing_saddles,Still one of my favorite Mel Brooks movies.
1.0,blazing_saddles,A true legendary comedy that is not afraid to offend everyone at the same time. A+

1.0,blazing_saddles,Banzé no OesteBanzé no Oeste - 1974 - Gene Wilder
0.0,blazing_saddles,"Widely regarded by many accounts I hear to be the best Mel Brooks movie, I found it to be by far the worst. A really over the top(even for Brooks) forced together piece of mush. Its racist vibe definitely does not stand the test of time. Men in Tights remains the pinnacle of Brooks."
1.0,blazing_saddles,Another Mel Brooke's classic! Gene Wilder is by far my favorite part of this movie. The comedy is light and in-your-face at the same time. Wonderful.
1.0,blazing_saddles,"This film definitely could not be made now, but as a farce and a satire of the prevailing racial views of the time, it is a smash hit."

1.0,blazing_saddles,Incredible fourth wall breaking.

1.0,blazing_saddles,"""Badges? We don't need no stinkin' badges!"""

1.0,blazing_saddles,My favorite Western.
1.0,blazing_saddles,If not one the best wacko and creative slapstick comedies out there. Mel Brooks was ahead of his time in comedy and they just don't make them like this anymore. 5 stars for what it is and if u just need a good laugh this is the movie. Great Cast!

1.0,blazing_saddles,"Irreverently hilarious from beginning to end, Blazing Saddles is a perfect example of parody, satire, and general comedy films at their finest, a quintessential comedic landmark chock full of endlessly quotable lines, goofily memorable characters, and continual nods to a well respected audience."

1.0,blazing_saddles,"Brooks couldn't let a frame go by, it seems, without reaching for a gag; some miss, but some hit so perfectly that genres crumble and stereotypes turn inside-out.

1.0,blackthorn,Grandioso western de la vieja escuela facturado en España(increible pero cierto). Un sensacional Sam Shepard como un avejentado Butch Cassidy y un no menos genial Eduardo Noriega sazonan una historia con un cierto toque decadente.

1.0,johnny_guitar,"One of the best westerns ever, where the genre turns into tragedy and avoids its cliches. Unforgettable performances by Joan Croawford and Sterling Hayden, Nicholas Ray at his best and an astonishing work on photography by Harry Stradling, to support the weak Trucolor system."
