1.0,conversation,"Suspenseful, urgent and confounding. Filmed as masterfully as the Godfather and it's stylised direction has never dated, it's only unfortunate it doesn't get more recognition as a classic, which it is. From script to score it sets a solid benchmark for filmmaking that still stands.",

1.0,conversation,"The conversation is an absolute masterpiece, totally defying my expectations. This film nails the balance between avoiding movie conventions and delivering a piece that is engaging from start to finish. A great follow up to the godfather from coppola.",
1.0,conversation,"This would be your average thriller if not for the ending. The ending turns this normal thriller into a psychological thriller that makes you question if any of it was actually real. This is a great movie over shadowed by Francis Ford Coppola's other great works (The Godfather, Apocalypse Now)",

1.0,conversation,"is simple and thrilling, i really love it",
1.0,conversation,When you hear the name Francis Ford Coppola your mind usually flickers screen shots from The Godfather films & Apocalypse Now but the more subdued less recognizable The Conversation deserves to encompass those same mental spaces.,

1.0,conversation,One of my two favorites. A brilliant character study and a great thriller.,

1.0,conversation,Pretty damn flawless.,
1.0,conversation,"This is always in my top five, or maybe even three, favourite movies. That it didn't win Best Picture for 1974 is forgiven only by the fact that Coppola was up for _The Godfather II_ as well.",

1.0,conversation,"The best performance of Hackman's career and he wasn't even nominated haha. Harry Caul is one of my favorite characters in the history of film, brilliant writing by Coppola. The Conversation is a great character study mixed in with a thriller. I love that score by David Shire.",

1.0,1013139-maltese_falcon,Classic film noir that starts off fast and doesn't really let up. Wasn't particularly fond of Mary Astor as the femme fatale but hey what are you gonna do.,
1.0,1013139-maltese_falcon,I love this film. Old SF back in the day.,
1.0,1013139-maltese_falcon,Bogart shines in this excellent classic film noir. Plenty of plot twists and mystery abounds in what I would call one of the best of it's genre. Definately check it out if you are into noir at all.,

1.0,1013139-maltese_falcon,"Classic film noir with Humphrey Bogart in one of his signature roles as morally ambiguous, hard as nails Private Eye Sam Spade. The cast is amazing (many of whom would return in 1943's Casablanca) and the dialogue crackles with wit and cynicism. A high-point of the genre!",
1.0,1013139-maltese_falcon,If you like Film Noir you'll like this. Bogart is great as Sam Spade and Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet shine as well in character roles.,

1.0,1013139-maltese_falcon,My only complaint is Mary Astor as the femme fatale. Other than that this film is one of the best noirs ever. Bogart is the man like usual.,

1.0,1013139-maltese_falcon,"Bogie as Sam Spade? Damn! Watch this movie, if only to see Bogie light up for the umpteenth time! Seriously, one of my faves, a time-less classic with an all-star cast. Astor, Greenstreet and Lorre also get a nod.",

1.0,godfather_part_ii,So which one is better: Part 1 or Part 2?,
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"An extreme rarity, a follow up movie that is at least as good as its predecessor, if not better. A fabulous prequel and sequel in one that shows a more (and less) human side to the family. Again, not a wasted scene or even shot, brilliant.",

1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Amazing, but about .0000000000001 is how much better the first one then this one",
1.0,godfather_part_ii,my favorite godfather.,
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Great sequel that just adds on to the first ones greatness. De Niro was great and was very important to the story which I felt made the film more interesting. Everyone must see the Godfather 1 and 2 before they die.~ Average Movie Guy,

1.0,godfather_part_ii,Too good to describe. Just watch it!!! But watch part 1 first.,
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Better than the original. Robert Deniro and Al Pacino are both amazing in what probably shoud've been the last Godfather movie made.,

1.0,godfather_part_ii,"One of only 3 sequels I know of (the other two being ""Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Batman Returns"") That were actually BETTER than the original film. Absolutely excellent. May be a bit too slow-moving for viewers under 40.",
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"One of the greatest movies of all time, the sequel to 1972's The Godfather benefits from the incredibly talented cast, which includes superb performances from Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, and a denser, action-packed plot which fully justifies the 200-minute screen time.",
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Personally, it was better than it's predecessor. Pacino should have gone home with best actor. The Academy got it wrong that year. Too many scenes that will stick to you for the rest of your memory.",
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The benchmark for making sequels. If only they'd followed up sooner with Part III; it may have been a masterpiece.,

1.0,godfather_part_ii,Al Pacino's acting in the film is far more superior as the ruthless don than his outsider character from the first film.,
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Probably my most favorite movie. Godfather II is partly based on the unused material from the first book and partly is new story by Coppola and Puzo. Needless to say GDII movie surpasses both original movie and book.,

1.0,1005973-diva,This was a very compelling thriller and I loved every minute of it. I loved the subplots and the intrincate makeup of the whole story. The motorcycle chase and the opera singing was extraordinary. I am not a fan of opera but she made you want to listen to opera! What a voice!,
1.0,1005973-diva,My favourite Paris film ever - Paris in the 80s without being cleaned up by Jeunet. Music by way of Opera and cigarettes by way of Gitanes. Beautiful,

1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Bogart and Bacall; directed by Howard Hawks; Scripted by William Faulkner. What's not to like, right? Convoluted plot, that's what, but hey, you're having so much fun in the noir genre you don't even care. Seminal film noir classic.",
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Classic film noir - love it,
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Another darn good Bogart film. Not as good as the Maltese Falcon but still great.,

1.0,1002352-big_sleep,the dialogue is perfect and so is lauren bacall.,

1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Brilliant. Smart and funny dialogue and an excellent cast really help this detective story come to life. Just make sure you pay attention to what is going on.,
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Absolutely one of my favorites. Bogart and Bacall actually reshot one of the scenes a year later having been married in the interim. Some of the plot is so convoluted as to be incomprehensible. Somehow it all suits the noir underpinnings and carries me away. I love it and watch it time and again.,
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"a film noir masterpiece, Bogart and Bacall are electric. Wonderful, Wonderful dialouge one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen.",

1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"One of the greatest of all films noir. Bogart is brilliant. Bacall was never a great actress but no one can doubt the chemistry between the two leads.

1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"The acting, dialog, Hawks's rapid direction and the chemistry between Bogart and Bacall all add up to something greater than the sum of its parts. The plot is so twisty that even the filmmakers couldn't explain why one of the murder victims was killed. But that's part of the picture's charm.",
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,I love the way Lauren Bacall flares her nostrils. Great dialogue.,
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Crime noir meets Bogie. Chandler's hero in both the 1945 pre-release with the more linear storyline and the 1946 version with all the smoldering Bogart and Bacall footage. A landmark.,

1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Wow! It's as good as Raymond Chandler's book. That's because the screenplay is by another great American writer, William Faulkner.  Humphrey Bogart is cast perfectly as Philip Marlowe. The rest of the cast is great too.",

1.0,1017293-rebecca,Beautifully sinister and understated Hitchcock masterpiece about grief and obsession.,

1.0,goldfinger,either this or the new casino royale movie are the best james bond movies ever made,
1.0,goldfinger,"Beginning with the first pre-credit Bond mission, including the first gadget packed car and ending with yet another woman in a parachute; this is the Bond film that delivers everything. Nobody does it better and never more so than Goldfinger.",
1.0,goldfinger,"Definitely one of my only favorites in the Bond franchise that would match up to most fans' favorites (meaning not all my favorite Bond flicks are just Sean Connery movies).... But holy shit, Goldfinger rocks",
1.0,goldfinger,The Best one ever made followed closely behind by Casino Royale,
0.0,goldfinger,"This is another old Bond with a ridiculous plot (fly over Fort Knox spraying knock out gas and then break into it? lol), but I think this is more like a Bond film than the first two. Still, quite badly made and not really much fun.",
1.0,goldfinger,"This is perfection in Bond filmmaking. It doesn't get any better than this - the action, the plot, the girls and Bond himself make this one the best Bond outing in my opinion. So many things are right about this one, just go see it right now. It's ridiculous. I love it.",

1.0,goldfinger,"Of all the 22 official Bond movies, Goldfinger is the definitive benchmark for what a perfect Bond movie should be. Memorable villains, cool gadgets, beautiful women, and a perfectly characterized secret agent to deal with it all.",

1.0,1032980-diabolique,"Diabolique is one of the greatest silver screen thrillers of all time. The last 15 minutes are nail biting, leading up to the clever and ahead of its time ending. A classic in every sense of the word.",
0.0,1032980-diabolique,"Another ""classic"" ticked off. And apart from the film plodding along in no hurry, when the twist comes, if you examine the film from the start, it doesn't hold up at all. I'm not watching any more French films unless I see the names Jeunet or Besson. Grossly overrated.",
1.0,1032980-diabolique,Brilliant! I hope I won't offend a lot of people by saying that this is better than any Hitchcock movie I've seen except for Rope and Psycho.,

0.0,1032980-diabolique,"I don't want to say this movie is ridiculous. But in a way, it is. The acting is horrible. The story is totally unsuspenseful and unsatisfying - as is the ending. It had a few funny one-liners - but that's it! Bad movie!",
1.0,1032980-diabolique,"a great, great movie... a true masterpiece, and it's a shame that so few people know about it... it's suspensive, haunting and shocking... it lives by the effort of it's cast, the acting is just emersed... highly recommended to all fans of intelligent top notch filmmaking....",
1.0,1032980-diabolique,"So, twist endings can be good after all. H.G. Clouzot knew a thing or two about suspense and tension, I'll tell you that.",
1.0,1032980-diabolique,Really surprise me at the end!,
1.0,1032980-diabolique,I have to say I saw the ending coming but only because wonderful movies such as this have influenced so many films since. Clouzot seems to know what creeps us all out and uses that to full effect in this film. This is one for every thriller/horror fan's 'must-see' list.,

1.0,1032980-diabolique,"This had me pinned in my chair. A nerve-wrecking twisted thriller with an ending that doesn't disappoint. Loved it all the way and I don't even like thrillers that much but this is not just a genre movie, it's a timeless classic made in 1955.",
1.0,1032980-diabolique,"Very rarely does a film billed as ""suspenseful as Hitchcock"" live up to it's billing. This is the rare exception. Wonderfully done. Highly recommended.",

1.0,1032980-diabolique,"I actually gasped out loud at one point! Loved it. Obviously. And I'm totally hot for Vera Clouzot now. I want to live in a world where everyone thinks I'm delicate and, therefore, I get forced to take naps all day.",
1.0,1032980-diabolique,The last five minutes or so of this flick made me more horrified than anything I remember in a very long time. This is a perfet thriller that just keeps building and getting better with each passing scene. A true masterpiece.,

1.0,1032980-diabolique,"Wanna see a suspense tale for the ages? You need look no further than this classic tale of murder from Henri-Georges Cluzot, who briefly dethroned Alfred Hitchcock as Master of Suspense. The ending is jaw-dropping and unforgettable.",

1.0,1032980-diabolique,"There's no way around it: if you like Hitchcock, you need to see this movie.

1.0,1032980-diabolique,"Pitch-perfect suspense thriller that out Hitchcocks Hitch. It may be hard for a modern audience to appreciate older films, but Diabolique is a film everyone should see. It is justifiably a classic of the genre.",
1.0,1032980-diabolique,A classic French thriller with lots of unexpected twists and turns in the plot - Hitchcock and Polanski would have been so proud of this film if they had directed it. Hugely influential - especially on Hammer Studios' black and white thrillers of the 1960s. Les Diaboliques was remade in the 1990s.,
1.0,1032980-diabolique,"This is the movie Alfred Hitchcock wanted to make and couldn't. That's not really a great loss for film buffs. Henri-Georges Clouzot has crafted one of the greatest suspense thrillers of all time. It has everything that you would expect from a Hitchcock film, plus an intriguing ending.",
1.0,1032980-diabolique,amazing. i knew how it ended and yet it still surprised me,

1.0,1032980-diabolique,Creepy suspense. Impressive. Shot at only two locations.,
1.0,1032980-diabolique,(****): :up:  A masterpiece. A well-made mystery/thriller that other mystery films should look up to. One great ending in my opinion. One of the best films of the 1950s and one of the best of the 20th century. AKA [i]Les Diaboliques[/i].,
1.0,1032980-diabolique,The perfect thriller,
1.0,1032980-diabolique,"I haven't seen the new one but the old one has lots of great twists. The acting is just great and as with most old movies the plot drives the movie more than camera tricks, gore, editing, and the stuff that drives today's mainstream movies",
1.0,1032980-diabolique,Perfect suspense film. It has everything a noir movie requires.,

1.0,1032980-diabolique,"Suspense, twists, and thrills above and beyond anything produced in this era. You will be horrified, you will feel dread. Even Hitchcock tended to sweeten his films to keep the audience sedated, but Clouzot gives you raw suspense with no anaesthetic. You will indeed approve of the title by the end.",
1.0,1032980-diabolique,This movie tops my list of masterpieces of suspense mystery cinema up to today. The suspense is so thick and unbearable it drove me to the edge of my seat clenching my fists. The American remake is of course another exercise in futility.,

1.0,1032980-diabolique,Far better than any hitchcock movie. Movies seem better in French too.,
1.0,1032980-diabolique,"The greatest movie Hitchcock never made! HG Clouzot's ""Les Diaboliques"" is an intense, creepy horror-thriller that only gets better with age!

1.0,1032980-diabolique,"It's a great suspense film--it pulls you in and doesn't let go of your attention until the very end, and maybe not even then. Of course Simone Signoret is perfect (as she always is), but Vera Clouzot is her perfect foil. And Charles Vanel as the detective is perfect as the precursor to Columbo.",

1.0,1032980-diabolique,"Very scary, very creepy, even if you've already seen it. Hitchcock wanted to buy the rights to this novel to make the film, Clouzot beat him to it by one hour.

1.0,blue_velvet,"The unrivaled magnum opus of Lynch's filmography, ""Blue Velvet"" is disturbing and horrifying, and at the same time totally intriguing and engrossing. It pulls you in, and forces you to ask yourself about the darkest desires that you may have. Truly a masterpiece in a very storied filmography.",
1.0,blue_velvet,"A surreal and dark thriller, Blue Velvet shows just why David Lynch is so well regarded, delivering a film that is simply amazing.",
1.0,blue_velvet,"An original movie from David Lynch even maybe bizzarre, the pervert nether side of an ordinary life, which the society tries not to discern.",
1.0,blue_velvet,"Beautifully surreal and darkly funny. It's one of the rare films that I had the urge to make a quick U-turn and go back into the theater, plus all the right people hate it ; i.e. None of the people whose opinions I respect.",

1.0,blue_velvet,"surreal, weird, and dream-like blue velvet is odd in a way only David lynch can accomplish with his interesting story telling and strange symbolisms",
1.0,blue_velvet,Blue Velvet is a deceptively well intentioned film steeped in tons of Lynchian weirdness and eccentricity. The opening scene tells you everything you need to know- peel back the blue velvet for yourself and see what horrifying secrets lie beyond.,

1.0,blue_velvet,A twist masterpiece.,

1.0,blue_velvet,Blue Velvet is like a demented Alfred Hitchcock thriller. Dennis Hopper's performance is incredibly haunting and somewhat traumatizing.,
