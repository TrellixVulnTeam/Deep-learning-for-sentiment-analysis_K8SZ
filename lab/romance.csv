1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Timeless storytelling, incredible set direction and truly heartfelt performances. Even my son loved it and it's subtitled!"
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Magical, stunning. A fairy tale come to life."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Jean Cocteau is brilliant and I've loved this movie since I was little. I love the disembodied arms holding the candles that light themselves...
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,a stunning piece of work.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Les vieilles romances
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Stunning and beautiful beyond words. Amazing special effects that only further the story.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"One of Cocteau's - and cinema's - finest moments. Stunning, sumptuous sets and with a tragic tenderness at its heart."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"I remember we watched it at the cine-club when 6. It stayed in my mind as it was an enchanting fable. When I watched it again, many year's later, I understood why. Cocteau's visual style was so forward at the time. It is just an amazing film!"
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Fantastic French fairtale
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"if this is the version of Cocteau, then i give 5 stars"
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,The best looking movie ever? Any fan of Gustave Dor'e must see this.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Completely unique telling of the tale that is atmospheric, mesmorizing, and absorbing. Some outstanding make up and a hell of a production design."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Tremendous...mesmerising, yet unsettling, one of the great adaptations of folklore. Sophisticated, and almost modern for its time, leaves most fairytales-on-film looking 2-dimensional, distinctly last-century by comparison."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"special effects are supposed to enhance a story, not drive it, and for this reason, the basic special effects here from the 1940s obliterate most special effect movies that exist today."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,A great Cocteau film with some inspired photography and special effects. Magical.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Agonizingly beautiful and ethereal. Emotes strongly. Watch this and disregard the Disney trite.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"The, unfortunately, less seen adaptation of Beauty and the Beast. This French film is more imaginary than the original, the characters are better developed, and the Disney one didn't twist my emotions like this one did."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"i loved the movie! it's a beautiful film and if you were a fan of the disney remake, you have to see this version. this movie is slightly creepy and even funny at times!"
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Quite simply one of the best film adaptations of a fairytale ever made; full of beautiful, dream-like surreal imagery. Brilliantly well-realised and utterly enchanting throughout."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"""This is the movie that got me into French surrealism. I just think it's really pretty, and it's the sort of movie you never, ever see anymore these days."""
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Based on the old story of Beauty and the Beast. This is beautiful film with stunning imagery.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,this is such a beautiful film. it enhances a gorgeous story and without all the special effects that films seem to rely on today appears magical.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,The cinema's greatest fairy tale. A visual wonder.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,A beautiful film that becomes even more amazing when you realize that it was filmed at the end of the Second World War. The juxtaposition of fantasy and the reality of the war around it is truly amazing
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Wow, if you haven't seen it, see it. Disney owes much to this timeless classic. Jean Cocteau shows us seemless visuals of a beauty and standard that are few and far between these days. Simple, elegant, imaginative story telling for a absoulte master."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,This movie turned me into a Jean Cocteau and Henri Alekan fan. Visual magic and the story to go with it. It's hard to believe it was made over 60 years ago.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Enchanting like nobody's business.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Insane...watch it if only for the candle holding arms in the wall
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"i didn't like this too much at first, but it grew on me. now i must own it."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,I love this 1946 version of Beauty and the Beast more than the Disney version. The special effects done for that time period were amazing. One of my all time favorite movies.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Amazing. The simple techniques of reverse and slow motion make the film enchanting.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"I honestly love this film! The lanterns are something else! I wish I had an amazing castle like that! Turn off the subtitles though, that's the BEST way to watch! it's french duh! :D"
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Cocteau at his peak.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Haunting, mysterious, and dreamy. It has aged, but somehow maintains a strange power about it."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Wow...this is such a fantastic, beautiful telling of one of my favorite fairy tales. It's in French, but there are subtitles of course. And the special effects might be old-fashioned, but that makes it all the more magical instead of holding it back."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Cocteau maintains the psychology and mysterious fairy tale beauty of the original story, and throws his own ideas, inventions, and images into the mix. Pretty much the best movie ever."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"It's terrif. The acting is superb, and the special effects put today to shame. Especially when you consider they were getting all their stuff stolen, since it was right after the war."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,A great work of imagination.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"She cries diamonds, and this was made in the 1940s. No CGI, just pure movie magic."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Sheer magic. Cocteau shows why he is considered one of the great artists of the 20th century. His imagination and technical prowess in this film are unparalleled. 10/10
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,so beautiful! i watched the whole film on the french channel with no subtitles
0.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Wow. I went into this fully expecting to love it, since Beauty and the Beast is one of my favorite fairytales, but I find that I can't understand what all the hype is about. Maybe I expected too much?"
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,The best cinematic adaptation of this story and one that inspires again and again. Definitely a fantastic flick for preparing to watch Pan's Labyrinth or Legend.
0.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,I watched it and was a mix of bored and weirded out all the way through.
0.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Seen it but didn't really like it..
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,I saw this before and after I read the story in French and it still continues to amaze me. Cocteau is a poet and Marais perfectly captures his words.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Mesmerising. Its dreamlike atmosphere and beautiful mise en scene virtually lulled me into a trance. Unlike Cocteau's earlier surrealist ""Blood of a Poet"" (1930), this movie is surreal in aid of creating a fairytale atmosphere, to enhance a story."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"The most beautiful love story ever told indeed! It mesmerizes with every sparkle, tear, every glance from the beast!"
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"A really wonderful film. A lot better than I thought it would be. The story is beautiful, timeless, and classic. It's a masterpiece!"
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,so beautifully done.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,The original is always better.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"So dark, so beautiful, so magical, so French. A real conte de fées."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Find it, watch it, you'll be pleased."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"A wonderful adaptation of the story, all the strange bits of folklore are there, as well as the natural terror and disgust one would feel when first confronted by something which was neither human nor animal (something noticeably lacking in the America cartoon)."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"It's a visually beautiful film. Anyone who needs pointers on art direction should check this film out (as well as ""Kaidan"")."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"A masterpiece, very different from the Disney cartoon version. I like them both, but the Cocteau version is much, much better. The atmosphere is very magical and haunting, and Cocteau's effects are plain awesome. I prefer Orpheus, but this movie is also one of my favorites."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,One of the most beautiful movies ever made. This is no happy Disney film with singing and dancing; this is a dark fantasy that is engaging throughout and stunning in its design.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,This is the film Disney turned into a musical. I love it as much as I love disney's version.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Wow. La magia del cine está encarnada en el collar.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Magical! It's one of the most fascinating movies you will ever see!

1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,ahead of its time - beautiful! C'est Magnifique!
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Startling, aching beauty and incredible invention keep this a fairy tale on the edge."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Better than the Disney film, Cocteau knew how to make a great Fantasy film. Rather than rely on High Fantasy elements like the hero's quest, his use of surrealist and bizarre visual art preceded films by directors like Guillermo del Toro."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,must see brilliant cocteau film
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"One of the most beautiful things I have ever seen. The whole film feels like some beautiful dream, filled with perfume, music and magic."

1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,The definitive version. Forget that Disney carp.
0.0,knocked_up,Can Judd Apatow make a movie the doesn't reference celebrities every ten minutes? No. We get it Judd you're famous. And please stop putting your untalented family in your movies. Overall a dreadful film that never should have been made.

0.0,knocked_up,Knocked Up is entirely unfunny. It's as simple as that.
1.0,knocked_up,"There are very few movies that have you laughing out loud constantly, but also being filled with emotion and love for all the characters. Knocked Up does just that.10 out of 10 AMAZING"
1.0,knocked_up,"Judd Apatow and Seth Rogen came up with the most genius comedy of the 21st century. The story is original and fresh, the writing is great, and the acting is wonderful . A good blend of romance, comedy, and real life. A movie that is always enjoyable to watch."
1.0,knocked_up,this had me rolling from I came ooooo ooooo I came
1.0,knocked_up,So the film portrays men as laid back useless stoners with no concept on reality and women as uptight and worriers of what the future may hold but... Oh no wait that is actually how most males and females are.

1.0,knocked_up,"This was drop-dead hilarious!! It will keep you laughing the entire time!! It also showed that becoming a parent is a lot of work, but is worth it at the end!! The cast was awesome, especially Jonah Hill and Jason Segal!! They stole every scene they were in!! This is a must-see!!"

0.0,knocked_up,Not Funny. Cliche teen movie. Stupid plot. My opinion.

1.0,knocked_up,right up my alley. i was laughing the entire time. the exchanges between paul rudd and seth rogan had me in stitches.
1.0,knocked_up,"you look like Babe Ruth's gay brother,Gay Ruth"
0.0,knocked_up,This movie wasn't the greatest. I saw quite a bit of stuff I just didn't want to see.
1.0,knocked_up,"Remarkably both extremely funny and very sweet. The humor flows well from slapstick to witty, leaving a bit for everyone, and the story itself is actually poignant and timely. Judd Apatow has proven that he can be honest without being mean and that he can be funny without being bitter."
1.0,knocked_up,HOLY SHITT! AMAZING
1.0,knocked_up,Hilarious!! Loved it!
1.0,knocked_up,The best movie of the summer!
1.0,knocked_up,Awesomely Funny Movie!
1.0,knocked_up,This movie was so much funnier than I expected it to be. It is funny because of how true it is as a married person. It may be scary if you are not married right now.
1.0,knocked_up,Funniest movie I've ever seen.
1.0,knocked_up,"You look like Babe Ruths gay brother, Gabe Ruth"
1.0,knocked_up,always classic with apatow

1.0,knocked_up,"Probably favorite film if not definitely top five. I love Apatow and Rogen, they need to calibrate more again."
1.0,knocked_up,This has to be the funniest movie I have ever seen. Even the little things made me laugh.

1.0,knocked_up,best film I have ever seen
1.0,knocked_up,VERY GOOD MOVIE AND IT WAS FUNNY AS HELL...
1.0,knocked_up,"I thought it was down right hilarious....considering my sister went with me....even more funnier cus of our...issues...but dude, I would think that this should be in all birth teaching classes in High School to scare the crap out of the students."
1.0,knocked_up,"Possibly the best movie of the year, though I would rather say Hot Fuzz. However, I think I've found a new favorite comedian. Which is pretty much anyone associated with Freaks and Geeks, especially Jason Segel or Seth Rogen."
0.0,knocked_up,"Am I the only person who thinks this movie was just 2 hours of stupid crap? I gave it one star because it just reaffirms my decision to never have children.Moral of the story: When a friend tells you a movie is awesome and different, don't listen!"
0.0,knocked_up,"It certainly tries, but each attempt at humor is a failure to launch"
1.0,knocked_up,This movie is awesome Seth Rogan is the perfect role for this

1.0,knocked_up,Great movie except when I saw it there was a big yellow line running through the middle of the film.
1.0,knocked_up,this movie is so funny everyones got to see it i laughed hard
1.0,knocked_up,"One of the best movies ever! Pure class. Watching it as I type and it never gets old for me. Katherine Heigl is a legend, Seth Rogen is a legend. Excellent acting and I don't know what else to write except that it shouldn't only be Rogen on the front cover, haha."

1.0,1074022-lone_star,John Sayles scores again with this great contemporary western with a great cast performing in a modern story!
1.0,1074022-lone_star,one of my favorite films of all time
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"A beautifully crafted film that has just about everything. Murder, racism, inter-generational conflict and just a touch of incest.. Awesome stuff."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"Brilliant movie, great as a great novel."
0.0,1074022-lone_star,Gives up on exploring the murder mystery and decides to beat the viewer around the head for two hours with anti-racism stuff.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,A slow burner but this is maverick director John Sayle's at his best and is a near masterpiece.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,One of my new favorite movies. This is a total masterpiece and I really need to delve into Sayles' filmography to see what else I find.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,My all time favourite.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"One of the best movies ever made--and yes, that includes ones from whatever Golden Age you consider to be golden. Magnificent. John Sayles is a god."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,Beautiful movie. I just get lost in the story and once again a great romance at the center.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"A great movie! If you've ever wanted to gain insight into border town politics/culture, this movie nails it."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"Oh, that was really good."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"Complex and thoughtful with action to boot, and a star-making performance from Chris Cooper."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,brilliant--does John Sayles do any other kind?
1.0,1074022-lone_star,Spike Lee could learn a thing or two from America's greatest living independent filmmaker- restraint causti
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"Beautifully crafted. Each silken plot web is elegantly, yet mysteriously, woven into the others until, suddenly, all is revealed. A genuine work of art."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,I have no idea why this isn't on general release in the UK - it's a gem!
1.0,1074022-lone_star,Lone Star just may be the best movie ever made about Texas and its very complicated history.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,Multinarrative masterpiece that makes a lot of excellent points about racism. I loved it
0.0,1074022-lone_star,rubbish! interesting topic but crappy production and delivery. my man kris kristofferson can and has done a lot better!
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"A movie that springs out of real Central Texas theatre companies. Intricate plot, many surprise twists, and challenges to stereotypes. Set along the border between Texas and Mexico."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,One of my favorites.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,NO MONEY TO SEE IT!!!MO.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,One of the best murder mystery films out there! The Texas setting and pacing are just right. Chris Copper is superb as well as the rest of the cast. Not to be missed. Highly Recommended!
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"Sayle's best, and a masterpiece."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"'When your daddy died, they broke the mold.'  ""You ain't Sherriff Deeds, you just Sherriff Junior....""  ...... Bartender: 'Heck, I'm as liberal as the next guy, but.'.. Cooper: ""....as long as the next guy's a redneck."""
1.0,1074022-lone_star,Saw it with Eric Conner when it came out. It poured while we ran from the parking garage. Kris Kristofferson and Chris Cooper were great.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"I liked this a lot ! Good human story with some likable characters..Kristofferson's a fine heavy .Nice twists, satisfying ending...things get wrapped up, but not in a hokey way."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,One of my favorite moves
1.0,1074022-lone_star,Great movie - and what an important teaching tool!
1.0,1074022-lone_star,Enchevêtrement d'intrigues sous la chaleur torride du Texas. Vraiment bien écrit et filmé.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,My favorite movie of all time.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,An excelent film by John Sayles. It reflects on myths and their breaking. I highly recommend it despite its length.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,love this movie it brings the past & present together
1.0,1074022-lone_star,Love it. Films of interconnected stories are some of my favorite kinds of films.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,The best in a series of great Sayles pics. This one centers around a Texas border town spllintered as much by race and ethnicity as by secrets.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"Love it. Fantastic cast, supreme acting and intertwined stories."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"Like a calm, wistful, cool breeze on a mid-May afternoon. Top-of-game showings from Kristofferson and Cooper. Neato directing tricks that mesh beautifully with the story and the way it unfolds."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"Kanonfilm. Chris Cooper er jo som vanlig bra. Kris K er stor, og MM passer som kjekk oppkomling.Historia er bra, mange parallelle historier. Helt mulig Ã¥ se den kun som en mordmysterium, men den har mange lag som en helhetlig historie. Anbefales!"
1.0,1074022-lone_star,brilliant--does John Sayles do any other kind?
1.0,1074022-lone_star,i really need to see this again.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"Another piece of America's dark history. Sayles is a master storyteller. Being given a synopsis is no good, you just have to sit back and enjoy the tale with the enthusiasm of a jackanory story and enjoy the characters unfold..."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"Everything comes together - plot, performances, scripting and sub-text. A fantastic film about love, our pasts and how they shape each other."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,Excelente guión y dirección de John Sayles. Excelentes actuaciones.
0.0,1074022-lone_star,a shockingly awful movie
1.0,1074022-lone_star,John Sayles kicks ass again with this bad boy.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,Incredibly well-constructed story with fantastic acting.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,Brilliantly written film about assimilation verses multiculturalism in the conservative yet highly diverse milieu of a fictional Texas town.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"I can't think of a film that evokes a setting and a bygone era as completely (and wonderfully) as ""Lone Star"". Would have worked just fine as a plot-driven murder mystery, but Sayles' terrific script and attention to detail make it so much more. Recommended."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,One of my favorites.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,John Sayles at his best.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,Amazing observations on southwestern/border lifeways embedded in a terrific plot. This is worth owning and watching over and over.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"John Sayles is a master at creating complex characters with interesting points of view and stories that move you to question the world you live in. This movie is his magnum opus. It's also the movie that made Chris Cooper famous--though fans of Sayles remember him from ""Matewan."""
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"An underrated gem from the mid-90s by American indie hero John Sayles. Few films boast a screenplay this rich, characters this well developed."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"This movie has it all....a great story, great acting, and a compelling mystery!"
1.0,1074022-lone_star,Rent this and help me pay off college loans.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"You need to see this movie, especially now with the debate over immigration. Besides that it is part of John Sayles's history of America approach and does complexity instead of simplicity."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,A wonderful film showing how the issues of immigration and living on both sides of the border have been complex and bedeviling for generations.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"A whodunnit of a 40 year-old crime in a small Texas town is twisty, racially relevant and charged with energy and wit. Excellent."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"Love John Sayles, love Chris Cooper, love this movie. Just saw it again for the first time since it came out and it totally holds up. Nowadays, interlocking plotlines are commonplace, of course, but this was one of the first."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,I don't want to give anyone any information about this movie. Just watch and enjoy.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,A great TEXAS movie.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,Nobody captures real live in the U.S. like John Sayles
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"Not a Western per se, this is the film that got me interested in watching cowboy movies. John Sayles made the entire cast shine (by the way, they mention Laredo, Texas!)"
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"Love it. A slow, complex cowboy kind of movie."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,I enjoyed the gradual revelation of several complex small-town relationships (some obvious and some not) as the sheriff investigates the discovery of a long dead body in the desert.  The transitions in and out of flashback were amazing.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,This is one of my top 5 movies ever.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"One of the best films of the 90s. Comments on history and releveant sociopolitical issues, all the while telling a great story in an original way. Sayles is a very conscious fillmmaker, and that certainly comes through here. One of the best final shots of any film."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,One of the most fascinating movies I have ever seen. It is strange how the movie develops layers to it's story. The performances are subtle yet effective. This is a classic.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"Sayles does a brilliant job condensing history - both cultural and personal - into a 134-minute yarn, examining how the murder of a sheriff thirty years ago affects people who are tied together today, whether they care to be or not."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,One of my all-time favorites.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,Like reading a great novel. Incredibly rich and layered story.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,One of the best movies I've ever seen! I can't believe I waited so long to see this; for some reason I was intimidated by it. But now I feel I've missed out by not seeing it sooner than I did!
0.0,1074022-lone_star,I like Sayles. I didn't like this.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,John Sayles the best most underrated director in cinema for twenty years running. Lonestar his most widely recognised achievement. Perfect.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"Complex and thoughtful with action to boot, and a star-making performance from Chris Cooper."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,Beautifully understated film. First time I became aware of the amazing Chris Cooper.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"True to life portrayal of the politics of life and love along the Border. And, one of my fave films of all time. Which says a lot."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"The interweaving stories in this movie are beautifully done, and the performances are top-notch! The last line of the movie is particularly haunting and resonant, especially for anyone from Texas."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"This is from the ever decling faction of American Cinema that still remembers how to make films properly. A superb piece of story-telling with great performances all round. Yes, even from McConaughy."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"Underrated, beautiful, and a good mystery."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,This movie is one of my favorites. It explores the complicated issues that surround family and cultural relationships.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,Pretty much how I grew up.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,John Sayles BEST FILM. A true orginal from the last true film auther working today.....AMAZING
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"The best movie I have ever seen, bar none."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,One of the underrated classics-- a brilliant study of character and Americana in a Texas border town.

1.0,1074022-lone_star,"John Sayles is a master, and this is one of his finest pieces. Love it."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"Yet another great movie by John Sayles. Chris Cooper is such a great actor that it barely matters how good the rest of the cast are (and they are very good). The ending is just lovely. Again, another humane film."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"La obra maestra de John Sayles y quizas su consagracion ante los ojos de mucha gente, su fuerte sigue siendo como guionista pero en esta pelicula demuestra su habilidad para la puesta en escena, un rompecabezas impecablemente construido"
1.0,1074022-lone_star,I love how patient this movie is. Not for viewers with low attention spans.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,This is NOT a dumb western the way it is being marketed. It's a smart love story and mystery. Brilliant.
0.0,1074022-lone_star,"wow, we actually had to watch this in a film class. i thought it was horrid. to terrible to even think about anymore."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,One of the best movies I've ever seen. Sayles hit it on this one.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,One of those films that makes me think American cinema still has a chance.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,Easily one of the best films of the 1990's and perhaps John Sayles'greatest achievement.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"John Sayles passes sin down from father to son, and across many borders. Beautifully realized flashbacks haunt scenes in the present. Extra credit for a brief history of the Black Seminoles."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,Sayles' best. Takes local politics in a South Texas bordertown and turns it into a grand tale. Has a lot to say about illegal immigration and class differences in America - it's more relevant than ever.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"The great American novel as cinema, by the vastly underrated John Sayles..."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"All the other reviewers pretty much nail it. Just wanted to add another positive, enthusiastic encouragement for those who haven't seen it to go out and watch it. It's amazing."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,John Sayles best film.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,John Sayles is one of the best indy directors out there today. This film is one of his best.

1.0,1074022-lone_star,An almost perfect film. This is Sayles firing on all cylinders. Mature filmmaking.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"More great film noir, great suspence, intense characters and a terrific mystery."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,One of those extremely rare COMPLETE movies. It's outta sight.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,"One of the great movies of the nineties, and my fave Sayles-directed work."
1.0,1074022-lone_star,Beautiful movie. I just get lost in the story and once again a great romance at the center.
1.0,1074022-lone_star,The power of great storytelling.Another classic any movie lover should own.

1.0,the_young_girls_of_rochefort,"Colorful, fun, and full of dancing and music, ""The Young Girls of Rochefort"" is probably the first French musical I've ever seen, and it's catchy tunes and upbeat jazz stylings have made it an instant favorite of mine."
0.0,the_young_girls_of_rochefort,"I don't know why this is so highly rated. Although it has star appeal, the writing is abyssmal, the music boring and repetitive, the dance numbers uninspired, and the storyline formulaic. As a musical, it's at its weakest point, but it doesn't work as a rom-com either. I struggled to get through it."

1.0,the_young_girls_of_rochefort,"Simply charming, with Deneuve and Dorleac..."
0.0,the_young_girls_of_rochefort,A very disappointing musical from Jacques Demy - terrible story and boring songs. The costumes are farcical: trousers tucked into white boots? You can see the terrible glint of Xanadu in Gene Kelly's droopy eyes. Much better to watch Umbrellas of Cherbourg again.

1.0,y_tu_mama_tambien,Terrific film. Cuaron may be my favorite Mexican director. Interesting study of young sexuality set against the backdrop of Mexican government. Very well done.
1.0,y_tu_mama_tambien,"As sexually free as the road trip is long, Y Tu Mama Tambien makes for an excellent experience."
1.0,y_tu_mama_tambien,"A powerful and beautiful film. Cuaron explores the essence of intimacy and friendship with an extremely talented and provoking cast. The movie pushes boundaries viscerally and mentally, with a range that spans from facetious to melancholic, across the entire emotional spectrum."
1.0,y_tu_mama_tambien,Why hadn't I seen this before?!?!? And why hasn't CuarÃ³n made a feature-length film in half a decade?!?

1.0,y_tu_mama_tambien,I love this movie (and how can you go wrong with Diego Luna and Gael Garcia Bernal) There's so much heart and its such an emotionally riveting film. Beautiful.
1.0,y_tu_mama_tambien,After living in Mexico for 6 months and watching this movie I can say that this was one of the most raw depictions of the culture I had ever seen. Very real and captivating. A refreshing break from typical hollywood films. Very well done.
1.0,y_tu_mama_tambien,"This movie is amazing... funny and ended in a way I never would have guessed... I guess on the surface it seems almost like pornography, but the way it ends makes it intelligent"
1.0,y_tu_mama_tambien,A Spanish-language teenage sex comedy that is really about maturity and the future of Mexico. Cuaron's filmmaking is dazzling. Don't miss this one.

1.0,y_tu_mama_tambien,100% best road movie
1.0,y_tu_mama_tambien,"One of the top 20 greatest films ever made due to its balance of humor, social commentary, sex, and heart. This film is sexually graphic, but, it is not gratuitous due to the context."
1.0,y_tu_mama_tambien,"The greatest road trip movie ever. Well acted, directed, and written. Funny, sexy, and downright entertaining. Alfonso Cuaron is a force to be reckoned with."
1.0,y_tu_mama_tambien,"On its surface, it is a almost-hedonistic coming-of-age road trip film which is downright sexy. If you become a little more observant, the subtle political advocacies are there."

1.0,y_tu_mama_tambien,This movie is so much like reality. Friends will come and go
1.0,y_tu_mama_tambien,"Cuaron's coming-of-age erotic road trip film is as provocative and melancholic a ""teen"" film you're likely to see. Possibly the best Mexican film of the 00s."

1.0,y_tu_mama_tambien,"Beautifully filmed coming of age Mexican road movie which is in turn funny, outrageous and poignant. The film is brilliantly but I particularly loved the photography on the road which really captures the back waters of Mexico. One of the world cinema releases of the last 10 years."
1.0,y_tu_mama_tambien,Alfonso Cuaron is the Christopher Nolan of Mexican filmaking. There's no flaws with this movie. It's simply a great drama film.
1.0,y_tu_mama_tambien,"PICK OF THE WEEK... in honor of Summer: hot, sticky and fun... and because we're entering the final week of shooting 'Mamitas'."
1.0,y_tu_mama_tambien,Diego Luna is SEXY!!!!! lol love this movie
1.0,y_tu_mama_tambien,This movie might be considered borderline pornography by some but I think that this movie is a masterpiece.
1.0,y_tu_mama_tambien,"In the hands of less talented actors and director, this might have been a cheap teen sex comedy. With Cuaron and a wonderful cast, however, it's a very mature, bold movie that still manages to be quite funny at times. An unforgettable film that should be counted among the decade's best."
1.0,y_tu_mama_tambien,an all time great film...i watch this movie at least once every two years or so.

1.0,y_tu_mama_tambien,A road-trip coming-of-age story about two sex-craving teens who take a young woman on a journey in search of a perfect beach. This is also a social commentary of Mexico. One of the finest films of the decade with outstanding performances and assured direction by Cuaron.
1.0,y_tu_mama_tambien,"OMG, this is a must to see!! Naturally compelling atmosphere throughout the movie story. It takes place in Mexico, describing the relashionship among friends during a trip that probably will change their life for ever."
1.0,y_tu_mama_tambien,"To your girlfriends, who are doing ten Italians at a time!"
1.0,y_tu_mama_tambien,There's not too many lovers of authentic Mexican filmmaking. This film is clearly the best film to ever come from Mexico.
1.0,y_tu_mama_tambien,"this movie is thousand times deeper than it seems, it's about life, about friendship, about lessons in life, showing us both sides of Mexico and also of peoples' relations. it shows much more than a teenage drama I think. It definitely gets 5 stars, no doubt."
1.0,y_tu_mama_tambien,"Inspiring, moving and very sexy."

1.0,y_tu_mama_tambien,"This was brilliant. yes, brilliant, a word I don't use everyday. Not since ""7 years in tibet"" have I seen such an enigmatic, passionate and riveting tale on friendship.

1.0,y_tu_mama_tambien,"Really funny, and really sad."

1.0,y_tu_mama_tambien,I can watch this movie over and over again.
1.0,y_tu_mama_tambien,"One of the best movies I've ever seen. It's fast, funny, sad, and ultimately devastating. It starts out as a teen sex comedy and morphs into as a heartbreaking lamentation for time gone by."

1.0,y_tu_mama_tambien,This movie is one of those rare movies that captures the very fickle and very deep nature of friendships. It gracefully shows how quickly life can change almost dramatically in the blink of an eye. Powerful and very emotional.
1.0,y_tu_mama_tambien,A perfect film. A seductive bildungsroman; the competition between the boys unassumingly reveals the irreconcilable unevenness of capitalist development.

1.0,y_tu_mama_tambien,"One of maybe two movies I have ever gone to see twice. Incredibly sexy, with some social commentary thrown in for good measure. Luisa is one of my favorite female characters: strong, independent, smart, and totally in control of these two jokers."

1.0,y_tu_mama_tambien,"A coming-of-age road movie that gracefully navigates a taut course between class and style, love and lust, sex and gender, living fully and dying."
1.0,y_tu_mama_tambien,don't think i've had such an emotional response to a film since before sunrise - and that thing changed my life. you can bandy around terms like 'life-affirming' but rarely is it as applicable here. and of course the sex is always good.
1.0,shakespeare_in_love,"Nice movie, my intro to the brother of Ralph Fiennes"

1.0,manhattan,"A lyrical, witty ode to New York! Full of wonderful characters that don't feel like Woody Allen stereotypes (something most Woody Allen characters do now), a visual flair (that bridge scene!) and Gerswhin's music! I could watch it again and again and again!"

1.0,manhattan,Beauty. Beauty. Beauty!
1.0,manhattan,This film has had so much said about it I will only add two things 1) I think it was the inspiration for the Seinfeld series 2) How is it that having a sexual relationship with a 17 year old Mariel Hemingway is a problem?
1.0,manhattan,"Perhaps Allen`s most personal film, it is not as funny as Annie Hall, but it is probably more emotionally resonant."
1.0,manhattan,Woody again directs a movie with wit and heart. His romance for New York is shown with his great visuals of the city. Great performances from Allen and Diane Keaton and Mariel Hemingway.

1.0,manhattan,"100% Incredible, one of the best movies of Wody Allen"

1.0,manhattan,"It ranks among Allen's best works, his writing, directing, and even his acting is at his level best. It combines the humor of Annie Hall and the more reflective nature of his later stuff, so its really just a combination of all his greatest strengths."

1.0,manhattan,Woody Allen's best film.
1.0,manhattan,"There isn't a frame in it that doesn't look stunning in its black and white glory, the performances are great, and while not as funny as Annie Hall it is just as inspired, thought-provoking and telling."
0.0,manhattan,"Saw this because Meryl has a bit part, and when I say bit its an overstatement. I think she is in it maybe a minute, I love ya Meryl, but this wasn't worth it. I'm not a Woody Allen fan, and I find it hard to believe Meryl would be his ex-wife, among other things, in this crap movie."
1.0,manhattan,"This is one movie which actually gets better and better when you watch it again...Allen handles the intricacies of relationships so beautifully, and depicts Manhattan in a great light, Diane keaton and Allen always gel like anything and Meryl Streep though she comes in 2 frames looks sizzling."
1.0,manhattan,Just another beautifully told story is all.

1.0,manhattan,excelente visión sobre lo q es el amor en estos tiempos decayentesy mucho humor estilo woddy allen
1.0,manhattan,(****): Thumbs Up  Well-acted and well-directed. One of the best films of the 1970's.
1.0,manhattan,"This and ANNIE HALL are Woody Allen's defining works as a filmmaker, never has he spun a yarn of relationships, sex, and conversation in such a virtuosic manner. The fact that it's probably his best-looking work visually doesn't hurt either."
1.0,manhattan,oh my GOD ... such an amazing story line.
1.0,manhattan,"An extremely unconventional romantic-comedy, which goes in unexpected places, is a continuation of Woody Allen's romance with New York. Shot in utterly breathetaking black-and-white, a truly beautiful film about people walking around, talking, sleeping together, arguing, talking and ad infinum."
1.0,manhattan,I liked the way he liked his city =]
1.0,manhattan,Woody's best! One of my favorites
0.0,manhattan,did not like this at all
1.0,manhattan,Delved deeply into the whole matter...
1.0,manhattan,"masterpiece ....i am addicted to this filmmaker and i have seen all his films , even when just acting in another s film  but who is his best film ? this one or Zeling ?"
1.0,manhattan,"Even though this is an old movie, Manhattan still reflects the sexual relationship in the urban jungle. This movie is so simple that you can really enjoy the pure beauty of a cinema. Manhattan is also a classical presentation of the life of a New Yorker: literatus, the BOBOs, and artistic."
1.0,manhattan,New York har aldrig varit vackrare i svartvitt Ã¤n i den hÃ¤r filmen.
0.0,manhattan,I have a feeling that people who feel overly important will enjoy this.
1.0,manhattan,"I love this movie (filmed in glorious black and white), despite the fact that Woody Allen's personal history might tend to make it suspect."
1.0,manhattan,"A masterpiece amongst Woody Allen's films, comprised of intellectual wit and a very talented, well-acted cast... Not to mention, extraordinarily beautiful cinematography of a such a great city.""New York was his town, and it always would be..."""
1.0,manhattan,"Dealing with satisfaction, heartbreak, hope, and decay, ""Manhattan"" is Woody Allen's best film--he tackles each theme with his signature wit and insight in addition to garnering terrific performances from Keaton and Hemingway. It's the quintessential Woody Allen movie, simply put."
1.0,manhattan,"Beautifully photographed in black and white, if I wasn't in love with New York before I am now. Woody Allen's aptly called ""love song to New York"", Manhattan, was romantic, witty and full of captivating disenchantment."
1.0,manhattan,Diane Keaton and the cinematography
1.0,manhattan,"Hard to pick out a fault. The second Woody Allen film I watched, having already got to know Annie Hall pretty well... Ended up liking this one even more which was surprising. Undeniably witty, well-shot, casted... can't go wrong with this in my opinion."
1.0,manhattan,Allen's masterpiece.
1.0,manhattan,Woody Allen's best since Annie Hall.
1.0,manhattan,"I truly love Woody Allen, the women in this movie esp. Meryl, NEW YORK, cerebral self-discursive dialogue, sexuality, insecurity, the beauty of life, and this movie."
1.0,manhattan,a wise romantic dramedy which is lesser than Annie Hall but is more true than any of Allen's romantic movies. Mariel Hemingway and Diane Keaton are superb and definitive Allen females.
1.0,manhattan,Creo que lo que me gusta de Woody es que me da la oportunidad de ser un cotilla de entrar en las vidas de sus personajes y regodearme con sus éxitos y fracasos da la oportunidad de ver lo universal que son las búsquedas afectivas o de la felicidad.
1.0,manhattan,EÃ©n van de best Woody Allens: hilarisch met New York in prachtig zwart/wit.
1.0,manhattan,the best woody allen movie EVER
1.0,manhattan,"If there were more than 5 stars I would have given it to this movie. I always adored woody allen movies, but this one is so special. Beautifully shot, with an exquisite script, make this one movie one of the best treats one could indulge in."
1.0,manhattan,Amazing dialogue. Great music. Beautiful.
1.0,manhattan,Allen's best film IMHO
1.0,manhattan,"Perhaps Woody Allen's best and most honest of many wonderful and honest films. At times both intellectual, poignant and hilarious. His heroic quest for romance is amazingly done and very touching."
1.0,manhattan,"Absolutely classic. Woody Allen's best film, easily."
1.0,manhattan,Neck and neck with Annie Hall for Woody's best flick.
1.0,manhattan,this film is so beautiful to watch and Allen is so perfect for this role. This film delves into things more interesting and more realistic than Annie Hall. It' so interesting and so textured with a chaotic tale of love in the setting of an homage to the city that Allen loves.
1.0,manhattan,My favorite Woody Allen...
1.0,manhattan,"Another great work from Woody Allen. More than a few similarities to Annie Hall, but make no mistake: Manhattan is its own film, and it's just as great."
1.0,manhattan,Nazis understand baseball bats!
1.0,manhattan,"Wow. I loved this movie from heads to tails. Probably the best lines in the movie are delivered by Tracy, the pearl being the ironic ""You should have a little faith in people"" towards the end. Excellent shots of New York. Great Score. One of my favorites."
1.0,manhattan,"Manhattan jamas lucio tan hermosa y romantica como en esta cinta, una obra maestra del director Woody Allen, que debe verse como una secuela no oficial de ""Annie Hall""."
1.0,manhattan,"Manhattan is definitely my favorite Woody Allen film. Shot is stunning black & white, and full of smart humor, this is a beautiful little story about the complications of love, and is itself a love letter from Allen to the Big Apple. Manhattan is a winner."
1.0,manhattan,"Diane Keaton's smart, beautiful insecurity, combative pedantry, neurotic preoccupations, fickle cuntiness & tendency to date short, balding men really appeals to me. 5 stars."
1.0,manhattan,Probably my favorite thing Woody Allen's directed.
1.0,manhattan,"What a Marvelous movie, the beginning dialogue voiced by Woody and the Black and White shoot of Manhattan is mesmerising !"
1.0,manhattan,"one of allen's more romantic films. written, acted and shot perfectly."
1.0,manhattan,Solid performances and a mature Allen analyzing all aspects of human coupling.
1.0,manhattan,"I love that this movie is made up of a string of opened and honest conversations. Sure some elements of the conversations may be a bit pretentious for my liking, but it also took place in my favourite era in a city I long to visit."
1.0,manhattan,woody peaking in hostility A++
1.0,manhattan,Less meta than Annie Hall and completely gorgeous.
1.0,manhattan,"Allen's finest film is not only a portrait of the city he loves but also of the irrationality behind human relationships. His characters are some of the most authentic he's ever created and he plays his own role more toned down than normal, generating real sympathy."
1.0,manhattan,"woody allen, tony roberts, mariel hemingway, diane keaton"
1.0,manhattan,Woody Allen is the world's greatest story teller... nuff said
1.0,manhattan,The way Allen portrays the intellectually challenging woman as the most delectable creature to ever exist in the world of New York never ceases to amaze me--especially in this film.

1.0,manhattan,"While not containing as vividly sketched or engaging characters as Annie Hall or Hannah And Her Sisiters, Allen's film is one of beauty, where Manhattan itself becomes, probably, important than its leads."
1.0,manhattan,Meryll!!!!!(L)(L)GREAAATTTTT ammaaaaziiigggg
1.0,manhattan,"Annie Hall is funnier, and overall better as well, but Manhattan sure has the more beautiful cinematography. Still five-stars for sure, though. Another excellent look into relationships by the great Woody Allen."
1.0,manhattan,one of the best picture ever about new york. And there's the list of the things worth living..
1.0,manhattan,Great Woody Allen love story perfectly set to Gershwin!
1.0,manhattan,"Another classic from Allen. Once again, with fantastic writing, direction and a superb group of actors, he made a convincing portrayal of a person's life."
1.0,monsoon_wedding,This movie never suffers from any dull moment. Two love stories emerge from different parts of the economic spectrum.

1.0,monsoon_wedding,"Soundtrack is perfect. And the movie takes on a whole new shape after you're used to the Indian sounds. Story is nice, but not the most important thing. The visual aspect is what grasps the viewer - the flowers, colors and every detail related to the culture."

1.0,hannah_and_her_sisters,A perfect Bergmanesque existential artsy upper-middle-class New York slice-of-life dramedy. Woody's finest!
1.0,hannah_and_her_sisters,There's still this sense he's trying to figure something out rather than making new patterns out of stuff he's already done. I love this film
1.0,hannah_and_her_sisters,"What makes this film so special and unforgettable - right there with its flawless structure, impeccable direction, three-dimensional characters and phenomenal dialogue - is how Woody Allen is won over by such a surprising amount of optimism, and the result is just perfection."
1.0,hannah_and_her_sisters,"Vintage Woody Allen at his absolute best. Hilariously funny, touching, and intelligently written. The entire cast shines, but Dianne Wiest and Michael Caine are especially perfect, both of which won Oscars for their performances."
1.0,hannah_and_her_sisters,"With crisp editing and a pitch-perfect script, Allen spins his most hopeful and humanistic story."
1.0,hannah_and_her_sisters,How I identified with Hannah was too painful. Now this is much more well-structured tribute to Bergman than Interiors
1.0,hannah_and_her_sisters,The genius of the picture is the number of completely fleshed-out relationships and people Woody Allen juggles into one amazingly written screenplay.
1.0,hannah_and_her_sisters,"One of his finest films and definitely sports some of Woody's most poignant writing. Its three Oscars for Sir Michael Caine, Dianne Wiest and the screenplay are well deserved."

1.0,hannah_and_her_sisters,"Saw this film on New Years Eve 1986 at the BFI in London, watched it every year over the holidays ever since. Beautiful film although for years I misinterpreted the final scene with Woody and wife, thought she had cheated on him.. how cynical was I?!?!"
1.0,hannah_and_her_sisters,Everything about this movie is great. I love Woody!

1.0,hannah_and_her_sisters,Woody Allen for the uninitiated.
1.0,hannah_and_her_sisters,the best movie about the dysfunctional bourgeoisie?
1.0,hannah_and_her_sisters,"sisters... can't think of any community crazier than this!! it reminds you those facts about ""birth order"" stuff.. 1st child is the best child and so on and on... plus it has michael caine like we'd never seen before :)"
1.0,hannah_and_her_sisters,"Fantastic performance, brilliant script, memorable characters, intelligent and insightful, why did I wait so long, this is now my favorite Allen film. I don't think he will do better than this one, ever. 5 stars, easily."
1.0,hannah_and_her_sisters,"Woody Allen is always himself in this movies. OK. Besides that, another great story, very well told; that's why WA is a genius: he sees the complexity in every situation and brings it to the screen in such a simple way. Or would it be the opposite? Human beings being human, WA style!"
1.0,hannah_and_her_sisters,One of Allen's best along with Annie Hall and Bullets Over Broadway. A sharply written movie about family dynamics. Wiest is outstanding. Allen's loving shots of NY in the 80s is exquisite.
1.0,hannah_and_her_sisters,"My favorite Woody Allen movie ever. It's so funny and observant, and ultimately moving. I probably watch it at least twice a year and it gets richer and more insightful each time."

1.0,hannah_and_her_sisters,Dianne Wiest cracks me up in this one.
1.0,hannah_and_her_sisters,Top tier Woody Allen flick. Great acting and characters all around. At its heart it's a movie about family and that is somewhat unusual for Woody. Perfect mix of comedy and sentimentality.
1.0,hannah_and_her_sisters,"My favorite Woody Allen film, so far. Part insightful romantic comedy, part melodrama. Elegently divided into chapters with overlapping plots. Great acting, great angle on the city, classy soundtrack."

1.0,hannah_and_her_sisters,This is my Cassablanca.
1.0,hannah_and_her_sisters,"It's almost frightening how natural the characters feel. As usual, Allen's own ""character"" could be cut from the film, but he is nevertheless a fantastic director and screenwriter. There just so much here to love and hate and spend hours discussing."
1.0,hannah_and_her_sisters,"One of my favorite films ever. I can't get past the treatment of the characters... there is that usual dose of Woody Allen absurdity, but the people feel incredibly real."

1.0,hannah_and_her_sisters,"If you like gal-films, and ""Golden Girls"" and such, this is a lovely film. It is very ""New York,"" and that can annoy some people."
1.0,hannah_and_her_sisters,"""And Nietzsche, with his theory of eternal recurrence. He said that the life we lived we're gonna live over again the exact same way for eternity. Great. That means I'll have to sit through the Ice Capades again. It's not worth it..."" My favorite Woody Allen film."

1.0,midnight_in_paris,It really doesn't get more perfect than this.
1.0,midnight_in_paris,Being able to take a common human predicament and put it into a jarringly relatable is one of Woody Allen's most effective gifts.

1.0,midnight_in_paris,Instantly became one of my favorite movies. Woody Allen does an exceptional job with everything.

1.0,midnight_in_paris,"I have to say Owen Wilson was terrific in this movie. This I will call a personal favorite because if you have been to Paris or consider yourself a romantic, you will be pondering thoughts of where you would want to journey. But not only where, but in what time era."

1.0,midnight_in_paris,"An excellent movie, with great shots of Paris. Well done Woody Allen!"

1.0,midnight_in_paris,"Beautiful and funny, this movie will bring you back to the past, let you meet artists such as Hemingway, Picasso, Fitzgerald, in the flesh.

1.0,brokeback_mountain,A terrific film. Both Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal were fantastic. I thought this was Heath Ledger's best acting spot (didn't are for his Joker portrayal). The ending was sad since Jake's character died and the two of them couldn't live happily ever after with each other.

0.0,brokeback_mountain,"I did not get to finish the movie because the 15 minutes of how their relationship started was obviously enigmatic. Bisexual or not, straight men just don't easily give into rape. No person in their right mind would want to have a relationship with a rapist. Period."

1.0,american_in_paris,"What is there not to like: Minnelli, Kelly, Caron, and Gershwin! It has a very 1950's era sensibility about male and female roles but I view that sociologically/historically."
1.0,american_in_paris,"Somehow the fact that is movie was made in the middle of the 20th century is important, I just haven't had time to figure out why! lol..... In musical cinema this is one of the most artistically modern in its dancing."

1.0,american_in_paris,"To me far superior than Singi'n In The Rain, much more artistic and ambitious. Plus the Gershwin doesnt hurt either. Kelly is at his peak, artistically and most of in the choreagraphy. The highpoint of the MGM machine."
0.0,american_in_paris,This probably worked in 1951 by now - Dead boooring... the dance scene in the end lasts fooooreeveeer and is most likely choreographed by a Gene on Absinthe.
1.0,american_in_paris,Gershwin meet Kelly could not go wrong. Awesome movie!

1.0,american_in_paris,Of all the great MGM musicals this is the one I return to over and over again. Fantastically imaginative choreography and a beautiful Gershwin score.
1.0,american_in_paris,My favorite Gene Kelly movie. I love how Kelly's modern dance juxtaposes with Leslie Caron's classical ballet.
1.0,american_in_paris,"It has its lengths, the plot gets occasionally creaky but the music, the choreography, the ambition make this an outstanding musical. When Hollywood's fake versions of places were so great it didn't matter they weren't the real thing."
1.0,american_in_paris,Oh..this was a great movie..I enjoyed every piece of it specially the dance and the paris scenery

1.0,american_in_paris,"If this film proves nothing else, it proves that telling Gene Kelly he can't actually film in Paris just pisses the man off and he makes the best frickin musical ever filmed to spite you.

1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,A candid look at the struggles of veterans returning from the battlefields of World War II. Frederic March leads an impressive group of veteran actors but non actor Harold Russell steals the playing a veteran who lost his arms during the war.

1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,I just discovered this movie and it was awesome.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"Interesting to see how most people thought about war vets in 1946. Also, adultery was way more taboo back then than it is today so it was interesting to see that issue in an old film like this. Overall, it was beautifully shot and a well structured story. Highly recommended."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"A TRUE MASTERPIECE, as relevant today as when it was released."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"You can toss aside old tanks, old aircraft and old guns....but not old soldiers. Thsi well made, beautifully acted film is of teh harsh reailities of what happens to good men after wars are fought and won. One of the top 20 films of all-time."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"Great movie, even if some of the conventions are totally dated (a soft light bulb magically appears above a woman's face whenever there's anything romantic going on). I also liked how you get to see what America looked like in the mid-40s. I recommend it."

1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"Man, this movie sticks with me. Simple stories well told of veterans and their families finding their way after the war is over.

1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,Perfect movie for Veterans Day.

1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,Saw this many years ago but just recently re-experienced this tremendous film. Remarkable perspective for its time with Wyler's unique way of creating visual impact with his camera shots along with amazing performances.

1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,Just an absolutely perfect film. And so courageous for its day. One of the most wonderful ensembles I've ever seen in one of the most human of all classic American films. William Wyler gives us his masterpiece.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"My introduction to Myrna Loy, Fredric Marsh, and awesomeness in general. One of my favorite films, the first hour is absolutely perfect."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,Ground breaking. Vicious and heart breaking. Ten times more brutal then Coming Home which came out 40 years later.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,WAsn't to sure what to expect thought it would be preachy propaganda about how rosy life is after people get out of the war. Glad to see that it wasn't the case with this movie.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"three hours long and worth every minute of your time.. if you are going to invest in an old ww2 era movie... This is the one. about life, love , and America."

1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"Beautiful, sentimental classic. I love this movie. I watch it again and again. (I have a thing for Dana Andrews anyway.) How it avoided being sappy/sticky I can't really understand, but it does. I really loved the relationship between Fredric March and Myrna Loy. We should all be so lucky in love!"
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"As long as there will be wars, this movie will remain timeless."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"I consider this to be one of the best war movies that I have ever seen, since it does not focus on the battles. Every part of this movie is amazingly done and it had more of an effect on me than war films that show the brutality of the battlefield."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"William Wyler's best film is post-war classic telling story of American verterans returning home and readapting to life. Brilliant performances and superb direction, not to mention excellent cinematography from the master of deep-focus, Greg Toland."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"Really, utterly fantastic. I wish I could single out certain members of the cast for their performances, but they were all such standouts that I can't do it in good conscience. Good job (again), William Wyler."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,Amazing. Great movie about WW2 vets coming home. It is a Hollywood twist on Italian neo-realist movies and pulls it off quite well. Harold Russell does a great job acting as a non-professional actor (only appeared in two TV cameo roles later in life). This movie is perfect.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,Incredible and deeply moving.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"A priceless treasure from the post WWII amercian production. This brings to the screen a very emotional play but in a very subtle manner, suggesting feelings of human despair and deep friendship rather than displaying them. Simply beautiful."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,What a GREAT movie. War heros coming home and how they adapt to getting back to 'normal life'. What an amazing film!!
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,great storytelling...content...craft...cinema
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"I laughed (at March), I cried, it became a part of me. Really. Wyler keeps it wonderfully low-key, which lets the movie hold up 60 years later. Beautiful continuous takes from Gregg Toland (one of his last films before his untimely death)."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,A much better movie than you're expecting. It was really great by any standard.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,I cry every time I see this shockingly contemporary movie.Myrna Loy and Teresa Wright destroy the screen with their performances. Harold Russell as homer parish and the Amazing Fredrich March and Dana Andrews are all fantastic.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,A film deeply invested in the people it depicts. Its love for them is humbling. As good a melodrama as I can remember seeing.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"This is the movie that made me fall in love with classic Hollywood. It is honest, funny, heartwarming and moving. Perfect."

1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,I recommend this to all.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,The first film to deal with the post-war experience of returning veterans. Everyone shines in this film that deserves a Top 10 slot on any legitimate American film list. Harold Russell puts on a performance that really cuts one in two. An example of great writing.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,A brave look at how WWII vets fared (or didn't) after 1945. Compelling performances complment Robert Sherwood's wonderful script.

1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,A true classic in every sense. 3 war veterans return from Europe to find how much their lives back home have changed. Few movies really tap into family and romantic dynamics as well as this film does. A must see.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"a resolute classic that's still relevant in today's society. this film avoids the tendency toward trite and overbearing notions, while successfully achieving a deep sentimentality. a compelling, heartfelt example of the best in early american movie-making."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"I haven't seen this in a while, but I remember thinking it was five stars, so here it is. I really love this movie and it amazing me that the handicap man could win an Oscar and this was his first movie."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,This is a groundbreaking movie because it portrays WW2 veterans returning home and trying to resume their lives. The film follows three story lines which are all equally compelling. This is a true American classic.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"Yep, it doesn't take long for this one to reduce even the hardest of hearts into a heap of molten muscle."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,One of my favorite movies of all time.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"This one beat out ""It's a Wonderful Life"" at the Oscars in 1947, and with good reason: it's a much better film. Entirely worth seeing. You've seen war films, but when have you seen a great post-war film?"
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,sad but true. deer hunter has a similar but less effective poignancy. really nice ending.

1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"Frederic March for the win!!! Harold Russel is delightfully heartbreaking as well, and I love the fish out of water feel, as well as the class distinction between the primaries: upper, middle, and lower. I could go on, and on, and on- but I won't."

1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,The greatest film of William Wyler's career with superb performances all around.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"Awesome, awesome movie. One opf the very few that took a deep look into the GI ""boys"" that came back from WWII to find a whole new world. YOu are right. Things don't change. Bit no one wanted to tell that story back then. Courageous film"

1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,The greatest movie ever made. Period.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"One of my all-time favourite films. This 1946 classic is beautiful, moving and uplifting."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,Ever wonder what happens after the 'happily ever after' of most WWII era films? What really happened when the war ended and soldiers came home to their lives and their wives only to find the world truly has changed... and so have they. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,An amazing and entirely unsentimental look at veterans returning home from World War II.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,Classic film. Obviously I recommend it-- everyone should see it at least once. Though it is hard to sell a movie made more than 30 years ago to a crowd my age. Sad really. Thank you Mr. Walch.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,A poignant look at the post-WWII lives of servicemen
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,One the most touching and inspiring movies of all time. It shows you the effects of war on the soldiers and the ones left behind. Wonderful
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,Amazing post WWII movie with these amazing inter connecting stories of these three men. Harold Russell makes me cry everytime I see this movie.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"A wonderfully accurate portrayal of what it was like to come back from war,and realize that you and those you left behind have changed, although many other parts of your life remained at a standstill. I also enjoyed Hoagy Carmichael's small but integral part in this fantastic movie."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"This movie is just so great on many levels. It's one of those rare films that shows life beyond the battlefield. There are three story lines, interwoven, with three different points of view."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,Glossy but very powerful thanks to some fine acting and a marvelous screenplay. Dana Andrews will break your heart and Myrna Loy will make you proud.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,Wonderful film. Everyone should see it at least once.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"Amazing film, in every aspect."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"The kind of movie not often see, where soldiers returning from war go through a period of adjustment that often goes unmentioned. Very moving and well-acted."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,if I had the money I would buy Harold Russell's (multi-amputee Homer) the academy award he won and give it back 2 him.. (he sold it 2 pay 4 bills) mind u he's never acted b4 or after this film!
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"Ah, the pastoral life of post-war America. Or, maybe not. This quiet, moving portrait follows the painful adjustment both soldiers and their families had to make at the end of WWII."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,I saw only about 3/4th of this film but it is AWESOME
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"Pyschologically and historically surpirsing. Revealed that even the ""Good War"" had left its veterans high and dry with the emotional and physical help they needed."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"THE ultimate William Wyler film. 3 hours long, but worth every minute!"
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"Sentimental, filled with cliches, and overlong, but filled with an earnest feeling that helps truly examine what veterans had to go through upon coming back. This movie truly shows that actual combat is only the beginning of the consequences of a war."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,Extremely interesting movie about veterans trying to readjust and deal with their own issues. Why do I keep thinking about post-college life?
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"An honest account of how three soldiers cope with the re-intergration into society. Blunt, honest and a real insight into the trauma that serviceman suffer from adjusting to a civilian life."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,So much cheese but its so good!
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"Amazing film, especially when you consider it was made so close to the end of the war. Dealt truthfully with the tribulations on men returning from battle with scars, some visible and some not. I particularly like the music when Dana Andrews' character has the flashback in the plane graveyard."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,Incrdible filmmaking from Post-War Hollywood.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"Great movie, especially considering the year in which it was made. As long as you don't focus too much on the charicatures of women, the subject matter is very compelling. It might feel like slow going compared to 21st century action adventure blockbusters, but it's got some fine performances."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"A classic film, clearly deserving of the Oscar it received, ""Best Picture 1946""."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,One of the best movies EVER!! Please do yourself a favor and watch it!!
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,movie making at it's best... they don't make 'em like this anymore.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"This is probably the best post war movie ever. It is about three guys and how their lives have changed since they came back from war. Each is effected by it differently, and yet the same. You owe it to yourself to see this movie."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"A timeless classic. Just as relevant with the Iraq war today as it was when it came out. Has not aged at all in 60 years. Great, great movie."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,I Cry Histarically Everytime. Must See!
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"If anyone wants to know how it feels to come home from the military and try to adjust back to life, this is the movie. It shows that no matter what you did or was youre changed forever and you can only move forward."

1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"A perfect piece of cinema. Moving, and it's nice to see films from the war-era not afraid to show the negative effects of battle."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"A riveting, if a little dated, tale of three vets who come home. Only one has obvious physical scars but all are shattered emotionally. This is a gem of a movie, but be warned, it is very long and may require an intermission or two."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"Beautiful, beautiful film, made more poignant by the performance of Harold Russell who actually lost his hands in WWII. This is the ultimate coming home movie."

1.0,roman_holiday,"A ""must-watch"" movie showing the best of Hepburn and Peck, and the city of Rome. Romantic comedies are usually easy to forget, but this one has multiple scenes that are so iconic."

1.0,roman_holiday,I have no idea why... But obsessed!
1.0,roman_holiday,"The first parts of the movie is really just light hearted comedy, very fun to watch.

1.0,roman_holiday,"""Roman Holiday"" is remarkable just because Audrey Hepburn isn't gratingly over-the-top as she is in most movies. ""Roman Holiday"" is well-scripted and well-acted with gorgeous visuals shot on location in Italy. It's a charming film with wit fresh enough for a modern audience."
1.0,roman_holiday,"So understated - unimaginably so in today's fast-paced world. The last scene is unbearably poignant - yet completely silent, little movement, no music - just magical. Treasure this. M"

1.0,roman_holiday,"A pleasant trip through an exotic location. While Audrey Hepburn's charm and charisma may steal the show, Gregory Peck is no second fiddle, bringing his excellent acting and sense of humor to his role in this lovely romantic drama."
1.0,roman_holiday,Another one of my '50s favorite. Hepburn & Peck's presents amazing performances. This film has truly captured romance in the beautiful scene of Rome.

1.0,roman_holiday,The last scene itself deserve 2 stars... Audrey Hepburn deserves 1... everything else can make up the remaining 2.
1.0,roman_holiday,Audrey Hepburn shines in this film and delivers her best performance I have yet to see. The movie is a tragic love story and a story of freedom and responsibility. All the cast I'd magnificent in this film check it out if you love great movies.

1.0,roman_holiday,I just want to hug Audrey Hepburn whenever I see her. Even with the boy haircut. Gregory Peck was a douche bag in real life but I can get past it here. I don't even mind William Wyler direction. That's why the actress is more important than everything else.

1.0,roman_holiday,another fave audrey movies...
1.0,roman_holiday,"Seen it once, seen it twice, seen it so many times, I've lost count. Every moment from the beginning, I was hooked on it. Roman Holiday had everything, love, charm, laughter and a bit of drama. And the lighter-camera? Awesome. ;D"

1.0,roman_holiday,"Romantic without being a romance, not really. Hope no one ever tries to remake this story. They'd ruin it. Today's audiences are too jaded, and Hollywood would most likely miss the mark altogether."

1.0,roman_holiday,"A black and white movie, which is actually a historic one due to magnificent scenes shot in Rome in the 1950's (one of the first roles for Audrey Hepburn). I have to say that I prefer her in Tiffany's, but still a movie which deserves a place in my collection for historic reasons;"

1.0,obvious_child,Just rewatched it for the 5th time.

0.0,obvious_child,"Obvious child is obvious crap. A very unlikeable comedian has ""issues"" and the audience is meant to feel something when she deals with her issues."
0.0,obvious_child,"This movie sucks. It's a rom-com with very little rom and absolutely no com. Jenny Slate is pretty good, though; someone should put her in a better movie."

1.0,obvious_child,"One of those that you didn't want to end. Lots of fart humor, but it didn't bother me as it usually does. It was essential to the character. A real human story with love."
0.0,obvious_child,One of the worst stories and movies I've seen this year. I stopped watching 1/3 of the way through and wish I could get that time back. Superficiality has risen to new levels.
0.0,obvious_child,This is a movie about lazy worthless self absorbed murderers who have waisted 28 years of there lives and think it wouldn't be a big deal to not give the child they created a chance to live out their life.
1.0,obvious_child,"What a wonderful experience this was. The characters are as real as they get and the movie's not afraid to voice its opinion on a VERY controversial issue that women face. It's engrossing, hilarious and poignant."
1.0,obvious_child,"The most real, relatable and hilarious movie I have seen for ages."
0.0,obvious_child,Witty dialogs but flat pointless characters. I particulary find sad how it approaches abortion as if it was a visit to the dentist. Terrible movie
0.0,obvious_child,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. It is about a female comic who isn't funny. It's full of potty humor and jokes about abortion. It's dull and plodding, and it ends with a thud. 90 minutes of my life I will never get back."
1.0,obvious_child,Very funny and poignant
1.0,obvious_child,A fantastic comedy that takes an honest look at abortion.
1.0,obvious_child,"Although it subjects can be difficult to swollow at times, this bold and very mature story takes advantage of a very talented and delightful Jenny Slate and an assured and ultimately honest work of writer-director Robespierre"

0.0,obvious_child,Worst movie ever!The only reason why abortion could be ok is because people who are ok killing a baby/fetus don't deserve to be parents!
0.0,obvious_child,A very depressingly untruthful movie for a generation that deserves more on such an important decision as abortion. A young Woman and Man should CHOOSE any other film to go to on date night.

1.0,obvious_child,Hilarious. Definitely a top fiver.
0.0,obvious_child,It appears the only people that went to see this movie were the reviewers and the actors families. The subject matter is not funny and a tragic reminder how some have so little regard for life.

1.0,obvious_child,"finally! a real movie, with real people, and real stories. carry on like this; i have yet to met anyone who does not like this one!"
1.0,obvious_child,"A romantic comedy in which the characters have more to them than a bizarre and incredible failure to communicate? That is occasionally vulgar, but in the ways women actually are and not just the ways guys imagine? In which the ""love interest"" is even remotely appealing? Excellent."
0.0,obvious_child,Was very pumped about seeing this. Disliked the main character very much. Her comedy wasn't funny - it was awkward and uncomfortable. Did not enjoy at all. And not because of story about abortion. Because she was an unlike able character.
0.0,obvious_child,"horrible dreadful movie making light of abortion, which in essence, is murdering a child. found the whole movie to be disgusting."

1.0,obvious_child,If you do not like the the first 5 mins of the film leave I am not going to waste your time. If you take a chance you will LOVE it the way I did. This film is over the top sarcastic.
0.0,obvious_child,"A movie glorifying the ""liberal"" woman; one with no dignity or respect for herself. Maybe the writers who wanted a ""realistic"" abortion story should have read all the studies that find that an overwhelming majority of women who get an abortion regret it. Horrible movie."
0.0,obvious_child,An interesting story that is fully undermined by the mindless vulgarity.
0.0,obvious_child,"I saw a preview and walked out.. beyond bad... trite, uninspired and banal.."
1.0,obvious_child,"Not a perfect film (David Edelstein is right that the Max role is underdeveloped), but so entirely up my alley that I had to give it five stars. Takes on abortion seriously, and is also a well-timed, convincing rom-com. And with Gaby Hoffman as the advice-giving older BFF! Perfection, really."
1.0,obvious_child,Great movie. Jenny Slate is amazing in it.
1.0,obvious_child,"Hilarious, sweet, realistic."
1.0,obvious_child,See it if you like uncomfortable & crazy with your funny. It's brilliant!

1.0,before_midnight_2013,"Creo que es redundante decir que es la mas ""adulta"" de la trilogia. Aunque sigo prefiriendo un poco mas Sunset, me gustaron un poco mas las largas secuencias de charlas existencialistas de esta. Definitvamente el Drama/Romance del año."

1.0,before_midnight_2013,"The characters talk, sit, talk, eat, talk, walk, discuss, drive, argue, talk, and every moment is engaging. It forces introspection about life, death, relationships, the modern world's effect on the human condition, all in unfamiliar ways. In Before Midnight, nothing happens and everything happens."
1.0,before_midnight_2013,"Brilliant. Brilliantly written, acted and directed. Completed the ""Before"" trilogy just so brilliantly, with almost 10 years gap between each, still never kill the flame."
1.0,before_midnight_2013,This is where it ends. This is how people start breaking up. --------I really agree with Celine. So I am pretty relieved when this movie ends as they talk about time machine . Everything fades and disappears so it has to end before midnight.

1.0,carol,This is a stunningly beautiful movie.
1.0,carol,"Todd Haynes' Carol is the height of details. Every prop, every glance, every sound - all add up to a delicate and enigmatic film that simply leaves you speechless. A warm film, despite the harsh, cold moral views of people in the 50s (when the film is set)."

0.0,carol,"If you are looking for a slow-as-molasses paced, artsy-fartsy movie about a sexual relationship between two women, that has barely any sex in it, then this movie is for you. Can't believe this movie merits an ""R"" rating. Very tame and pretty lame."
1.0,carol,"Pretty much my new favorite movie, or at least tied with my favorite, Sunset Boulevard (which is actually shown in Carol). Obssessed."

1.0,carol,"Extremely well acted, beautiful period piece. Mara Rooney's character reminds me of Audrey Hepburn at times (in appearance, anyhow).I didn't realize before I watched, but it is based on a book titled ""The Price of Salt"", which I am planning on reading due to the movie."
1.0,carol,"Stunning, heart wrenching, and so incredibly beautiful."
1.0,carol,"Shaped by Todd Haynes' fantastic direction and powered by a strong cast led by Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara, Carol lives up to its groundbreaking source material."
1.0,carol,"One of the most sophisticated love stories I've seen, especially with two female leads. The two actresses have incredible chemistry and convey volumes with just a look or a silence. I highly recommend it."
0.0,carol,"Borrrring. Maybe it was just me, but I didn't sense any sort of chemistry between the two. If anything, seemed like Mara's character was taken advantage of."

1.0,carol,"Lovely movie, everything from the sound track to the cinematography was amazing."

0.0,carol,so boring and very slow.
1.0,carol,"Following in the foot prints of his ""Far From Heaven"", Todd Haynes proves once again that he is a master of exploring the forbidden, repressed sexuality of the 1950's. Beautifully designed and directed with near perfect acting from stars Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara in their Oscar nominated roles."
1.0,carol,My favorite movie and made me fall in love with the talents of Cate Blanchett
1.0,carol,"Way better than the 74% it's getting from audience. Usually I say audience is right and critics are wrong , but not this time. This movies has layers of drama to it and Cate Blanchette gives quite a performance."

1.0,carol,Exquisite. Magical. Breathtaking.
1.0,carol,"This was a well made movie of two women in an illicit relationship, and the cost of such a relationship in the fifties."
0.0,carol,Cate Blachett used to be one of my favorite actors - that is until I struggled through this movie. The dialog was painfully slow and uninteresting. If it had lasted any longer I might have killed myself. Glad I didn't pay theater admission.

1.0,carol,Amazing! Loved it! Beautiful story.
1.0,carol,a romantic relationship between two women in the early 1950's where these kinds of relationships were considered taboo and many thought having psychological treatments or threatening lawyers could get you to change your mind on whom you love or loved. excellent actors and storyline.
1.0,carol,A brilliantly written movie with two astounding performances from Blanchett and Mara : a moving tale of lesbianism in a wonderful and seemingly very restrictive setting of the 1950's New York.

0.0,carol,"As soon as I saw that this was a lesbian movie, I was not surprised by the overly high rating by the ""critics."" It's why I don't pay attention to critics."
1.0,carol,the most important movie in my life at the moment

1.0,carol,Love it. Very touching story or love in time where love was only seen as heterosexual. This movie illustrates that love has no boundaries and love is between 2 people and doesn't need to be labeled.
1.0,carol,"Carol is an examination of attraction, a love story composed of light conversations and controlled melodrama, an aesthetic and observant work that is simultaneously passionate, curious, logical, and emotional."

1.0,carol,I really enjoyed. ð???
1.0,carol,"Outstanding, emotionally overwhelming movie that captures the essence of the early 1950s and the storms that erupt around falling in love. It is an homage, as well, to the essence of ""Brief Encounter"", ""Sunset Boulevard"", and ""Now, Voyager"" where affect and silence communicate more than mere words."

1.0,carol,"There is nothing about this film which is not beautiful. The acting, the setting, the costumes and the plot were utterly flawless. It was romantic but not in a wet Nicholas Sparks way. It was dramatic but not over the top. I honestly cannot fault it"
0.0,carol,so I'd say this is like watching paint dry but I hate to disparage paint... i though first that probably there was a good 10 minute movie in here trapped inside the body of a 2 hour movie.. but really that would really only be watching a smaller patch of paint dry.

1.0,howards_end,What can I say. Perfect acting by great masters.

1.0,on_the_waterfront,"Great. Just another reason to label Marlon Brando as one of the greatest actors ever.

1.0,1001115-apartment,"Simply put, the acting, writing, and direction are all so superb that you can't go wrong watching this film. You'd have to try hard to find something really wrong with this film."

1.0,1001115-apartment,"Truly great film,i saw it on a new years eve many moons ago and the vibe and feel of this movie make it my all time fave....watch it you wont be dissapointed"
1.0,1001115-apartment,a bittersweet comedy-drama with heartwarming performances by Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine. A womderful portrayal of human beings and of apartments at the infancy of the sexual revolution.
1.0,1001115-apartment,"unbeatable and truly gripping, just love it!!"
1.0,1001115-apartment,Every time I watch it I seem to fall in love with it all over again... but that's the way it crumbles...cookie wise.
1.0,1001115-apartment,"I picked up this movie because I am a huge Jack Lemon fan. What I didn't expect was his heartbreakingly wonderful portrayal of C.C. Baxtor. He is surrounded by powerful assholes yet he maintains his innocent and sweet nature. I truly enjoyed it, even if it was not the light comedy I expected."
1.0,1001115-apartment,Probably one of the top 3 movies of all time
1.0,1001115-apartment,It really pulls through when it comes to smart humor and great drama scenes.
1.0,1001115-apartment,"Funny, sad, and moving. Lemmon is at his best and McLaine is glowing."
1.0,1001115-apartment,I was enraptured from the start. It's a shame films aren't made like this anymore.
1.0,1001115-apartment,Loved it. What a beautiful Satire about city life and it's demands. I've seen an indian version of this movie too which is equally good.Jack Lemmon and Shirley McLaine hit it off so well. Just loved their chemistry. One of Billy Wilder's finest movies.
1.0,1001115-apartment,"Is it a comedy or is it a drama? It can easily be described as a black comedy, but that doesn't do it justice. Whatever it is it certainly showed why Jack Lemmon is so loved by everyone."
1.0,1001115-apartment,This actually deserves 6 stars out of 5. Fucking Genius!
1.0,1001115-apartment,What can I say about The Apartment? This is how films were supposed to be made. Watch it and enjoy.

1.0,1001115-apartment,"I guess this is a romantic comedy but honestly, this one's so good a man doesn't have to feel ashamed about seeing it, even without being forced to to it by a girlfriend."
1.0,1001115-apartment,"One of those love conquers all stories that work very, very well. But it's much more than a romance, it's a biting social satire in which the losers are not really losers and the winners are not really winners."
1.0,1001115-apartment,My favourite Billy Wilder movie. A must see. There's not any contemporary movie that can compare to it.
1.0,1001115-apartment,"funny, surprising, sweet.."

1.0,1001115-apartment,brilliantly written screenplay. not 1 useless word in such a great plot. jack lemmon is great to watch. It's a shame I left it so long before I got 'round to it...
1.0,1001115-apartment,"Really I would rate this beyond 5. It's a movie that has stuck with me though most of my life. Oddly, I didn't think of adding it here until I just saw the characters in a French movie refer to it"
1.0,1001115-apartment,"The best, darkest romantic comedy ever."
1.0,1001115-apartment,Cutest movie i have ever seen...You really feel bad for Jack Lemmon though; that poor mother fucker never catches a break.

1.0,1001115-apartment,Classic! film and watch it before they make a stupid remake!!!
1.0,1001115-apartment,EXCEPTIONNEL !Merci Dimitri.
1.0,1001115-apartment,"I finally saw this, and was impressed with how it kills every other romantic comedy that has ever been made. I mean, rom-coms are generally pretty crappy-that's a given. Not so with this one. Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine are great."
1.0,1001115-apartment,"Hurrah for Fran, Baxter, Sheldrake, Dreyfuss and Dobisch. Billy Wilder had a knack for smart and subtle studio era comedy like no other. In an era bound by formula, the Oscars deservedly swept this classic up and lauded it for everything it deserved. A must see for everyone."

1.0,1001115-apartment,Sharp. Dang sharp.
1.0,1001115-apartment,"This movie has romance, comedy and suspense all rolled into one terrific story. My favorite Jack Lemmon movie. It is easy to fall in love with a movie that allows you to fall in love with the characters and despise the antagonists, too. A wonderful movie to watch on a rainy or sunny day."
1.0,1001115-apartment,"One of the very best of the ""best picture"" winners."
1.0,1001115-apartment,"They really don't make movies like this anymore. Jack Lemmon is brilliant, Shirley MacLaine is sublime, and Fred MacMurray is truly frightening as the villain, especially for those who know him best as the good father on ""My Three Sons."" A Billy Wilder classic."
1.0,1001115-apartment,"Love it, stands the test of time well."
1.0,1001115-apartment,If anyone would serve me spaghetti on a tennis racket I think I would just die
1.0,1001115-apartment,"A romantic comedy masterpiece, featuring a cast from heaven. Wilder doesn't shy away from the darkness, layering whimsical, romantic material with adult themes, but never losing the deft comic appeal of the central love story. One of the greatest endings ever, too."
1.0,1001115-apartment,Both funny and sad at the same time. One of my favorite romantic movies. It amazes me how far ahead of its time this movie was when it came out.
1.0,1001115-apartment,"One of my favorite films. The kind of film you just want ""live in,"" odd for a film that's so claustrophobic too. This will make you want to see everything Jack Lemmon's ever done. Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond's screenplay doesn't have many equals."
1.0,1001115-apartment,One of my absolue favorite B&W; flicks.
1.0,1001115-apartment,a satire with a brilliant balance of comedy and drama
1.0,1001115-apartment,"To me, the perfect film: funny and sad; clever and warm; romantic and real. Marvellous acting. And on repeat viewings the technical brilliance of it becomes even clearer, eg the way the scene of the office party has been directed and shot. Just great."
1.0,1001115-apartment,Billy Wilder â?? What can you say. If you love movies then you must see his. Black and white but with all the color you could imagine in a movie.
1.0,1001115-apartment,witty one liners.....its more satisfying to get the girl of our dreams rather than working for a unrewarding job.......understated performances
1.0,mrs_brown,"A bit dry but Judi Dench saves the movie. Had to google and explain why the Royal family made a toast to Queen Victoria by saying, ""Victoria Regina"" as I had major looks of surprise and laughter on Emma and Lucy's faces. Emma: 9/10. Lucy: 7/10."
1.0,mrs_brown,One of the finest performances of all time. Dench was 62 when she received an Oscar nomination for playing Queen Victoria. It was the movie that gave her a film career....again......at 62!!
1.0,mrs_brown,"Thoroughly excellent historical drama, Billy Connolly holds his own opposite Judi Dench."
1.0,mrs_brown,the under current of Scots strength gives the viewer more to ponder than just British politcs of the time and chronic mourning

1.0,mrs_brown,Just amazing and robbed at the Oscars. Seriously??? Shakespeare in Love was more deserving than this unbelievable piece???
1.0,mrs_brown,My very favorite movie ever!! I absolutely love it. I love the scenes and the story is such great quality. And I love Billy Connolly's Irish accent!
1.0,mrs_brown,Billy Connolly and Judi Dench are perfect together.
1.0,mrs_brown,"Billy Connolly in a (very) straight role - absolutely brilliant portrayal of John Brown. The supressed intensity of the relationship between these two impossibly incompatible people (John Brown, equerry to the late Prince Albert and the widowed Queen Victoria) is riveting."
1.0,mrs_brown,"Stunning performances, stunning film. Just perfect."
1.0,mrs_brown,"A wonderful, wonderful movie. The character study of the relationship between Queen Victoria and John Brown is at once dynamic and tender."
1.0,mrs_brown,"I really enjoyed this portrayal of Queen Victoria, who by my accounts was a real square, but this movie shows some humanity to her. magnificent performance by Judi Dench and Billy Connolly is hilarious"
1.0,mrs_brown,Amazing British story. Very admirable.
1.0,mrs_brown,A very good movie about Queen Victoria.. mostly historically accurate and enjoyable
1.0,mrs_brown,Stunning performances
1.0,mrs_brown,Amazing. Billy Connolly is so under-rated as an actor! He was sweet and sensitive and portrayed John Brown well. Judi Dench was as fabulous as ever. A truly great British film!
1.0,mrs_brown,Two of the UK best actors
1.0,mrs_brown,FANTASTIC drama about Queen Victoria after Albert's death. Connolly was AWESOME here! Gerard Butler appears in this as does Antony Sher (Loki from Erik the Viking) as Disraeli. All time fav!
1.0,mrs_brown,Excellent movie! Watch it before or after watching The Queen.
1.0,mrs_brown,"YAY BILLY CONNOLLY! On another note, excellent script, story, filming, and acting."
1.0,mrs_brown,Brilliant and moving.
1.0,mrs_brown,Great story made into a great movie. The acting is fantastic.. so much so you forget they are acting. A story that makes you want to know more about these two amazingly strong individuals. This is a film not to be missed.
1.0,mrs_brown,I love this film. Dame Judi Dench and Billy Connollys performances are fantastic in telling this very moving story.
1.0,mrs_brown,"Great pair of actors, portrays the controversy of the time well."

1.0,mrs_brown,"An intrigue, no doubt"
1.0,mrs_brown,"good acting, and well, . . . (grin) I just melt at Scottish accents"
1.0,mrs_brown,"An unlikely love story where the love can never come to fruition, but is still felt between the two characters. Go see this movie if you like historical fiction or period pieces and you like good acting. This movie is what first allowed me to see Dame Judi Dench's amazing acting abilities!"
1.0,mrs_brown,A modern romantic drama starring two of the best - Dame Judi Dench and Billy Connolly as Queen Victoria and her faithful servant John Brown - they just spark off of one another.
1.0,mrs_brown,"Perfect little film, Judi Dench is probably the goddess of acting, actually. Connolly is also absolutely fantastic. Great period piece."
1.0,mrs_brown,(A chance to see Billy Connolly in the buff) :P
0.0,mrs_brown,Not gripping. I want to see more stories about the common people of this era--everything is the Queen of England this and the Queen of England that.
1.0,mrs_brown,This was a really good Movie/Story. And I like John Brown's brother :P
1.0,mrs_brown,Incrediable Movie a must see
1.0,mrs_brown,I know hardly anyone has seen this film but in my opinion this is the best performance of Judi Dench so I like to pretend she won the Oscar for this instead of that dreadful Shakespeare in Love.
1.0,mrs_brown,"Brilliant Acting all roud in this superb dramatisation of Queen Victoria, from both Judi Dench and Billy Connolly"

1.0,dave,Yes. I'm giving myself a five-star rating. I'm THAT good.
1.0,dave,My introduction to Kevin Kline. What an awesome movie. Although having someone that looks EXACTLY like the president in every way get thru life without anyone mentioning it to him PRIOR to the White House staff is a little odd.
1.0,dave,Great movie! Makes ya think...what if the average joe was president.
1.0,dave,"OH. MY. GOD. Phenomenal. Hilarious. Excellent. Pick a positive adjective and it'll describe Dave. If you haven't seen it, do. If you have, see it again. Now."

1.0,dave,"very good movie! inteligent, funny, cool..."
1.0,dave,"Washington can learn a few lessons from this great family favorite. Dave, played by Kevin Kline, is the kind of guy you don't see in politics, but wish you did. Aside from his charming personality, Dave is honest and cares about the well-being of all Americans."
1.0,dave,NÃ£o tem uma cena ruim!
1.0,dave,This movie was fantastic and I loved the hell out of this. I was sad at point and laughing my ass of at others. its a interesting story which gives you an idea of how stupid politics is. Kevin Kline seems like two different actors playing Dave and President Mitchell. Loved this movie.
1.0,dave,"Excellently written and acted, Dave is a delightful comedy."

1.0,dave,Any one can enjoy this movie. A GREAT CLASSIC!
1.0,dave,"Kevin Kline gives a surprisingly restrained performance and Sigourney Weaver is terrific. The storyline is cliched, but who cares as the movie is deigned to have you leave the theater smiling and entertained."
0.0,dave,"Highly unlikely premise. Ultimately this movie was pointless and I don't think Ms. Weaver made for a very convincing first lady. She was like, Bill Murray's girlfriend from Ghostbusters, for Christ's sake."

1.0,vertigo,"Vertigo is another proof of Hitchcock's greatness and a solid psychological thriller that never fails to shock and scare, with mesmerizing lead performances and filled with plot-twists. Rightfully considered one of the best movies ever made, this timeless classic remain unsurpassed to this day."
1.0,vertigo,"A tragic character study of dealing with death and obsession, Hitchcock's surreal magnum opus stands the test of time and should be watched by all film fanatics."
1.0,vertigo,Vertigo: Alfred Hitchcock's essentric masterpiece that dives on love and loss all while being scary and thrilling.
1.0,vertigo,"There is something special about this film, and it is mainly its unconventionally predictable as well as unexpectedly contorted subject. This movie represents many peoples idea of mystery probably in the best way ever seen on screen."
0.0,vertigo,"Hitchcock is overrated. Despite all its reviews and awards, this film is shit. The plot only relies on a single plot and twist. Though the ending was good and disturbing, as a whole it's still a POS."
1.0,vertigo,"The best Hitchcock/Stewart collaboration ever, and one of Hitchcock's finest overall. Spellbinding story, and innovative camera effects - the first time to use the simultaneous zoom in/zoom out method to elicit the sensation of vertigo."
1.0,vertigo,All I can say is ...masterpiece. perfection. iconic. If you have never experienced this film do yourself a favor and watch it immediately.
1.0,vertigo,"Hitchcock expertly tells a story about distance, the deep yearning for a connection that is too far away to obtain and is further shrouded by fears and former obligations. The viewer too feels this great longing long after the credits rolls."
1.0,vertigo,The best film of Alfred Hitchcock of all times i have never seen for my life. The music was great. I love this film and i love the music of this film
1.0,vertigo,Phenomenal. As a kid this movie frightened and entertained me like no other. Love it
1.0,vertigo,"An unpredictable, pulse-pounding, and stylish mystery about the very serious themes of love, loss and life. An absolute masterpiece coming from one of the best directors of all time, Alfred Hitchcock10/10"
1.0,vertigo,'Vertigo' has now been considered by many to be the best picture of all time. No surprises here.
1.0,vertigo,To love is to kill. Love is vertigo.
1.0,vertigo,"A confusing, unpredictable, yet beautiful film to watch, with a dark hidden message behind it. One of Hitchcock's best work and one of the best films of the 20th century."
1.0,vertigo,"Alfred Hitchcock's 'Vertigo' is the final product of excellent writing, captivating visual effects, and a story so uniquely unpredictable it will impress the viewer greatly. 5/5"
1.0,vertigo,10 out of 10:A very strange yet smart and unpredictable film that also is visually stunning.
1.0,vertigo,A very fun movie with interesting plot fueled with numerous unusual twist and turns XD
1.0,vertigo,You never go bored with Hitchcock thrillers. Brilliant in every aspect.
1.0,vertigo,"An intricate, detailed, complex story told at a pace that draws us in and allows us to savor every moment; a mesmerizing film that defies categories."
1.0,vertigo,"Possibly Alfred Hitchcock's best film. Vertigo is not meant to be taken at face value - to dismiss Vertigo as a suspense/mystery film is a crime! Every aspect of the movies is crafted to add to the dreamlike plot - color, costumes, sets, camera all add to the story."
1.0,vertigo,"Hitchcock's best film, Vertigo is a must-watch for film fans."
1.0,vertigo,Hitch's best and most complex film.
1.0,vertigo,"In my opinion, Hitchcock's best movie! Genius concept by a genius director!"
1.0,vertigo,"Smart, scary, unpredictable - Alfred Hitchcock's tale of love and murder transcends expectations due to the director's brilliant grip of suspense."
1.0,vertigo,"A technical masterpiece though the later stages of the film feel grossly misogynistic in parts, Vertigo still looks fantastic on the big screen, the abrupt ending still shocks, and that score is simply stunning."
0.0,vertigo,"So boring and outdated, not even close to being a thriller. Also there is a beautiful 25 y/o Kim Novak in this movie, what is she doing with a 50 y/o James Stewart???"
1.0,vertigo,"If the chamber of commerce were to approve a movie that included beautiful shots of their city with their museums, landmarks, and streets, and you told them it's also a dark movie about obsession, and they we're still okay with it, this would be the movie. It's a colorful movie with a great score."
1.0,vertigo,"A beautifully crafted classic. Vertigo works as a love story, works as a drama and works as a thriller all thanks to Alfred Hitchcock's directing skills. This movie literally made me cry and made me appreciate this film a lot. A perfect gem."

1.0,vertigo,Directed perfectly great acting an movie that makes you wonder about a lot
1.0,vertigo,"-IGNORE THIS ""OUT OF FIVE"" RATING4/4Hard to put into words how effective this haunting, dreamlike experiance from Hitchcock is. A unique masterpiece about a man who falls madly in love with a woman, and eventually spies on her. But what happens... Oh boy. What an experience!"
1.0,vertigo,"My personal favorite film. Vertigo's tantalizing darkness offers unique insight into the mind of its director and, to a much lesser extent, the hearts of love lorn men. Every facet of this film was rendered, and even restored, by masters of the craft."
1.0,vertigo,My personal favourite.
1.0,vertigo,"Alfred Hitchcock's most stunning achievement that define his catalogue of suspense theme. Vertigo mourns the loss of love in discomfort. It's the kind of film that repays careful attention, as almost every moment is filled with significant detail."
1.0,vertigo,Innovative camera work and dense character analysis combine to form one of Hitchcock's most Hitchcockian films.
0.0,vertigo,"Just about some creepy guy who can't take a hint and some chick who is so in need of the company of others she spends time with him. It's creepy, weird, in no way suspenseful with one of the worst endings I have ever seen!"
1.0,vertigo,"A hypnotic, beautiful, tragic love story. One of the purest examples of cinema as a window to our dreams."
1.0,vertigo,My favorite Hitchcock probably

1.0,vertigo,The Summit of Hitchcock.
1.0,vertigo,The complicated story and perfect James Stewart performance will satisfy any suspense lover.
1.0,vertigo,"Sweet, villainous, insistent, gently terrifying, and breathlessly melancholy, a wretched, sick-to-the-soul textbook for psychologically-primed filmmaking that comes uncomfortably close to something like a perfect film."
1.0,vertigo,"Surreal feeling and elusive, one of my favourite elements of Vertigo is it's hypnotic approach to direction, which takes a decent (yet ordinary) mystery and makes it seem strangely dreamlike. Combined with an outstanding script, cast and score this is easily one of the greatest thrillers ever."
1.0,vertigo,"Erotically charged and beautifully surreal, Hitchcock's Vertigo is perhaps his best film if only because the melodrama doesn't fall short of the mystery, the two are marvelously combined to create a thrilling and suspenseful mystery and a haunting meditation on love and evocation of the unearthly."
1.0,vertigo,"Vertigo is an atmospheric, thought-provoking psychological thriller that meditates on the concepts of true love and unrestrained obsession."
1.0,vertigo,Fantastic stories with great cast. Hitchcock's storytelling leads the whole industry for 40 years!

1.0,vertigo,"Hitchcock's best, most disturbing, and most moving film plays far better on repeat viewings, allowing one to ignore the private eye and thriller trappings and focus on the romantic, obsessive, emotional core."

1.0,vertigo,"On hieno mestarin duuni, mutta maailman paras elokuva? Ei nyt sentään."

1.0,vertigo,"This is the one. My favorite movie of all time. Was not quite a warm welcome to cinema back in 1958, but in time it would become Hitchcock's masterpiece. Everything from Hitch's direction to a great cast, Bernard Herrmann's score, and San Francisco's setting, Vertigo is that good."
1.0,vertigo,"hands down, vertigo is my all-time favorite film."
1.0,vertigo,"Is it the best movie ever made? Debatable. It's certainly the most artful.

1.0,vertigo,"Vertigo is bound to have you shuddering in their seat from the minute it drags you in, with a brilliant story and cinematography with typically clever motifs from Hitchcock. Even though the set reminds us of so many other Hitchcock films, it plays out like no other piece in existence."
1.0,vertigo,Did not see that coming at all. Fantastic work from the master himself. I cannot wait to explore more of his works.
1.0,vertigo,"A haunting masterpiece. A slow-burner, and not quite the usual Hitchcock suspense story; Vertigo deals with one man's obsession and personal frailty in the face of mysterious outside forces."

1.0,vertigo,This film definately requires two viewings to realise just how beautiful and yet freightening it is. the movie itself is meant to obssess us and oh how fun and scary it is to be obsessed with vertigo

1.0,vertigo,I'm speechless. Speechless. I have no speech.

1.0,vertigo,Jimmy Stewart is the man.

1.0,vertigo,A Hitchcock masterpiece.
1.0,vertigo,"Another Hitchcock classic. Stewart gives off one of his best roles as a man who, aptly, suffers from vertigo. However, it is also the audience who suffers from dizziness and confusion due to the legendary director's clever plot and visual mastery. A superb picture. Highly recommended!"

1.0,vertigo,Hitchcock's finest most beautiful moment. A genuine masterpiece and an all-time classic.
1.0,vertigo,"If the Mona Lisa is proof that colors are capable of creating blinding beauty, Vertigo is proof that the eye of a lens is just as able, the prose of human speech just as delicious as an authentic Chinese Cuisine and a man behind a machine is as dangerous as a man with a pen or brush."
1.0,vertigo,Chilling to the bone. Absolutely one of Hitchcock's best (and one of Jimmy Stewart's). Completely mesmerizing O___O

1.0,vertigo,Hitchcock's finest film and one of the most twisted and haunting love stories ever told. There hasn't been anything like it.
1.0,vertigo,"If, by the end of this movie, you look on the ground and there isn't a puddle of piss and drool, there's something wrong with you.

0.0,crying_game,Biggest pile of shit i've seen in a long time. Terrible writing that probably somehow became popular because of taboo plot points.
1.0,crying_game,A perfectly executed and original psychological thriller that serves as a frequently melodramatic essay on the unfathomable laws of desire and looseness of identity with a layered tale of sexual intrigue.

1.0,1058966-red,Few films have reached this level of artistry.
1.0,1058966-red,Th cinematography and camera angles used were very intriguing and the use of color was interesting. The color red was used to signify the important characters in the movie and to highlight important things.What a great movie and what a lovely actress. Very cute and charming.
1.0,1058966-red,Wonderful movie. Beautiful lead actress. In the UK it is called Three Colours Red. Isabel Jacob was awesome. Looks at profound subjects.
1.0,1058966-red,"Perhaps the most philosophically dense film ever made. Most of Kieslowski's films seem like puzzles to me, meant to expand mind and soul."
1.0,1058966-red,"Kieslowski and his muse Irene Jacob made some of the most beautiful, thought-provoking art in the 1990s. This one deals with voyeurism, guilt, love, and of course, fate."
1.0,1058966-red,"The way several people's lives all run parallel and intersect at one point or another is incredibly realistic and believable thanks to outstanding performances. The film is truly touching and extremely emotional, the trilogy as a whole is something really special."
1.0,1058966-red,"As the enchanting final chapter to the extraordinary Three Colors trilogy, Red is a beautiful, magnificent, complex film about life, coincidence, and connection."

1.0,1058966-red,"Awesome movie. Very symbolic, emotional, and compelling."
1.0,1058966-red,"The best of the trilogy, Three Colours: Red is a deeply-written masterwork that succeeds in its approach as it is a fully-realised and compelling recreation of Kieslowski's message."
1.0,1058966-red,"This is definitely my favorite of the trilogy. It's not as outright depressing as Bleu and not as Quirky as White. It strikes the perfect balance of heart, humor and drama in an expertly constructed masterwork. The way every trilogy should end."
1.0,1058966-red,"An excellent movie - beautiful, exquisite photograph, masterful directing, and excellent acting. Some of the filming is the best I've ever seen in a movie. In addition, the characters are great and the pacing of the story is pretty much perfect. It's a beautiful story. Great movie."
1.0,1058966-red,"quite simply perfect, a masterpiece"
1.0,1058966-red,The finest of Kieslowski's Three Colors trilogy.
1.0,1058966-red,I fell in love with Irene Jacob watching this movie and went to Geneva when I studied abroad just so I could see the city in the movie. A great movie that hits its mark and touches real emotions.
1.0,1058966-red,A highly ambitious finale to one of the great imaginative trilogies ever made.
1.0,1058966-red,"Easily the MASTERPIECE of the bunch. A perfect conclusion to a powerhouse trilogy. One feels that he has conquered the world of cinema after seeing this film. A unique and profound experience. Thank you, Kieslowski."
1.0,1058966-red,"Each entry is fantastic, but Kieslowski's ""Red"" is the masterpiece of the colors trilogy, sublime and eternally flawless."
1.0,1058966-red,Perfect. My favourite movie of all time. Beautiful.
1.0,1058966-red,A masterpiece. Flawless. I cannot express the awe: my mouth is still open.
1.0,1058966-red,"This is a masterful conclusion to the Three Colors trilogy. Beautifully crafted in every way, Red features one of the most satisfying and thought provoking endings in a film I have ever seen. What an accomplishment."
1.0,1058966-red,"Maybe the strongest film of the three, ""Red"" is a deeply philosophical exploration of chance and the inter-connectivity of life. It's searching ideas, stirring beauty, and almost humble formal virtuosity present a director at the zenith of his powers and thematic concerns."
1.0,1058966-red,"This is the final section of the late Krzysztof Kieslowski's acclaimed Three Colors trilogy (preceded by Blue and White) and in my mind, a true masterpiece."
0.0,1058966-red,I never understood the appeal of these movies.
1.0,1058966-red,A great finish to a great trilogy!
1.0,1058966-red,"Wonderful, beautiful, and engrossing. This film does no wrong."
1.0,1058966-red,Liberty! Equality! Fraternity! Recently saw the trilogy again. Found Fraternity (Rouge) to be the most compelling in today's context. A decade ago my choice was Equality (Blanc) or getting even! Maybe will take some more time to fully comprehend the value of Liberty (Bleu).
1.0,1058966-red,One of my favorite movies by Polish director Kieslowski
1.0,1058966-red,"Absolutely amazing film, the best of the three and with enough stuff in it to keep you thinking for a long time afterwards."
1.0,1058966-red,"One of the director's best (sadly his last), a touching, unsentimental but hopeful film about disconnected people who find a connection a very unlikely situation. Irene Jacob has some of the best eyes in modern movies, and Trintignant is masterfully subtle. And that opening!"
1.0,1058966-red,Definitivamente o melhor da trilogia das cores.

0.0,1058966-red,Movie fucking sucked. Don't watch/waste your time. Had to watch for my French class and hated every minute of it.
1.0,1058966-red,Beautiful. Complex and immersive. I loved it almost as much as Blue. This trilogy is on a whole different level of cinema.
1.0,1058966-red,A masterpiece by Kieslowski!

1.0,1058966-red,"One of the best films ever made, playing with reality in ways that make you look at life in a completely different light. Fitting it was Kieslowski's final and best, you must seek this out."
1.0,1058966-red,"Para mí la más hermosa de las tres, una nostálgica mirada a la inocencia, la soledad y la esperanza en el destino. D.R."

1.0,1058966-red,"What an accomplishment. Visually breathtaking and gloriously contemplative, and an ending as astonishing, if not moreso, as the two colors that came before it. Subtle."
1.0,1058966-red,C'est le destin et le hasard les themes principaux du film ou il y a beaucoup de paralleles entre differents personnes qui se rencontrent a la fin. C'est un film magnifique.
1.0,1058966-red,will watch it again for sure
1.0,1058966-red,and 5 stars is not enough...red is the best...and this is the best trilogy ever..THANK YOU KIESLOWSKI !
1.0,1058966-red,Nothing much can be said here because words are not sufficient enough. I'm so glad that Kieslowski's last film was also his masterpiece!! It was also the perfect ending to the Trilogy.
1.0,1058966-red,Perhaps my all-time favorite. Blew me away.
1.0,1058966-red,Maybe the best movie in one of the greatest trilogies of all time.
1.0,1058966-red,it was nice how all the films fell in together at the end.
1.0,1058966-red,A spellbindingly brilliant film
1.0,1058966-red,"for all those who wonder bout the word ""LOVE"" and those who thinks they know about it all. here is an insight to it painted by Krzysztof Kieslowski ."
1.0,1058966-red,Great writing/directing/acting. kept my interest throughout and had me thinking a lot about what was happening. Anytime a movie shows me something new or different its gonna rate high and this did. I think anyone can enjoy this.
1.0,1058966-red,"Loved all three, but I think blue is the most striking.It's also sad that the director passed away 2 years after making his last film."
1.0,1058966-red,äººç??ç??å·§å??å?¯ä»¥æ??å¹¾å·§å??.......
1.0,1058966-red,"Best amongst the trilogy. Intense. All in all, Colors trilogy is a must watch! Kieslowski deserved an Oscar (IMO) I'm gonna watch it all over again, undoubtedly."
1.0,1058966-red,We watched all three of Three Colors series. All three were five star movies. Kieslowski was a master. Red was my favorite. I'm glad my memory is bad because I can watch these old classics like it was the first time. They are beautiful. If you haven't seen them put them in your queue..
1.0,1058966-red,"Of the ""Trois couleurs"" films by Krzystof Kieslowski, my favorite is ""Red.' It probably has a lot to do with the great performance by Irene Jacob. The movie is so compelling, she is mesmerizing on the screen."
1.0,1058966-red,The last half-hour of this movie gave me more or less constant chills.
1.0,1058966-red,la mejor pelicula...
1.0,1058966-red,How do you medicate your loneliness?
1.0,1058966-red,"One of my favorites alongside Bleu. This is a a grownup movie, so no kiddies please."
1.0,1058966-red,"Meu preferido do Kieslowski.Ótimo roteiro, original e interessantíssimo."
1.0,1058966-red,"Everyone owns his/her little secrets. But then, everyone hides what isn't right? Not thinking in terms of consequences, but in terms of what's right to be done - this is the great thing about the end of this trilogy. Also, it is nice to see how all the pieces blend together in the end... A must see."
1.0,1058966-red,"bleu: libertad,blanc: igualdad,rouge: fraternidad."
1.0,1058966-red,"God I love this film; beautiful, simply beautiful. There is such elegance and sensuality to these three films, and in some ways it's difficult to understand what it is that makes me love them so much; rather like a great painting, I just love it, without necessarily understanding it fully."
1.0,1058966-red,Definitivamente o melhor da trilogia das cores.
1.0,1058966-red,"Brotherhood is the theme of Kieslowski's last film, and closing piece of the Three Colours Trilogy, which features a particularly extraordinary finale."
1.0,1058966-red,The concluding chapter in Kieslowski's Three Colors triology is the best. Provocative and spinning from beginning to end. A fine farewell for one of Europe's most revered film directors.
1.0,1058966-red,"Focusing on the idea of human bonding, the film contains the most beautiful cinematography compared to Blue and White. The core strength of the film lies in the fascinating interaction between the two leads. Blue and White are great, but Red is fantastic. A great end to the trilogy."
1.0,1058966-red,and Fraternity. Genius.
1.0,1058966-red,"Si BLEU es fuerza y drama, ROUGE es pasión y misterio. Irene Jacob adorable y sensacional como Valentine. Esta película me recuerda mucho aquel cuento de Jorge Luis Borges llamado ""El Otro""... Otra joyita del gran Krxyustof Kieslowski. Memorable!"
1.0,1058966-red,"Beautiful, fantastic end to a fantastic trilogy...best of the three. Doesn't try to be too clever, just does what it does, and weaves its magical tale until the viewer becomes immersed."
1.0,1058966-red,Fraternity is what keeps us sane.
1.0,1058966-red,"wonderful! way better than ""White."" Most American's will not get the point of the movie though."
1.0,1058966-red,"An absolute must-see. Possibly, one of the all times masterpieces."
1.0,1058966-red,Toda a trilogia é excepcional e merece 5 estrelas. Mas assim fica mais claro qual foi o que mais me impressionou.
1.0,1058966-red,"Wonderful conclusion to the Trois Couleurs trilogy. Irene Jacob is brilliant and Kieslowski is at his best; Red is far more accessible than Blue. Tragically, this was his last film."
1.0,1058966-red,Foreign Films are great
1.0,1058966-red,"De la trilogia de colores, esta es la favorita de los criticos (yo personalmente, me quedo con blanco). Sin embargo, esta pelicula poco a poco va penetrando el alma de la mujer de una manera que muy pocas obras cinematograficas se han atrevido (o lo han logrado)."
1.0,1058966-red,Aunque en esta estÃ¡ Irene Jacob
1.0,1058966-red,"Our lives are strings of pearls and stones. When the strings are looped by time and experience, the juxtaposition of good and bad, history and future is often painfully sweet."
1.0,1058966-red,Ce film reste Ã  mes yeux le meilleur de Kieslowski qui va Ã  travers sa camÃ©ra faire ressortir la profondeur de l'Ã¢me humaine. Ã? noter les personnages jouÃ©s par IrÃ¨ne Jacob et Jean-Louis Trintignant ainsi que la photo de ce film: un pure dÃ©lice pour les yeux et pour l'esprit !
1.0,1058966-red,Must see for anyone serious about film or art.

1.0,1058966-red,The most beautiful beginning of an End !!!xXx
1.0,1058966-red,The three separate storylines worked brilliantly and the beautiful use of red in all the appropriate places seemed perfect. The ending came as a shock.
1.0,1058966-red,"KieÅ?lowski's magnum opus. The greatest film EVER, I doubt anything will scrape thisas far as I'm concerned, on every viewing I see a little more of the genius that was Krzysztof KieÅ?lowski. How apt I should meet a Polish girl in such a fate-driven moment akin to one of his works."

0.0,1058966-red,"My stupendous guide to the Three Colours Trilogy: Three Colours Blue: Brilliant, moving. Three Colours White: Shite, boringThree Colours Red: ridiculous plot, lame characters, no 'spiritual kinship' or 'mutual redemption', just a total waste of time."
1.0,1058966-red,blue blanc rouge .... my favorite.
1.0,1058966-red,"Beautiful and redemptive. You need to see all three movies in the trilogy to fully appreciate it, though."
1.0,1058966-red,"This is true cinema. Acting, script, cinematography, music, mood, directing are all perfect. Kieslowski is one the greatest definitely."
1.0,1058966-red,One of the best movies I've watched!
1.0,1058966-red,"an unusual ending to the trilogy...Red while a masterpiece is probably my least favourite of the three...rich, complex and sensual"
1.0,1058966-red,The Trois couleurs trilogy really is great. This is extremely dense genius film-making at its best.
1.0,1058966-red,One of my all-time favorites. A kind of meditation on coincidences and larger patterns and the currents in people's lives that draw them together without their realizing it.
1.0,1058966-red,"Three Colors - my favorite films of all time. If you haven't seen them, you should."
1.0,1058966-red,"overwhelming, every detail of it. The colour Red 'Fraternite' is the apotheosis of a masterpiece."
1.0,1058966-red,"Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant end to the amazing series."
1.0,1058966-red,Made me weep inexplicably. A film that I will be thinking about for years to come.
1.0,1058966-red,"Easily the best of the trilogy, and one of the most romatic films I've ever encountered."
1.0,1058966-red,"One of Kieslowski's finest works, this should be required watching for anyone."
1.0,1058966-red,"perfectly wraps up the Three Colours, the film on its own is utter genius but along side white and blue and complete masterpiece of film making"
1.0,1058966-red,"A masterpiece. After watching it again you realise how deeply layered and complex it all is, but it's all carried off very in a very simple fashion."
1.0,1058966-red,My second favorite film in the trilogy. An excellent film
1.0,1058966-red,"I found the movie to be truly moving. It was sad, yet hope still existed at the end. I loved Irene Jacob in this film. I look forward to the other two."

1.0,1058966-red,Simply a masterpiece!
1.0,1058966-red,"Beautiful, character-driven film that looks inside the soul of humankind and asks some very basic, but abstract questions. Not as good as Blue, but better than White. I liked the tie-up at the end."
1.0,1058966-red,"The best of the three ... and that's saying a lot. Plus there's Irene Jacob. And the runway scene. ""Etre""."
1.0,1058966-red,"magnificent example of how films should be made...real cinema as art. a truly breathtaking conclusion to the trilogy, not sure about rating them separately..."
1.0,1058966-red,"veo el destino por doquier, hasta en le pelicula rojo lo vi.Conexiones imfinitas, posibilidades infinitas"
1.0,1058966-red,"Kieslowski takes the concepts of fate, conscience, and brotherhood and weaves them into a unique and powerful story filled with gorgeous imagery. The end just always makes me marvel at his genius. Too bad we don't have more from him."
1.0,1058966-red,"Although I know it is part three in a trilogy of films, I watched this one first because it was recommended to me by a good friend. I really really liked this film, and the strange thing is, I can't tell why."
1.0,1058966-red,"To sum up the briiliance of Kieslowski's career, one needs only to watch this film. Kieslowski is a filmmaker of compassion and meditation. Not for anyone who doesn't go to the cinema to think."
1.0,1058966-red,by far the best of the three colours. a beautiful film.

1.0,1058966-red,"the finale of the greatest trilogy, ever.... ties together ""blue"" and ""white"", which were all filmed concurrently and are 5-star films on their own.... all 3 films are beautiful masterpieces in exploring the interaction between personalities and consequences of their actions...."

1.0,1058966-red,My favorite 'Three Colors' part. The two main characters are well written and the acting is amazingly subtle. One of those quiet movies that simple minds will never get. Everyone else should definitely check it out!
1.0,1058966-red,Part of a series. I loved this movie as much as Bleu. Irene Jacob is wonderful.
1.0,1058966-red,The best of the three films. It has wonderful images throughout. Must see again.
1.0,1058966-red,I love all Kieslowski but this one is the best
1.0,1058966-red,"Final sublime para la trilogia de Kieslowsi, con una reflexion sobre la forma en que se entrelazan los destinos de los seres humanos. Una pelicula cargada de simbolos, el mas bonito : la mirada de Valentine (Irene Jacob) en la toma final."
1.0,1058966-red,Kieslowski is a great Director and this is a perfect final film. Irene Jacob is outstanding and the film is pretty much flawless in every way. It's not essential to have seen 'blue' and 'white' first but the characters from the previous films do appear in 'Red'.
1.0,1058966-red,Amazing... an all time favourite. Must see White and Blue as well.
1.0,1058966-red,Paras kolmesta. Erittain tiivis ja kaunis elokuva kohtalosta. Irene Jacob hohtaa kuten myos melkein kaikki kuvat maagista valoa. Yksi parhaimmista nakemistani elokuvista.
1.0,1058966-red,One of my all time favorite films... a true masterpiece
1.0,1058966-red,"Last film in the 3 Colours Trilogy, with scenes from White and Blue cleverly cut in to bring everything together."
1.0,1058966-red,"The last and most mature film of the director. Scene setting and sctors are wonderful. The same meaning of ""Doulbe life of Veronique"" applies to the old & young judges."

1.0,1058966-red,"watch all 3, but watch them in order. Superb"
1.0,1058966-red,The best movie i have ever seen!!!!
1.0,1058966-red,"Ravishing is the first word that comes to mind with Kieslowski's last effort, coupled with Irene Jacob's stunning looks & performance! ...and Jean-Louie Trintignant's still shines as a matinee idol in winter!"
1.0,1058966-red,This movie is incdredible! Such a wonderful movie about character development and friendship
1.0,1058966-red,"I know, all flixster (77%) didn't like it. But I like it. It is one of my favorite film for all time. It enlighten me through trilogies conclusion. I got the inner feeling of french revolution."
1.0,1058966-red,One of my favourite movies of all times. Irene Jacob is so stunningly beautiful and melancholic at the same time. The music is superb. The story captivates. Visually it is a feast of light. I really need to get it on Blue Ray to see it again.

1.0,1058966-red,"Perhaps the least intoxicating of the trilogy, but my personal favorite. Deep."

1.0,1058966-red,"Slutet på triologin håller samma höga klass som början den blå). Perfekt i alla delar - musik, kamera, dialog - och speciellt tankeväckande för en gammal domare!"
1.0,1058966-red,Irene Jacob is beautiful in a way you can't see until the end of the movie. The details of Bleu (et Blanc) become clearer. Kieslowski is my favorite director because of this movie and how it crowns the prior two in this series. A good watch for a relaxing afternoon without distractions.
1.0,1058966-red,A masterful ending to this genuine work
1.0,1058966-red,the most surreal of the three...voyeuristic...verra noice.
1.0,1058966-red,Kieslowski ends the trilogy well.
1.0,1058966-red,A fitting ending to an excellent film trilogy. The ending left me completely speechless.
1.0,1058966-red,The best Kieslowski's movie
1.0,1058966-red,Kieslowski fills up my spiritual space that's been emptied for so long
1.0,1058966-red,"The only part of the trilogy that matters. People do not understand this movie. The musical score, cinematography, etc. are not what's important...what's so profound about that? watch it again, and focus on the theme"
1.0,1058966-red,"Emociones fuertes, con inocencia y alegria mezcladas con el destape de pasiones humanas menos nobles. Confianza en el futuro y amor a los demas Kieslowski es un maestro"
1.0,1058966-red,"The best film in the world! Amour, hasard, silences, emotions... et la couleur rouge!"
1.0,1058966-red,"It left me speechless! So powerful, so mysterious, so romantic (in the literal sense of the word) and achieves what I thought only literature can."
1.0,1058966-red,Will probably need a second viewing but rivals Blue as being one of the best of the trilogy!!!
1.0,1058966-red,I love Kieslowski so much. He is great.
1.0,1058966-red,One of the best movies i have seen in a long time
1.0,1058966-red,I fell in love with Irene Jacob watching this movie and went to Geneva when I studied abroad just so I could see the city in the movie. A great movie that hits its mark and touches real emotions.
1.0,1058966-red,"It plays on my senses but most of all touches my soul. But I will have to say that ""Blue"" is my favourite of this trilogy. All of them are remarkable."
1.0,1058966-red,Did not know that Krzysztof Kieslowski was directing two of 'Three Colours' at the same time!!!
1.0,1058966-red,Kieslowski pÃ¥ sitt beste! Helt pÃ¥ hÃ¸yde med Veronikas to liv (og det sier ganske mye)

1.0,1058966-red,ROUGE is definitely the best part of the Trois Couleurs trilogy. (And this is my favorite foreign movie.)
1.0,1058966-red,"Beautiful, quiet, and delicately rendered meditation on the mysteries and meaning of love."
1.0,1058966-red,"Pure Genius, no film has had a greater effect on me than this, Kieslowski is an unsung hero, the film is beautifully shot, wonderfully poetic and features a fantastic music score, this movie still sends tingles down my spine and i've seen it many times."
1.0,1058966-red,"Honestly, I've seen a lot of movies, & I think this is the greatest ever..."

1.0,1058966-red,Thoughly enjoyed it.
1.0,1058966-red,"Best in the trilogy. Blue and White are both very good, but Red definitely trumps them."
1.0,1058966-red,"Amongst the Three Colors, I like Rouge (Red) most. Maybe I believe Irene Jocob is the best actress for Kieslowski's Movies."
1.0,1058966-red,The most beautiful film making I have ever seen.
1.0,1058966-red,"""I feel something important is happening around me. And it scares me. """
1.0,1058966-red,C'est le destin et le hasard les themes principaux du film ou il y a beaucoup de paralleles entre differents personnes qui se rencontrent a la fin. C'est un film magnifique.
1.0,1058966-red,Another of Kieslowski's great films. Great music.
1.0,1058966-red,Kieslowski my favorite directors (of course he is polish - pardon he was). His movies are like poetry you are just reading them on big screen. 'Red' is my favorite one from the trilogy. To pity that he didn't finish his last project 'Heaven' i felt to lack him
1.0,1058966-red,"Think in details The memory , the crash."
1.0,1058966-red,One of my favorite movies. Third in a trio of movies.
1.0,1058966-red,"My fav color out of the Trois couleurs. But music wise, Bleu is the best."
1.0,1058966-red,The perfect finale to the trilogy.
1.0,1058966-red,This ranks amongst my all time favorite! I love the way color and emotions are intertwined in this trilogy. This is a touching story of how nothing is a coincidence in life and that there is a greater plan that we are all a part of.
1.0,1058966-red,"The one that brings it all, expertly, together - blessing some characters and granting them another chance. Not as good as Blue - but then few things are."
1.0,1058966-red,"it took me a while to figure out what was happening. but, this has got to be one of the most beautiful films"
1.0,1058966-red,Great cinematography. Simple but effective story. Subtle and beautiful.

1.0,1058966-red,Almost 14 years after first seeing this in Georgetown I still think it's one of the best films ever made. Reviewing it reprises one of the roles.
1.0,1058966-red,The greatest cinematic story about fate. The way everything wraps up is simply genius.
1.0,1058966-red,I totally agree with Gustavo (even tough I only understood Kieslowski is an genious...)
1.0,1058966-red,A fantastic end of the three colors

1.0,1058966-red,My favorite of the trilogy! Loved the way the ending ties all three together!
1.0,1058966-red,Love anything by Kieslowski. I cried the morning when they announced he died of a heart attack.

1.0,1058966-red,My second favourite foreign film ever after Hana-bi.
1.0,1058966-red,So Poetic and real in a sense!
1.0,1058966-red,"The world is getting smaller, yet the gap between people grow wider. This film captures the distance in between. In the end, we are all tragic beings on a boat destined to sink; one person's tragedy is everybody's tragedy."
1.0,1058966-red,My favourite of the trilogy.
1.0,1058966-red,"A film about loneliness and isolation and escaping it. So subtle, so real, but it has a happy ending!!!"
1.0,1058966-red,The best of the three.
1.0,1058966-red,"Watch Red, watch Blue, Watch White ... Kieslowski - absolutely vintage"
1.0,1058966-red,A complex and meticulous masterpiece.
1.0,1058966-red,My absolute favorite movie
1.0,1058966-red,My favorite of the Kieslowski trilogy... What if?
1.0,1058966-red,"this is one of those movies that i fell madly in love with when i was younger and sappier because i thought that it told me real, tangible truths about human interactions. I still really love it."
1.0,1058966-red,"Un homme et une femme, fin bref. Jean-Louis Trintignant collecte des pierres. Ce soir Ã  la tÃ©lÃ©"
1.0,1058966-red,The cut that Jacob has a pear brandy with Trintignant is one of the most beautiful scene I have ever seen.
1.0,1058966-red,"Powerful, unique relation between 2 characters; my favourite from the trilogy"
1.0,1058966-red,Kieslowski is the man.
1.0,1058966-red,The cinematography and framing of the shots is amongst the best of any film I've ever seen. Great story telling and one of my favorite films of all time.
1.0,1058966-red,The most accessible and warm installment of Kieslowski's Three Colors trilogy (after a little initial discomfort in a specific plot point surround Trintignant's creepy but compelling character as a disillusioned eavesdropping judge). Irene Jacob is RADIANT here.
1.0,1058966-red,A great piece of art. I like the way this is connected to the other colors. Music served the visuals amazingly well.
1.0,1058966-red,The best of the greatest trilogy of all times. Trintignant is astonishing. Pure Art.
1.0,1058966-red,eso si es una rara joya
1.0,1058966-red,Kieslowski was a genius--a word that many undeserving are attributed with; but not here--and this is his magnum opus.
1.0,1058966-red,"The best, the don't need more words"
1.0,1058966-red,"a wonderful end to the most beautiful trilogy ever made. Red is, as Roger Ebert says, the best amoung equals. It is the best, but they're all brilliant, watch them in order: Blue, White and Red (on favorites to represent trilogy, not individual film)"
1.0,1058966-red,Seen it a long time ago!
1.0,1058966-red,"This is one of the three films in an amazing trilogy. It's story is solid, but to me...unremarkable. However, the colors are absolutely brilliant. The cinematography is so singular and special."
1.0,1058966-red,"Part of the greatest sequence of films ever made. Bleu is the masterpiece but this is not far behind. Irene Jacob befriends an old judge, and they begin an unusual relationship."
1.0,1058966-red,Last of the trilogy and the best of the three in my opinion.
1.0,1058966-red,De las mejores pelÃ­culas que he visto.
1.0,1058966-red,"If you love movies, you should see this. Especially the cinematography."
1.0,1058966-red,well.. no words exist that would accurately describe this masterpiece

1.0,1058966-red,Beautifully stunning
1.0,1058966-red,"por una historia, que no esta en el film, pero es la principal"
1.0,1058966-red,"An amazing movie. Not only was the directing and acting wonderful, but the cinematography was beautiful. One of those cathartic movies that you can't help but cry during."
1.0,1058966-red,"Not as good as the blue, but still totally amazing."
1.0,1058966-red,"Georgous movie, visually stunning. In my Top 10 all time and one of my most viewed."
1.0,1058966-red,"Master storytelling, dealing with life, fate, and destiny. This is the film in which composition heavily reflects the film's themes and motifs."
1.0,1058966-red,"even though the entire trilogy is absolutely amazing, this one is the best one."
1.0,1058966-red,"I like it! my favorite one among ""three colors."" KK is amazing~~"
1.0,1058966-red,My favourite movie by far. Krzysztof Kieslowski's best film.
1.0,1058966-red,Good - a bit different
1.0,1058966-red,A lovely and delicate end to the trilogy that will fill your heart with hope... Simply stunning...
1.0,1058966-red,"the film that hooked me onto Kieslowski; stunning film about the beauty of friendship, between and old judge and valentine (a model); there is a parallel story that brings forth the circularity of life."
1.0,1058966-red,"i'm really impressed by krysztof's last film! perfect length an hour and a half, good storyline, human relationship well portrayed, cinemathique, ... what can i complain about? nothing at all !"
1.0,1058966-red,serinin uc filmi de ayri ayri tattalar. ortak gosterilen kahramanlar olaya ayri bir guzellik katmis. muzikler ve kurgu da mukemmel. en begendigim seri diyebilirim.

1.0,1058966-red,soeachless when it comes to this series of films.. the pychology.. the emotions.. wow
1.0,1058966-red,"i fall in love with Irene Jacob after i watch it, what a girl!! although u cant control destiny, but there's always hope!"
1.0,1058966-red,"This is a beautifully subtle love story, with mysterious and enigmatic superimposed human stories. The relationship between Valentine and the retired judge is extraordinarily moving."
1.0,1058966-red,"A retired judge... or God in the bench? Rita, a dog. The door is open. A judge hearing the phone convesations. Valentine has faith in the old judge. She can't see him, because of the lights of flashes, but she hear him. The judge in the bench. And then... fate or Providence?"
1.0,1058966-red,Tämä taitaa jäädä lopulliseksi suosikikseni trilogiasta.
1.0,1058966-red,I'm so totally in love with Valentine/Irène Jacob... I'm so totally amazed by the judge/Jean-Louis Trintignant... I'm so totally fond of Kieslowski's last period...
1.0,1058966-red,A movie that means a lot to me.
1.0,1058966-red,One of these movies that can' be surpassed
1.0,1058966-red,fucking magical. kieslowski is everything that kubrick wished he could be.
1.0,1058966-red,"Incredible! This is the most intelligent film I've ever seen. Subtle, emotional, mysterious, and thought-provoking. Definitely takes more than one watch to ""get it"" and makes movies like ""The Notebook"" look so stupid in comparison. A sublime masterpiece!"
1.0,1058966-red,One of my Top 10 Favorites.
1.0,1058966-red,A masterpiece of cinema but it might take more than one viewing (of the entire trilogy) to be able to appreciate KK. If someone like Blake or Da Vinci made a movie this would be it. I am in love with Irene Jacob.
1.0,1058966-red,"Perfect. The story, the characters, the technics..."
1.0,1058966-red,My favourite movie of all time!!!
1.0,1058966-red,An incredible series by Kieslowski...I could watch all three of these on any given day.
1.0,1058966-red,One my favorite films ever!
1.0,1058966-red,I wish Krysztof Kieslowski were still alive to make these kinds of movies.
1.0,1058966-red,"The Three Colors: Blue, White and Red combined are the best"
1.0,1058966-red,Kieslowski's trilogy is just perfect. Can't say which of the films I like the most.
1.0,1058966-red,"... Why is he dead? That's a big waste. Piesewicz is still here, but it's not the same"
1.0,1058966-red,One of the all time greats. Valentine is the character for all ages.
1.0,1058966-red,Amazing performances. My stomach and heart were in knots as the movie progressed. Full of humanity and beautifully executed.
1.0,1058966-red,Vidunderlig! Maravillosa! Wonderfull!
1.0,1058966-red,Like a Maupassant story...unfolding its secrets over many viewings.
1.0,1058966-red,"Irene Jacob is stunning in this movie, and with all the layers of meaning this movie must be watched and rewatched by all moviegoers."
1.0,1058966-red,The best of out of a masterful trilogy.
1.0,1058966-red,"Punainen pÃ¤Ã¤ttÃ¤Ã¤ vÃ¤ritrilogian, mutta on myÃ¶s erillisenÃ¤ elokuvana loistokas. Oikeastaan koko trilogia on tyyliltÃ¤Ã¤n puhdasta minimalismia ja tunnelma pidÃ¤ttÃ¤ytynyttÃ¤. Jokaista asiaa ei siis katsojalle suoraan kerrota, vaan kyse on pÃ¤Ã¤ttelystÃ¤ ja tulkinnasta. TÃ¤mÃ¤ sopii makuuni."
1.0,1058966-red,"My absolute favorite of the Trois Couleurs trilogy, one of my favorite films. The cover is simple genius! I don't think I can watch this ""too many"" times. There are so many links to the other btwo films of the trilogy: the old lady trying to recycle the glass, the final scene ..."
1.0,1058966-red,PERHAPS THE BEST OF THE TRILOGY...
0.0,1058966-red,I didn't like the acting or characters and thought that it tried to understand despair from an idealistic standpoint. Not much gained by watching this film.
1.0,1058966-red,"great ending. dancing with fate, humanity etc. another graet drama by kieslowski"
1.0,1058966-red,"La trilogie est a voir - les trois films sont extraordinaires mais en plus, ils sont liÃ©s. Chaque film comprend une petite partie d'un autre."
1.0,1058966-red,"If you don't like this, you are DEAD INSIDE. That is all."
1.0,1058966-red,Irene Jacob...so many talents outside of the U.S. that we can discover if we only took the time to look. Kieslowski outdoes himself. I loved Trintignant's character...The phone tapping and how it was handled was superb.
1.0,1058966-red,"A stunning film, Kieslowski proves himself yet again."
1.0,1058966-red,One of my all time favourites!

1.0,1058966-red,"the final note in kieslowski's symphony of a trilogy. watching the trilogy in order blew me away. Rouge was the highlight, and also kieslowski's most personal film ever. passionate and complex, the film and the trilogy haunt me for days! the crowning achievement in ALL of kieslowski's works!"
1.0,1058966-red,"Perfection. Leading you inexorably to the complex mesh of emotions that are finally captured and then concluded, in a single image, masterly. It matches and then it exceeds the coda of Blue."
1.0,1058966-red,"perfecta, el colorido es hermoso. los tres colores se unen en sus personajes"
1.0,1058966-red,uuuuuuuh french movies...
1.0,1058966-red,The end of the best Trilogy from my favorite director.
1.0,1058966-red,"Beautiful, but you must watch all three movies; blue, white and then red to appreciate them"
1.0,1058966-red,"I consider the three as one, but the app doesn't, and I couldn't find white, which is my real favourite, so there you go."

1.0,1058966-red,I love this film: has a lot of very heartwarming moments and a lot of alienation and animosity but the overall spirit of the film is optomstic with a happy ending for all. I think the location of Geneva is instrumental to the film's ethos.

1.0,sunrise,"Stylistically, it's about the greatest achievement of the silent era and deserves to be re-watched over and over again. But this film is so great because of the two lead performances and their love story. After all, it could happen at any moment in any time. Simple and beautiful."

1.0,sunrise,"Quite simply beautiful. One of very few honest and poignant true love stories in cinema. It is very slow paced but highly worthwhile for its moments of romance, humour, tragedy and beauty. Murnau created a timeless silent film that stands up as perhaps one of the greatest films ever made."

1.0,sunrise,Amazing... Murnau was really genius... Got the French Blu-Ray and it is terrific!

1.0,sunrise,"incredible, seamless fluctuation between light and dark with some of the most brilliant twists i've ever seen"
1.0,sunrise,"F.W. Murnau directed Sunrise (sometimes subtitled ""A Song of Two Humans""), an immensely moving, gorgeous film. Considered by many to be one of the greatest silent films of all time, Sunrise is more than a film; it is an experience. Cinematically revolutionary, and absolutely beautiful."
1.0,sunrise,Never thought that I would watch a 1927 movie and be amused by it ... Impressive
1.0,sunrise,"This is probably the most beautiful silent film I've ever seen. Its poetic in it's story of love regained, heartbreakingly tragic by its finale, breathtaking in its cinematography, and powerful from start to finish.I'm glad it had a happy ending. Its been a long time since I've so rooted for one."
1.0,sunrise,"This is a breathtaking film, made in 1927, the last year of silent films. The visuals, cinematography and acting could be carried over to any other decade and still survive the harsh depreciation of being as modern as it was when it was first released."

1.0,sunrise,While I always preferred Frtiz Lang to F.W. Murnau this is a masterpiece that's both moving and fun to watch. Definitely one of the best love stories ever put on film with a tiny hint of very early film noir (early in the film)
1.0,sunrise,"One of the greatest testaments to the power of silent cinema. F. W. Murnau's sublime wordless weepie transcends crowd-pleasing melodrama into high art, luminous poetry and a virtuous moral fable. This is, arguably, the Citizen Kane of the silent era."

1.0,sunrise,One of the greatest dramas-love stories ever and I think it's the first of its kind. Murnau used all the technics of his time and made a masterpiece. Also the man (George O' Brien) and the woman (Janet Gaynor) were the ideal actors and were great.
1.0,sunrise,"Hadn't seen this one for years, and I should have. Its fabulous."

Fantastic, love the tram scene and the walk through the city. I feel an Americanism coming on ""Awesome"". Murnau, wow"
1.0,sunrise,An amazing film for it technical ingenuity and depth of emotion. Unfortunately the story is elliptical and without strong structure. It's more about watching and experiencing then intellectual thought. For it's time its a masterpiece

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,Wonderful film. I have seen it twice and look forward to watching it again. The sweet way that Charlie falls for Rose is something that only two wonderful actors can portray. The scene where Bogart imitates the hippos and makes her laugh is adorable. The wedding is unforgettable.

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"John Huston filmed his World War I epic on location, which was an unusual decision at the time, but the grittiness and festering of the jungle perfectly matches the griminess of our main characters, played by Bogart and Hepburn."

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"The 1951 classic that won Humphrey Bogart an Oscar and inspired the Jungle Cruise at Disneyland was every bit as awesome as I had pictured it. The special effects are definitely of their time, but that doesn't stop it from being a timeless film."
1.0,the_african_queen_1951,The first of a series of boy meets girl and they take on the world. Once again a classic movie with two of the greatest actors to ever live. Joe versus the Volcano might be said to be a take off of AQ. Very loosely. Same struggles different picture.

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"This is my favorite Huston film. Bogie and Hepby (new nickname I made up for her) are perfect together in this film. The on-screen chemistry is undeniable and helps sell the film, which is a fairly straightforward love story when all is said and done. Loved it to death."

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"The relationship between Bogey and Hepburn is marvelous, as they first despise each other and then long for one another. Charlie Alnut is one of cinema's best characters, often overshadowed by Bogey's own Fred C. Dobbs. A trek well-worth the taking."
1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"There are a couple stars in each generation that steal our hearts so completely we'll watch anything they're in. Bogey and Kate are both such stars, and to see them together in a well-made (John Huston) film is a delight worth savoring again and again."

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"Two all time greats at their best! You just can't fault this film. When you consider Hepbirn and Bogart take 95% of the screen time and keep your interest, it truly is remarkable. They are trying to outwit the Germans travelling up river in Africa in a derelect boat. Enthralling viewing!"
1.0,the_african_queen_1951,Not a lot of true five-star movies out there. But this is one of 'em. How is it that nobody's ever remade this? Harrison Ford would be a great Charlie Allnut.

Good love story for the girls, and enough action to keep a guy from squirming too much.One small compliant, I would have drowned Hepburn when she dumped the first bottle of gin overboard, but that's just a personal reaction. A definite classic!"
1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"One of my favs... for me this film is a clever metaphor for marriage. It is a poignant and smart story about negotiation, disguised as a trivial comedy. Just lovely!"

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,one of my many favorite movie
1.0,the_african_queen_1951,One of my all time favourites! The chemistry between Bogart and Hepburn is indescribable.

1.0,lost_in_translation,"The chemistry between Murray and Johansson is dynamite, but not in a sexy time way, but in understanding each other. It was moving. My jaded heart felt something, and I'm still trying to determine what that feeling is."
1.0,lost_in_translation,Want to see this one again.

1.0,lost_in_translation,"Watched this again after ten years and it still has the ability to instantly charm you with its blend of humour, poignancy and bat-crazy Tokyo culture. As for Bill Murray, well, I award him another five stars."

1.0,lost_in_translation,"A poignant, sad tale that finds a harmony between comedy and complex despair."
1.0,lost_in_translation,"I've told myself that this film is the film that speaks to me the most. It has a very quiet message, told in a very calm way. I worship Sofia Coppola for this film alone."
1.0,lost_in_translation,"Propelled by Sofia Coppola's smart, original screenplay and Bill Murray's perfectly understated performance, Lost In Translation delivers a unique and moving story about romance and friendship that subtly evokes emotion."
1.0,lost_in_translation,"If I told you Bill Murray could play a character so subtle and sentimental, that the comedy of the film strengthens the films overall artwork, it would be hard to believe. But it has been done. Scarlett Johansson was also phenomenal, and it was a shame she wasn't nominated for an Oscar."
1.0,lost_in_translation,One of three movies I've seen more than once. Actually more than ten times as of 2013. My number one.

1.0,lost_in_translation,She'll probably never top this or Virgin Suicides.
1.0,lost_in_translation,"Second viewing nearly a decade later, and I find it difficult to express how this film resonates with me. A story about unrequited attraction/love that is a film of contradictions; funny, melancholic, bittersweet, wistful, serious. Its power and pathos cannot be understated."
1.0,lost_in_translation,Amazing film. A great mix of comedy and drama. My No1 Film.
0.0,lost_in_translation,"Boring. Not Bill Murrays finest, not even mediocre."
1.0,lost_in_translation,"One of my favorite films of all time. Between Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanson's fantastic performances, the vibrant visual style and soundtrack, and Sofia Coppola's character/dialogue-driven script, this movie is simply terrific."

0.0,lost_in_translation,"I don't see it the message that is. I always find it hard to really be moved or touched by western Drama, Their sadness, the grief process & how they handle themselves at hard times is something I'll never relate to at all !!"
1.0,lost_in_translation,"A subtle, slow, low budget film that accomplishes its aims and really connects with the audience. Sometimes life's choices lead one into a present that is muddled and lacking in significance. Doing whiskey commercials in Japan is about as lost as one can get."
1.0,lost_in_translation,"Absolutely phenomenal, It honestly had an impact me, I really like bill murray's acting it was amazing! I also really enjoyed Scarlett Johanson in it as well! A movie I would highly recommend!"
1.0,lost_in_translation,Great movie with a hipster vibe. Bill Murray!
1.0,lost_in_translation,"I love this film. It's just beautiful in every aspect. The fact it's a love story without sex and without anyone actually saying ""I love you"" is what makes it work as well as it does. I would definitely put this in my top ten favorite films."

0.0,lost_in_translation,To this day I have never understood what the critics and some people have loved about this film. What's it even about? Bill Murray gets creepy and tries to start something with Scarlett Johanssen in Japan? Avoid this stinker.

1.0,lost_in_translation,"Sophia Coppola's best film is also the most artistic film by her. By using the surreal setting of Tokyo, we go through a journey through both the physical and mental states of our two protagonists.

1.0,lost_in_translation,Sofia Coppola's films just seem more real to me with how they are filmed and how emotion is portrayed. Bill Murray is definitely a man of many talents. Great Film.

1.0,talk_to_her,"Every bit as good as Y Tu Mama Tambien, Almodovar's beautifully crafted story has a sensibility and resemblance to Dostoefsky in the form of tragic metaphor.

1.0,talk_to_her,"A piece of work that strike the center of the soul: What is love and what if, a weird kind of it? A romantic masterpiece, just not quite an ordinary one. Unique piece of sentiment that might get you touched, disgusted and suprised at the same time. Almodovar is an absolute genius."
1.0,talk_to_her,beautiful art by a great passionate director. with a lot of wonderful music...
1.0,talk_to_her,UNA DE MIS FAVORITAS DE ALMODOVAR
1.0,talk_to_her,"I've seen this film! Great great story line..great drama, great actors n actresses!!"
1.0,talk_to_her,Raping coma victims is never a good idea. Almodovar explores the concept of love and toys with our perception of the criminal.
1.0,talk_to_her,Striking rendition of beauty that grows from tragedy.
1.0,talk_to_her,Love Almodovar's style. Very good movie.
1.0,talk_to_her,"Imagintive, subtle, beautiful and intelligently written."
1.0,talk_to_her,"Almodovar is Almodovar, nothing to add. :}"
1.0,talk_to_her,The best Almodovar movie.
1.0,talk_to_her,"It's an effective piece of art which has an interesting and original inner voice. It's thought-provoking. Masterpiece that engages you intellectually and leaves you awakened, intrigued and excited."
1.0,talk_to_her,"Magnificent. All of Almodovar's pet interests come together beautifully in this movie - odd sexuality, lovely garish decor and costumes, films within films. I don't know of any other director who could have pulled this off - or who would have wanted to. I don't know if he'll ever top this one."
1.0,talk_to_her,one of the best Almodóvar movies.
1.0,talk_to_her,"This is a great movie from Almodovar, with slightly different style from all his other films. Almodovar's films always have the element of murder, gay, and transexual. However, Talk to her is different. It's about loneliness, passion of love and selflessness. I love it!"
1.0,talk_to_her,"Une mise en image parfaite, une musique ""chair de poule"", une vision perturbante de l'amour et un Ã©trange cocktail d'Ã©motions. AdorÃ© !"

1.0,talk_to_her,"This is another one of my favorite films. It is quirkey, tragic and fun and best of all it blurs the line between reality and fantasy."
1.0,talk_to_her,"The apparent amorality in Almodóvar's work can be deceiving, and this is the best example. His refusal to to portray so-called monsters as such allows a clearer glimpse at what is, to me, his most transgressive characteristic: a bold, radically humanistic approach to character. His best work so far."
1.0,talk_to_her,"Depressing, sick, and wrong - and I loved every minute of it."
1.0,talk_to_her,i'm still crying. uau.
1.0,talk_to_her,Almodovar at his finest! A really touching movie with a nice flow and script.

0.0,talk_to_her,"I really enjoyed bits and pieces of the film, but as a whole it doesn't add up to anything spectacular except maybe a jumbled mess.

1.0,the_big_sick,Really good. Kumail Nanjiani the pakistani guy from Silicon Valley tells a real life story about the white girl he's dating getting cancer and the struggle of an interracial/cross-cultural partnership.

1.0,the_big_sick,A good feel-good after some time
1.0,the_big_sick,"A cultural commentary, a treatise on love, and a refreshing look at tenderness. You may cry a tear or two, but the smiles provide a refreshing balance.

1.0,her,Absolutely beautiful.
1.0,her,Graceful and stylish; Jonze's sharp commentary about connectivity manages to turn its science fiction set-up into awareness about isolation. Her is a modern jewel that only promises to get better with time.
1.0,her,"Great show. Watched on AA137 DFW-HKG Aug 24, 2014. Joaquin Phoenix is great, and whichever German actress played the voice if the OS is seriously sexy, at least as far as her voice is concerned."

1.0,waitress,A beautiful film! Genuine characters with real life touch!
1.0,waitress,"One of my favorite movies because it shows that two different people can have something nice happen out of the bad. I really love Andy Griffith in it, because the only character that I really know him as is who he played in the Andy Griffith Show."

1.0,to_catch_a_thief,Ironically Grace Kelly became the princess of this region. Its crisp cinematography made her shine
1.0,to_catch_a_thief,Another great Hitchcock film. I really like Cary Grant in roles like this. I was very surprised by how much French was spoken and not subtitled in this.
1.0,to_catch_a_thief,One of my favourite....pure classic

1.0,heavenly_creatures,Absolutely compelling movie.
1.0,heavenly_creatures,"Slick, tense, and utterly spellbinding; 'Heavenly Creatures' is a fantastic display of Peter Jackson's talent and versatility, as well as the acting talents of Kate Winslet and the criminally underrated Melanie Lynskey."
1.0,heavenly_creatures,A beautiful film. Great performances
1.0,heavenly_creatures,An oldie from Peter Jackson but still a great watch. The true story of 2 school girls who plan to kill one of their mothers. Visually superb and the acting of a young Winslet and Lynsky is so good. An odd story but well worth a watch
1.0,heavenly_creatures,True stories are always great and these two actresses did a good job and yet so young that its hard to see them look like how they aged now.
1.0,heavenly_creatures,The best movie I have ever seen. It changed the way I thought about everything and I still get chills today after my first viewing in 2008.
1.0,heavenly_creatures,"Well, I thought this movie was very unique, and cool. I like how the movie was made with the far out fantasy scenes when when they wanna be in a different world. Kate Winslet nailed this movie. Both Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynsky are really talented"
1.0,heavenly_creatures,"'Heavenly Creatures' is a wonderful movie that has impressive visual effects, a great performance by Kate Winslet and a shocking conclusion that you won't see coming."
1.0,heavenly_creatures,"It's stylish, weird, raw, beautifully written, acted and directed, wich makes it another masterpiece from director Peter Jackson."
1.0,heavenly_creatures,A Good film with two excellent actresses and a genius as director.
1.0,heavenly_creatures,"Its Peter Jackson's answear to the kind of unapologitic true stories of Sidney Lumet, and it flows like a great Greek tragedy: the characters ambigous, the intensity never lets up, and the inevitable conclusion is heart breaking."
1.0,heavenly_creatures,"kate's 1st movie, i know its unconventional, but the editing was really good, same with the effects and direction of peter jackson."

1.0,heavenly_creatures,One of the most captivating films I've ever seen.
1.0,heavenly_creatures,Beyond fun on such a demented scale and completely mind-bending as far as bio pic's go. Heavenly Creatures is a history lesson for filmgeeks that in many ways surpasses even DEAD ALIVE to ultimately be what I would consider PETER JACKSON'S MASTERPIECE.
1.0,heavenly_creatures,"Great story. This a true surprise coming from Peter Jackson, that tends to avoid having style to ensure a good enough concept is well told."
1.0,heavenly_creatures,emotionally draining stuff. A must see

1.0,heavenly_creatures,one of Jackson's best. and it's Kate's first film.
1.0,heavenly_creatures,"Wow, this film is utterly mesmorising from start to finish. The ending is extremely shocking and very hard to watch. It actually made me cry. I wasn't all that keen on the fantasy elements, but they don't intrude too much to spoil your enjoyment."
0.0,heavenly_creatures,No way it was awful! And wtf this is not sci fi fantasy???
1.0,heavenly_creatures,"I just love how crazy these two are together and the way Peter Jackson shows us their demented world. The thing that amazed me most is that even after the terrible thing they did, I felt somewhat sorry for this duo. Great Netfliix instant option to watch or revisit."

0.0,heavenly_creatures,Disturbing. Didn't like it.

1.0,heavenly_creatures,3rd favorite movie of all time. Saw this movie right when it came out on VHS years ago before DVD.
1.0,heavenly_creatures,"A surprisingly great film that I did not expect to like this much. Peter Jackson's first departure from the gore filled ""Evil Dead 2"" inspired comedies (Dead Alive, Bad Taste) that still manages to maintain the same level of cinematic fantasy that Peter Jackson is most notable for creating."
1.0,heavenly_creatures,The story of two girls and their beautiful and upsetting relationship.
1.0,heavenly_creatures,This is an Awesome movie! great skills of the then unknown actors. (Before Titanic or Two and a half men)
1.0,heavenly_creatures,a pure masterpiece. non debatable

0.0,heavenly_creatures,"Slow-paced, incredibly weird, Lynskey doesn't actually lose any weight when she is supposed to be ""ill"" and ugh I just didn't enjoy it!"
1.0,heavenly_creatures,A timeless classic that you absolutely have to see.
1.0,heavenly_creatures,A decent into delirium
1.0,heavenly_creatures,"Based on a true story. I think this was one of Kate Winslet's first roles. The puppet scenes (dream scenes) are daunting. Great, great piece of film."
1.0,heavenly_creatures,Absolutely amazing and stunningly beautiful with an oscar-worthy performance from Kate Winslet.
1.0,heavenly_creatures,Hypnotic. Peter Jackson before he world knew he had it in him.
1.0,heavenly_creatures,"""...The inner tension of the film emerges from Jackson's enjoyment of the girls' bustling insanity and then his gradual withdrawal from it."""

1.0,heavenly_creatures,These are very good reasons I fear having children.
1.0,heavenly_creatures,Shocking and bleak story! It runs your imagination wild just like the two protagonists of the movie.
1.0,heavenly_creatures,this is what i call a real movie!!
1.0,heavenly_creatures,"This film proves that director Peter Jackson can tackle other subjects and themes in movies, other than his previous 'bad taste' cult films. This is not only one of the best films of 1994, but probably the best film of Jackson's career."
1.0,heavenly_creatures,I highly recommend this gem of a film from one of the most innovative directors still around today.
1.0,heavenly_creatures,Like Kate Winslet? Haven't seen this movie? You should be SHOT!

1.0,heavenly_creatures,"An absolutely riveting film-early in the careers of Peter Jackson and Kate Winslet.The relationship between the girls is incrementally disturbing,culminating in an act of brutality arising from a shared delusion or madness. Based on a true story."
1.0,heavenly_creatures,"A brilliant true story film. It's imaginative, hauntingly-beautiful, and the opera music fit in perfectly with the fantasy scenes."
1.0,heavenly_creatures,"It's a great combination of Jackson's dramatic storytelling and a serious true historical event. Great development of the two characters and performances by two promising actresses. It's hard to believe Winslet did such a great, great debut acting."
1.0,heavenly_creatures,"One of the best true-story films ever made, this film is hauntingly beautful. The more you mull on the story, the more beautiful you realise it is, in a scary way. Kate Winslet shone in this film, and PJ showed that he is AMAZING!"
1.0,heavenly_creatures,"Excellent drama. Shows how the young and the old have a tendency to interact with each other in ignorance and stupidity, leading to horrible results. Oh, and Peter Jackson is a brilliant director."
1.0,heavenly_creatures,An early Peter Jackson drama that shows Jackson's flair for directing fantasy scenes before LOTR. Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey are terrific as the leads.
1.0,heavenly_creatures,Once again Peter Jackson shows that he is a master filmaker. Great movie.
1.0,heavenly_creatures,"Kate Winslet's stunning debut - some of us knew even then that there was an Oscar in her future (well, only one, SO FAR) . . . I've met the real Juliet Hulme - twice."
1.0,heavenly_creatures,Peter Jackson's best film and the one that made me fall in love with Kate Winslet! I love the way that the girls get so caught up in their imaginery world as a means to escape the problems that surrounded them. And it has a wickedly dark ending.
1.0,heavenly_creatures,"From the visionary director of LOTR, this one will enlighten the core of your soul. Truly haunting, it stays with you for a long time..."
1.0,heavenly_creatures,"I haven't watched this in quite a long time, but DAMN! What a great film Quite possibly Jackson's best. Why oh why did he have to turn into such a hack!"
1.0,heavenly_creatures,"Crime and fantasy, Peter Jackson style. (Remember when he was good?)"
1.0,heavenly_creatures,"My favourite Peter Jackson movie.. like it better than his LOTR series. Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey both made their movie debuts here. A very sad, disturbing and compelling true story."

1.0,heavenly_creatures,Another brilliant NZ film
1.0,heavenly_creatures,A creepy tale told through the stylized imagination of two lonely girls. The tension builds subtly but steadily. The acting is flawless and the plot is fresh and unpredictable. Hard to believe the director was known for goofy gory slasher films up to this point. Well worth your time.
1.0,heavenly_creatures,"amazing, shocking, stupifying, mesmerizing- packs a powerful punch on all levels of cinematic experience."
1.0,heavenly_creatures,Why the hell this fantastic movie hasn't come out as DVD?

1.0,heavenly_creatures,"Based on an historical case, a mother's efforts to protect her daughter's already modest social status by attempting to prevent her allegedly taboo behavior leads to her own undoing."
1.0,heavenly_creatures,The fact that this really happened adds an interesting twist to this one. I love the relationship between the two girls and you can see all the emotions involved truly develop as it goes along.
1.0,heavenly_creatures,"Not to be missed. It has a script, characters and exploits film as a mediums inherent possibilities. Peter Jackson went on to direct the Lord of the Rings trillogy. Kate Winslet went on to Titanic. (1994)"
0.0,heavenly_creatures,I thought this was a bit weak! and silly
1.0,heavenly_creatures,"Peter Jackson! You need to make more movies like this!""We realised why Deborah and I have such extraordinary telepathy and why people treat us and look at us the way they do. It is because we are MAD. We are both stark raving MAD!"""
1.0,heavenly_creatures,Peter Jackson's best so far. Devastating.
1.0,heavenly_creatures,"I think it was well done, giving it a genuine look of the 1950s and it showed the fantastic imagination and obsessive minds of the girls really well. Kate Winslet and Melanie Lynskey each gave entirely believable performances."

1.0,heavenly_creatures,one of my favourite movies

1.0,heavenly_creatures,así es la vida. Una bitch
1.0,heavenly_creatures,"Peter Jackson's first attempt at making a ""serious"" film and he pulls it off brilliantly. This film is abounds with imagination, energy and disturbing sequences.

1.0,heavenly_creatures,The progression of friendship through every mood and brought about by the awkwardness of teenage-hood and more-often-than-not-daydreaming xD. Stunning visuals and unforgettable acting.

1.0,heavenly_creatures,"one of my favorite movies ever. dark and sad and scary and makes my stomach feel twisty inside. if you've ever fallen under the spell of your best friend, or had a relationship so intense that you don't know what's real and what you've made up - you should watch this movie."
1.0,heavenly_creatures,"what demented bitchez! lol. but the creepy part is its true. i love kate winslet, shes so awesome!"
1.0,heavenly_creatures,For some crazy reason I loved this movie. I like watching movies about people who lose their minds and this one is a very compelling one. The dynamics between the two main characters is fascinating and disturbing at the same time.
1.0,heavenly_creatures,"This film is AWESOME. What a sick pair of little puppies these two are. Excellent stuff. I read a book about the real crime, and this is how I imagined it to have been. Brilliant."

1.0,heavenly_creatures,"A beautiful and yet disturbed film about New Zealand's true criminal teenage girls and ther fantastical pseudo-sexual relationship, which resulted in murder. Wonderufl performances, and a brilliant early work from Peter Jackson."
1.0,heavenly_creatures,So intimately in touch with the minds of its two killers that the ending still feels like a total shock. You end up loving all the characters in their own ways which is why it's one of the most powerful films ever made.
1.0,heavenly_creatures,"LOTR is amazing, and King Kong too, but this is Jackson as a REAL filmmaker"

0.0,the_spectacular_now,"Why should the audience care about this jerk of a main character? Slow moving to the point of boredom with a thoroughly detestable person at its core. The only redeeming feature is a good change of pace performance by Kyle Chandler, playing yet another dirt bag. Skip it."
1.0,the_spectacular_now,"Sorry, I'm going to say it. A spectacular ""wow"" of a movie that manages to beautifully and perfectly combine a coming of age tale that's so unique and familiar at the same time.

1.0,1003094-brief_encounter,"A woman in 1940's Stodgy England is finding it very, very difficult to remain monogamous despite being married, having 2 kids, and a loving, attentive husband. Done tastefully with much compassion and heart. Early David Lean masterpiece."

1.0,1003094-brief_encounter,It's astonishing that the same man who directed the overblown Lawrence of Arabia was capable of creating this intimate little love story that packs a greater emotional punch than the epic for which he is best known. This masterpiece deserves to be recognized as one of the best films ever made.

1.0,1003094-brief_encounter,"Better with every watch. Fantastic screenplay adapted from Noel Coward's classic play.

1.0,1003094-brief_encounter,Breif Encounter is a beautiful film. One of the great love stories of the everyday which as the title suggest can happen in a brief moment and last a lifetime.

1.0,1003094-brief_encounter,"Such a wonderfully romantic film - the infatuation of two middle-aged, ordinary, married (but not to each other) people.

1.0,1003094-brief_encounter,One of the best i've ever seen!
1.0,1003094-brief_encounter,"Absolutely heart-breaking. Before Lean turned his cameras to the most breath-taking spectacle and locations ever recorded, he was able to deftly capture the epic chambers of human feeling. While ahrdly steamy or torrid, the restrained and pained affair on display here is brutal in its restraint."

1.0,1003094-brief_encounter,This is a great follow-up to Rohmer's Love in the Afternoon. I'd forgotten so much since I'd seen it years ago. I wish Lean had stuck to making films like this.Celia Johnson is remarkable.

1.0,1003094-brief_encounter,One of my all time favourites. I would go as far as to say iconic. Can't listen to Rachmaninov now without hearing steam train whistles and carriage doors slamming.

1.0,1003094-brief_encounter,"Very moving story of two perfectly ordinary people whose lives are turned upside down after a chance meeting at a railway station. All the more powerful for its typically British restraint, the performances are subtle and beautifully understated. A perfect rainy afternoon 'picture'."

1.0,1003094-brief_encounter,"A heartbreakingly beautiful film that fully deserves its reputation as a classic.

1.0,1003094-brief_encounter,"One of the best weepy love stories ever--it proves that death isn't the worst thing that can happen in a love affair. Celia Johnson does a great job, but Trevor Howard really struck me, and made me a big fan. And I love it's use of Rachmaninoff."

1.0,philadelphia_story,Stupendous duel of words and screenplay addiction! Cukor's comedies were never understood when they should've but now they are considered today as incredible pieces of laugh-out-loud entertainment. Great Hollywood stars also knew how to have a blast!  99/100
1.0,philadelphia_story,Fantastic cast! A fun watch.

1.0,philadelphia_story,This movie has one hell of a cast and one hell of a script. This movie is absolutely hysterical and movie just aren't written with the same zing that they did. Truly a wonderful movie that didn't need any vulgarity to be funny. Truly a prime example of what a comedy should be. This is a must watch.
1.0,philadelphia_story,So much to say about what I loved! James Stewart! Katherine Hepburn! Just the story itself. I hope one day to see or be in the play version. :)
1.0,philadelphia_story,"Fully clothed Caucasians standing around using big words no one understands. Not a fart, boob or explosion to be seen... In glorious Black & White! One of my favorites! Would love to play C. K. Dexter Haven someday... ""Mr. Duda, are we being punished?"""

1.0,philadelphia_story,"You know when Hepburn and Stewart are dancing, both heavily drunk, next to the pool, and she gets so close to fall into it, when she spins and her feet goes right to the edge? This scene sums up so sharply the whole point of this movie that, if you notice it just once, you can never forget it."

1.0,philadelphia_story,"The Grant, Hepburn, Stewart love triangle is perfectly crafted with plenty of smart wit and romance. We really don't get films like this anymore."
1.0,philadelphia_story,"If Joseph Mankiewicz did anything, he wrote outstanding dialogue. The language and interplay of debate and discussion is familiar and reminds you of All About Eve, also written by Mankiewicz. So which is the greater of the brothers? Joseph or Hermann who co-wrote a little thing called Citizen Kane."
1.0,philadelphia_story,"Grant, Stewart & Hepburn...what's not to love!"

1.0,philadelphia_story,"Take a dream cast, a witty screenplay and George Cukor and you get the ultimate feel-good film. The chemistry between Hepburn, Grant and Stewart is truly unique and always a treat to watch."
1.0,philadelphia_story,"Stellar cast, scintillating script...doesn't get much better than this. In the days before special effects, when actors had to talk, and audiences had to listen and pay attention (an art that has been lost forever, I'm afraid)."
1.0,philadelphia_story,"A hilarious romance with enough complication to keep it interesting, but never compromises to superficiality. Benefits strongly from including three generations in a meaningful way, and Cary Grant nails his part so well it's scary."

1.0,philadelphia_story,Seriously. Amazing. The Cary Grant/Jimmy Stewart drunk scene is worth it alone!
1.0,philadelphia_story,"Such a good film. Who she ends up with is kind of predictable but still worth a watch. Classic Jimmy Stewart. Or maybe I just think he's super classy. Katharine Hepburn was brilliant. I love the scene where Tracy and Mike are, shall we say, tipsy."

1.0,1083436-1083436-out_of_sight,Really stunningly excellent movie. Sometimes I forget how good of an actor Lopez is when she has a script worth digging into and a good cast to work with. Real question is why it took me 14 years to see this movie.
1.0,1083436-1083436-out_of_sight,Clooney and Lopez were hot in this.

1.0,1083436-1083436-out_of_sight,A very smart film that floors you with its control of both suspense and humor. Clooney and Lopez are two loaded pistols stunning in their sly charisma.

1.0,1083436-1083436-out_of_sight,"Steven has a great talent to creat the atmosphere through photography, sound and fragmented dialogues. Of cause not without such a chemistry between Goerge and Jen. I agree with Forbes - it's the sexiest movie ever... besides it's extremely funny:D"

1.0,1083436-1083436-out_of_sight,"Clooney, Rhames, Keener, Zahn and Cheadle at their peaks. Soderbergh playing filmic jazz. Fantastic support by Farina, Keaton, Washington, Brooks, Davis, Guzman and Samuel L. JLo in her last real acting gig, and carrying her weight.

1.0,1083436-1083436-out_of_sight,A movie so good it single-handedly justifies Jennifer Lopez' claim to be a good actress.
1.0,1083436-1083436-out_of_sight,One of my favorite movies. Excellent performances from everyone and great story. A great movie that alot of people prolly dont know about. Go netflix it as soon as possible!
1.0,1083436-1083436-out_of_sight,One of my all time favorites -- the only role Jennifer Lopez (pre JLo) was really effective in. The editing in this film is so wonderful....and Clooney was born to play Foley. A Soderbergh classic.
1.0,1083436-1083436-out_of_sight,This is what happens when Soderbergh actually has a script and doesn't try to get cute. He makes a good movie.
1.0,1083436-1083436-out_of_sight,SEXY ASS MOVIE FROM START TO FINISH!
1.0,1083436-1083436-out_of_sight,"This movie is so cool. And also hot. And really smart. And funny. And action-packed. The comprehensive entertainment experience, apparently. When I first randomly rented it in 1999, I asked myself, ""Who is this Steven Soderbergh?'"

1.0,1083436-1083436-out_of_sight,Lots of fun with interesting characters and a smart script. J-Lo's redemption for so much crap to follow.
1.0,1083436-1083436-out_of_sight,"One of the best movies I've ever seen. It has everything!! Action, romance, murder, prison breakouts, bank roberies, humour, and George Clooney in a bathtub!!"

1.0,1083436-1083436-out_of_sight,This movie gets better every time I watch this. Jennifer Lopez is very good in this. Could be because of a great director. Nowadays she makes crappy films with crappy directors.
1.0,1083436-1083436-out_of_sight,"Great direction by Soderbergh, great chemistry between the two leads. Clooney is perfect, and this is likely Jennifer Lopez's best film."

1.0,1083436-1083436-out_of_sight,"Jennifer Lopez acts - like, really acts. George Clooney being Clooney, but back in the day. Most importantly, it's the only movie to have the beating heart and dry wit of a 30s/40s rom-com with the experimental narrative playfulness and irony of now."

1.0,amelie,An incredibly fun and moving masterpiece.
1.0,amelie,"One of my favourite movies, I could watch it on repeat. The story is well paced, the director does an amazing job executing the film, wonderful music. This movie is unique and strange but at the same time it's your typical rom-com movie. If you haven't watched it you definitely should."
1.0,amelie,"If you can let go of skepticism and let Amelie sweep you along, she can renew your belief in love, kindness, and that you can flourish in a world where you don't fit in."

1.0,amelie,One of my favourite films ever. All the times it happened to watch it I always found something I didn't remember or noticed. And if you ask me why I like it so much I really can't tell. Maybe because in the end is just a modern tale.

0.0,amelie,"One of the worst movies I've ever seen. The plot lacks structure and never goes anywhere, and the characters aren't likeable. Some parts of it make no sense either! The way it's filmed and edited just didn't work for me either. Truly atrocious, sad is rated so highly for being kinda artsy"
1.0,amelie,'Amelie' will unveil the biggest charm in you.

1.0,before_sunrise,"This film, this series, should be much, much bigger than it is. It's up there with the best. It is seriously talented film-making, from all involved. Nobody should question the romantic comedy genre until they've walked through France with Ethan and Julie."

0.0,before_sunrise,One of the most boring movies I 've seen. There is nothing fresh or original about it. If romantic means tons of cliché marvelously piled one on top of the other I guess the script nailed it. Never got why so many people like this particular movie.

1.0,before_sunrise,Ethan Hawke with his boyish charm and Julie Delpy with her unadulterated beauty give wonderfully natural performances in a film that is as philosophically challenging as it is audaciously romantic.

1.0,before_sunrise,"A beautiful story of boy-meets-girl. But they don't know that is the ""moment"" of perfect union of heart and mind. Life is likely to take them afar, but nothing would add to the sparkling lightness of their first love."
1.0,before_sunrise,Love story at it's candid best
1.0,before_sunrise,"I loved this movie. It was just too pleasant and endearing to simply dismiss as an average romance film, which it certainly wasn't. I believed in the romance between this couple more than I did in most Hollywood romance pictures."
1.0,before_sunrise,This is the kind of film I really admire. Two actors having their time. To me pretty amazing... First part of really nice romantic trilogy ...
1.0,before_sunrise,Linklater paints the picture of the relationship we would all like to have and it is aware of that.

1.0,before_sunrise,Jesse and Celine walk along the streets of Vienna as theycompletely and unobtrusively swept each other off their feet (and yours as well); mesmerizing you from beginning to end.
1.0,before_sunrise,"The material is good enough to hold its own against any classic romantic film, but due to the genre going down the crapper since the 80s and beyond, it probably won't be seen as the classic it truly is.  Personally, I think it's one of the finest romances since 'Casablanca.'"

1.0,before_sunrise,Before Sunrise perfectly captures the euphoria of falling in love. It may be the most romantic movie I've ever seen.
0.0,before_sunrise,"The worst - fast forwarded through last half to see if it got any better - insipid dialogue - booooring, he's a jerk, who could be interested. If I met him on a train, I would run."
1.0,before_sunrise,the movie is a surreal experience with two of the most well written and played characters I have seen on screen. the plot is minimalist and is basically just the two leads walking around Vienna and talking and yet I have never been more interested. Great film.

1.0,before_sunrise,"Before Sunrise is a romantic film but it follows almost no romantic genre convention.

1.0,before_sunrise,"Nothing else quite catches the true essence of romance like Before Sunrise did.

1.0,before_sunrise,"Unless you're completely braindead, it's surely impossible not to love this movie. I was dismayed to find that Julie Delpy's somewhat of a bitch as a person, because I fell in love with her character as much as Ethan Hawke's character did."

1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,Cute movie! I live it! :-D
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,"Marilyn in the role that helped make Madonna a star many years later. Jane Russell holds her own playing the determined and ballsy best friend to Monroe's naive bubblehead. Seriously funny, but not entirely flattering for women in the modern age."

0.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,"A 90-minute film with 40 minutes of sloppy song-and-dance does not an enjoyable film make. The only thing more appalling than the morals of this film was the acting, singing, and dancing. Boy, did I hate this."
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,"Kanske Marilyns bÃ¤sta film, dÃ¤r hennes charm glÃ¤nser rakt igenom. SÃ¤rskilt bredvid stela Jane Russell, som ofattbart nog var det stora namnet pÃ¥ den tiden som filmen gjordes. Hon fick mycket mer betalt fÃ¶r filmen Ã¤r Marilyn."

1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,"favourite scene- Marilyn trapped halfway thru porthole, then saved by child millionaire. genius! x"
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,This is a classic would strongly recommend.A very good feel good movie. But they new how to make films then
0.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,Certainly did not prefer the blonde in this one. Marilyn Monroe was annoying. I even prefered Jane Russell's version of Diamonds are a Girl's Bestfriend to hers.
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,One of her greatest films. She truly is a star on screen that has yet to be matched. A must see movie with some of the most memorable moments in her too short career. Love the movie and Marilyn even more.
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,"One of my all time favorite Marilyn movies. Great storyline, great actors and generally wonderful overall. The costumes are beautiful and it's a classic for many reasons. The music always make me smile and the ending leaves you smiling."
0.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,oldy is kinda embarassing by today's standards..women looking for rich husbands..does that ever change ? Nothing noteworthy unless you're a Monroe fan
0.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,That's why Monroe was a brunette. I guess she must have a Brazillen.

1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,one of tha best marilyn movies EVER!!
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,It's a little hard to root for Marilyn to marry to the dorky rich guy but the rest of the film is so damn funny and pleasant to watch that it hardly matters. I sometimes forget what a great commedienne she was and this film proves it in spades.
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,UNTIL SHE WAS MURDERED MARILYN WAS A SUPERSTAR WHO WAS JUST STARTING TO COME INTO HER OWN.
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,Such a darling movie...just love it...especially Marilyn of course...

1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,I totally adore Monroe she was the perfect lady so stunning and coquettish.

1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,"Lorelei Lee in that pink dress and those diamonds was my aesthetic model way back when. Her morality, however, is delightfully wayward and justified in a way which could only have held water in the 1950s. Terrific tunes too."
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,"Diamonds realy are a girls best friend! :) Wow, fab film!"
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,Bye Bye Baby = greatest song in the whole movie

1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,"Hilarious and outrageous examination of gender politics circa 1953. Monroe and Russell are an awesome comic duo. And it's a musical to boot. Hawks really could do it all, couldn't he?"
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,"""is there anyone here for love?"""
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,"A wondefull, witty comedy with Marilyn Monroe at her best. Also has some loaded undertones about gender roles and goldigging. Is it empowering? Degrading? On thing is sure, it's great fun."
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,Diamonds are a Girls Best Friend! What more can I say? I know the words and all the songs backwards I've watched it so many times. Marilyn at her pouty best and Jane Russell fabulously bolshy as her mate and chaperone.

0.0,four_weddings_and_a_funeral,I don't get the hype. It wasn't that realistic. Who falls in love so quickly with someone they've only met (slept with) twice? Everything else about the movie was great. The main loveline? Terrible.

1.0,enchanted,Enchanted is a beautiful and gratifying fairytale set in modern times and circumstances that cunningly avoids clichés by focusing on optimism and the anti-sappy version of true love. All filled with gorgeous sing-along songs and dazzling performances from a delightful cast.

1.0,enchanted,Amy Adams is so cute in the best collaboration of live action and animation in a Disney movie since Mary Poppins and Roger Rabbit.

1.0,the_artist,A beautiful love story with exquisite music.
1.0,the_artist,Makes you fall in love with its silent characters easier than almost every other movie that has dialogue.
0.0,the_artist,"If this film had been made in 1920, no one would speak of it now because it actually says nothing."
1.0,the_artist,"Awesome movie! First black in whit silence I've liked. Of course it's produced in my generation, but its really great considering the big leap from silent films to ""talkies""."

0.0,the_artist,awfully predictable and cheesy and grossly overrated.
1.0,the_artist,One of my favorite movies of all time
1.0,the_artist,The Artist is a touching way of displaying what used to be modern films. It was necessary for it to be black and white and silent.
1.0,the_artist,"Best Picture winning Silent Film of 2011.Combination of: Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Douglas Fairbanks, Fred Astaire, and Gene Kelly."
1.0,the_artist,Easily one of the greatest films of the 21st century so far.

1.0,the_artist,I was in a roller coaster of emotions. It was pure gold this movie! How beautiful it was! Glad I watched it tonight.
1.0,the_artist,Amazing acting & score.
1.0,the_artist,"Even it is a black-and-white silent movie; it is a witty and jolly movie to watch. It has a great story and peculiar visual style. With great performances from Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo, it is surely a masterpiece from Michel Hazanavicius."
1.0,the_artist,"Enchantingly beautiful, and surprisingly profound."
1.0,the_artist,"I admit, I have a weakness for black-and-white films. The Artist is a modern classic, transporting us to a time when artistry in the film industry was highly regarded, before Hollywood took over with its ""fluff""."
1.0,the_artist,"Probably the most unique film I've ever seen in my life! I loved the movie. I thought I would get bored with the lack of sound, but I actually found myself heavily engrossed in the story it alone told. I felt it was brilliant story telling!"

1.0,the_artist,One of the best movies ever made!!!
1.0,the_artist,A feast for all lovers of the cinema.
1.0,the_artist,"Phenomenal. A masterpiece of cleverness, magic, joy and despair. Director/Writer Michel Hazanavicius has dared to take a film society fixated on re-imagining back to its roots."
1.0,the_artist,"The Artist, crowd-pleasing as it is nostalgic and joyous, mixes a variety of pleasure and nods to the old days to be perfection. If it wasn't silent, it wouldn't be as good. Intellectually written, Michel Hazanavicius is a genius film-maker if he wrote and directed this masterpiece."
1.0,the_artist,Heart breaking tale of the descent of a heroic star of the silent era upstaged by his love interest. Few films can reach into your heart to the extent this film brilliantly achieves.
1.0,the_artist,a true gem that needs to be seen by everybody
1.0,the_artist,"I didn't know what to expect and after watching it I was amazed at what it actually is. it is amazing, heartwarming and infectious. It almost sneaks up on you with its charm. Charm is the perfect word for the direction, the screenplay, and the lead actor. A movie to just sit back and enjoy..."
0.0,the_artist,Yawn! I fully accept the flaw may be with me but I lasted less than 20 minutes - then watched Batman Dark Knight Rising again! I'm clearly not cultured :)
0.0,the_artist,I couldn't even finish watching it.
0.0,the_artist,Awful. An uninteresting story made quirky by silence. I enjoy many silent movies but if this had been made back then it would not have even got a general release.
1.0,the_artist,"A fun, artistic, and spectacular tribute to the beauty and comedy of the silent film era."
1.0,the_artist,This was definitely a different experience since I am used to nothing but films with talking. It was wonderful!
1.0,the_artist,"Fantastic. I don't see any other movie that could come close this year.

1.0,the_artist,How did this movie not get a 100%? Shame on you 4 critics
1.0,the_artist,"Great movie. It was quite inovative for our time (which is funny considering it is essentially a silent film). Great acting, quite comedic but yet with a serious story to it. It did feel quite foreign to the ears though, watching a movie that had no sound to except the music."
1.0,the_artist,"Wonderful. One of my favourite films of all time. 1920s Hollywood rom-com, an adorable mutt, wonderful performances all round - and a surprise twist at the end. What is not to love?"

1.0,the_artist,I didn't expect that at all. Really good movie.
0.0,the_artist,I didn't like this movie at all. All movies should have sound in them not wait until the very end. You can't feel the emotions of the actors and actresses without hearing them. You have to keep your eye on the screen the WHOLE time and it isn't fun to just watch a movie.
1.0,the_artist,So happy I saw this. Best movie of 2011.
1.0,the_artist,Yeah. It's really that good.
1.0,the_artist,"To give you an idea of how great this movie is, I took my 12 year old daughter to see it, it is Black and White and no dialogues. She asked to see it again and has been recommending it to all her friends. 'Nuff Said."

1.0,the_artist,"The Artist is a genuine rarity of a masterpiece, a french perspective on American silent film, and there is absolutely no shock behind how it won best film of the year during the academy awards of 2012, as it's spirited, charming, and executed with the utmost skill."
1.0,the_artist,"Excelente, brillante, magistral, cautivadora, sorprendente; esa y mil palabras más se merece como adjetivo calificativo ""El artista"". Una hermosa obra de arte."
1.0,the_artist,"A great film that shows just how simple it is to tell a great story. I feel like this film is a outcry to studios that you don't need parlor tricks, CGI, and cheesy stories to make something entertaining. Highly recommended and a must-see for any fan of cinema or filmmaking."

1.0,the_artist,"The Artist is a charming and bright movie about the introduction of ""talkies"" into the film industry in the 1920's and follows around two characters. This movie is brilliant with no shortage of wit, humor, foreshadowing, and good acting. It is a must see for anyone who enjoys good films."

1.0,the_artist,A great movie... with great performance and musics. Definitely one of the best picture in 2011... Not quite sure if it deserves to win an Oscar though.
1.0,the_artist,"The only movie besides The Return of the King to make me have full on sobs of joy. An original, light-hearted movie that explains the change in technology and filmmaking in the 20s. Instead of tugging at heart strings, it basically ripped mine out."

1.0,the_artist,While it does tred familiar ground (Sunst Boulavard and Singin' in the Rain) but it over comes these elements with a truly affecting tale and inspired direction.
0.0,the_artist,Finally got around to watching this fine work -- winner of the 2011 Academy Award for Best Picture. This movie toppled the 24-year reign of Running Man (1987; starring Richard Dawson) as the #1 Worst Movie I Have Seen in My Life.
1.0,the_artist,Bold assertion of the standing of French cinema in relation to Hollywood given added irony when it became the first French film to clean up at the Oscars.
1.0,the_artist,"This is a movie that's actually worthy of an Oscar nomination and worthy of winning it, unlike last year's snorefest, The King's Speech. The acting in this movie is great, the music is great,and the dog deserves an Oscar nomination. Definitely worth watching over and over."
1.0,the_artist,"So great, I love it!"
1.0,the_artist,One of the best movies of the year has become the most awarded show of the year too and it deserved them all.With perfect actors' help Hazanavicius gives us the perfect silent/black and white movie we missed for a long time.
1.0,the_artist,"Romantic and funny and sad all in different places, this is cinema perfection. It shows that a film doesn't need sound to have heart. The acting is ask superb and the soundtrack is spot on. Gorgeous, nostalgic and one-of-a-kind. You won't see its like again."
1.0,the_artist,I am in awe of this movie for its unique style of presentation. I am also impressed of its massive characterization regardless of the fact that it is a silent film. This film truly deserves all the awards it earned!

1.0,the_artist,An excellent take on silent movies with a modern twist and sensibilities.
1.0,the_artist,There's nothing greater for movie fans but a movie about those who love cinema. It doesn't hurt that it's told in an original way.

1.0,the_artist,Very cute and talented
0.0,the_artist,I've seen my first and last silentmovie.
0.0,the_artist,"Chalk it up to another frightfully dull, non-envelope-pushing, cheerfully middlebrow Oscar-winner. For a proper tribute to silent filmmaking there's Guy Maddin, the B&W; sequence in Pedro Almodovar's ""Talk to Her"" and few else."
1.0,the_artist,"One of the best movies depicting the history of silent cinema, The Artist is touching and charming throughout."
1.0,the_artist,Absolutely an enjoyable lost art form.

1.0,1008166-general,This is a standard for burlesque.
1.0,1008166-general,One of the greatest comedies of all time.
1.0,1008166-general,"Timeless and comedic in a way, Buster Keaton's The General is one of the best of the silent era"
1.0,1008166-general,"Not the same type as Sherlock Jr., but the movement of camera and pictures of the film are tremendous; maybe one of the greatest comedy of all time."
1.0,1008166-general,"Just amazing.Really, really impressive scenes with the railway engines and a physically incredible Keaton."
1.0,1008166-general,Buster once broke his neck making a film and continued working the rest of the day because he was unaware his neck was broken. He did many dangerous stunts himself and that perfectionism is most apparent in this masterpiece. The creativity of this film is astounding.
1.0,1008166-general,"One of the all-time greatest silent films & comedies, this masterpiece still holds-up almost 90yrs later. Keaton really was something special, he always did his own stunts and they are often spectacular. This film is a MUST for any film enthusiast, I thoroughly enjoyed revisiting it on Blu-ray."
1.0,1008166-general,The only problem is that Keaton was in the wrong side of the war.
0.0,1008166-general,"No sé como aguanté 30 mins, merezco una medalla jaja, envejeció mal esta película"
1.0,1008166-general,"A true classic in every sense of the word, hysterically funny like few others and featuring some of the most exciting locomotive chases ever filmed, as well as an epic-scale production, a beautiful score and a cinematography in sepia that feels like a travel in time."
1.0,1008166-general,And it's true perfection on the screen.
1.0,1008166-general,I can't even try to compare the quality of this comedy masterpiece to any comedy film released in this year.
1.0,1008166-general,This is a romantic adventure-comedy about a train. It is literally everything I look for in a movie.
1.0,1008166-general,Classic silent comedy with wonderful chase scenes that depend highly on comic timing.
1.0,1008166-general,"Not only a very funny comedy, but an excellent romance and a superb action-adventure movie as well. Is creative on levels we rarely see today, without any talking, color, and minimal special effects."
1.0,1008166-general,"I saw a review that states ""Almost perfect entertainment"" - and that's how I've felt any time I've watched this. Buster Keaton is just delightful. Apparently some don't agree, but I don't think there is a slow or boring moment in this film."

1.0,1008166-general,"This is one of the greatest films I've ever seen, and it works on so many levels. All of the jokes work, from the simple ones to the more complex one. The costumes and sets and props and everything looks excellent. The story was great. This is a great introduction to silent film."
1.0,1008166-general,Simple and beautifully shot. A charming little film from Buster Keaton.

1.0,1008166-general,What a ingenious piece of filmmaking!
1.0,1008166-general,Definitely my favorite of Keaton's so far.
1.0,1008166-general,"The dialogue sucks (ha!). But really, Buster Keaton's The General is one of the best silent movies. The action and stunts of the trains are amazing and make me watch in awe. The music also adds a great deal, making you feel sad for Keaton's character."
1.0,1008166-general,"Keaton's best film, the Silent eras best film, and one of the greatest films ever, as far as I am concerned!"
1.0,1008166-general,Buster Keaton was a genius.
1.0,1008166-general,Buster Keaton was a genius.
1.0,1008166-general,"Definitely Keaton's best film. Solid on plot, action, comedy and romance. A well rounded silent film."
1.0,1008166-general,Buster Keaton is masterly to have made a film with such a perfect fluidity that it matches the apparent effortlessness of his own stunts.
1.0,1008166-general,"Great slapstick fun. Even though I wanted the Union to win, I couldn't help rooting for the irresistible comedic charms of Buster Keaton."
1.0,1008166-general,The best movie ever.
1.0,1008166-general,"The General is so elegantly excellent, interlacing plot, character and slapstick, and develops them like art."
1.0,1008166-general,"The genius Buster Keaton's 1927 film The General is fitfully funny, oddly suspenseful & hopelessly romantic. If you don't have a grand time with it you're just a bore. A total masterpiece."
1.0,1008166-general,Great chase sequence.
1.0,1008166-general,Buster Keaton ensured his place in film history with this magical movie. No words are needed to enthrall you in the events unfolding.
1.0,1008166-general,This film is the definition of the word timeless!
1.0,1008166-general,"Still funny, still amazing."
1.0,1008166-general,Wow! Surprisingly exciting. Keaton's character is quite lovable. The subtle sexism is also very amusing.
1.0,1008166-general,Joseph received this as a gift for Christmas. I had seen it before and loved it. The copy we watched looked great on the HD TV. This is an excellent movie set during the Civil War. It is whitty and exciting. The cinematography is amazing for 1926. I would recomment this movie to anyone.

1.0,1008166-general,One of the great classics of silent cinema! A great example of the power of pure filmmaking.
1.0,1008166-general,"Fun story with incredible timing from Buster Keaton, especially all the stuff where he is jumping on and off the train. The plot is simple enough, and Keaton has a real talent for misunderstanding comedy, and the fact that a lot of it had to be done in one shot makes it all the more great."
1.0,1008166-general,"Arguably, Buster Keaton's masterpiece. But whether or not it is, it is a classic film, that is very recognizable, and is ground breaking work for it's time. Almost perfect entertainment, and brilliant chases, make one of the most enjoyable films you could ever watch."
1.0,1008166-general,"Proof that you don't need fancy computers and loud music to make a great film. Not just a great silent film, but one of the all-time greats period."

1.0,1008166-general,"Unstoppable, my ass. Denzel and that generic white guy've got nothing on Buster Keaton. (On a side note - The version streaming on Netflix features some pretty atrocious music by the Alloy Orchestra, whoever they are. I almost turned the sound off completely.)"

1.0,1008166-general,One of my favourite movies. Saw it for the first time in high definition -- it was glorious!! Astonishing look for a 84 year old film! I wish for HD-treatment of many more old films!
1.0,1008166-general,"The most fantastic silent movie I've ever watched. It is the work of a perfect genious. A movie full of action, comedy and wit. Just adorable."
1.0,1008166-general,Brilliant! One of the greatest movie ever made.
1.0,1008166-general,Wow! Surprisingly exciting. Keaton's character is quite lovable. The subtle sexism is also very amusing.
1.0,1008166-general,"I love this movie!! Great visuals, and a fantastic film score that will go down as one of my all time favorites!!"
1.0,1008166-general,This movie has no flaws. Buster Keaton is perfect. The action and the stunts are perfect. The train chase is perfect. This film cannot be improved upon.
1.0,1008166-general,"Probably one of the coolest civil war movies ever made. It is perfect in almost every way. And it is incredible. If you told me that I was going to watch a 50 minute train chase and never get bored, I wouldn't believe you. But I did watch it and I never got bored. It is a masterpiece."
1.0,1008166-general,"I've seen ""The General"" more times than any other movie, and I'm always amazed at how brilliantly funny it is while treating the Civil War with epic seriousness, all this in 78 minutes."
1.0,1008166-general,One of the best examples of how to tell a story visually.
1.0,1008166-general,One of my new all time favourite movies. The best silent film ever and one of the greatest comedies ever. Poetry in motion.
1.0,1008166-general,"Manages to make death in battle funny THREE TIMES. Depends very little on titles, which was cool. And I challenge anyone to watch it without wanting to give Buster Keaton a hug."
1.0,1008166-general,"Keaton, an outstanding director"
1.0,1008166-general,"One of the funniest films ever crafted! If Charlie Chaplin ever had any competition, it was and is Buster Keaton. All laughter aside, this is still an astounding feat in filmmaking. A must-see for everyone born into this world!"
1.0,1008166-general,O filme mais brilhante de Keaton... um dos maiores do mudo...
1.0,1008166-general,Buster Keaton + Trains = a great film. Inspires me to make silent b & w films. Buster Keaton is a genious and an under rated film maker.This film is in my top 15 for sure.
1.0,1008166-general,Definitely one of the best silent movies ever made. Buster Keaton's physical comedy is brilliant. The stunts are amazing. The story-telling is riveting. If only most of the movies made today were as interesting and entertaining as this!
1.0,1008166-general,I think this is the best movie ever made.
1.0,1008166-general,Keaton's best film - and one of the very best films ever made.
1.0,1008166-general,Una de las mejores peliculas de la historia. Genial Buster Keaton.

0.0,1008166-general,This Johnson wasn't designed to watch Silent Movies.
1.0,1008166-general,Buster Keaton ensured his place in film history with this magical movie. No words are needed to enthrall you in the events unfolding.
1.0,1008166-general,"I watched the new blu-ray and it looks sublime. One of Keaton's best and one of the greatest films ever made. I am not sure I can think of a better, more richly textured period piece: The Good, The Bad, The Ugly? Barry Lyndon?"
1.0,1008166-general,Wonderful! I haven't smiled and laughed along with a movie like that in quite some time.
1.0,1008166-general,What a wonderful film... stupid Yanks!
1.0,1008166-general,"Up there with ""Sherlock, Jr."" as one of my favorite Keaton comedies. Easily one of the best, most satisfying, and innovative comedies of all time."
1.0,1008166-general,"Yet another example of the charm of silent films is portrayed here, with a simple script, sweet comedy and expressive acting."
1.0,1008166-general,"Not just one of the greatest silent films of all time, but one of history's great movies altogether."
1.0,1008166-general,This is the best silent film I've ever seen and should even appeal to those too stuck up to consider silent films as an option. I'd also have to include this on a list of the funniest movies I've ever seen. It still has the power in its humor to make me laugh out loud.
1.0,1008166-general,"Magnificent production, comedy at its best.-"
1.0,1008166-general,My favorite film of all time.
1.0,1008166-general,My favorite film of all time.
1.0,1008166-general,"Buster Keaton at his best. The General mixes comedy, action, and suspense better than just about any other film I've seen."
1.0,1008166-general,i can watch this a thousand times...its awesome
1.0,1008166-general,Un film de poursuite en train oÃ¹ les acrobaties de Buster keaton rivalisent avec les moments poÃ©tiques et comiques. Du trÃ¨s grand cinÃ©ma muet aussi gÃ©nial que les Chaplin.
1.0,1008166-general,"So good, you forget it's silent!"
1.0,1008166-general,Beautifully silly. Never a dull moment.
1.0,1008166-general,"A hilarious and thrilling classic film. Builds, swirls, and captures the heart like a charming melody performed by a masterful orchestra. Buster Keaton is absolutely wonderful."
1.0,1008166-general,"So easy to watch over and over again. It has charm, an ingredient missing from so many Hollywood blockbusters tofay."
1.0,1008166-general,"Buster Keaton is amazing and I absolutely love this film. Keaton is both tragic and funny at the same time. I can watch it again and again. The stunts keep surprising and amazing me. I really like the filmposter too, but I guess that's slightly irrelevant for a moviereview."
1.0,1008166-general,"comedy + love story, in the simplicity lies the secret of this great movie.. :D"
1.0,1008166-general,"Amazing camera work and choreography for all of the train scenes. Sweet, funny and subtle."
1.0,1008166-general,amazing. buster blew my mind...
1.0,1008166-general,A GREAT movie by a fantastic artist.
1.0,1008166-general,ahhhh what a pleasure. comedic form is so much more satisfying than comedic content which is all that today's comedians care about
1.0,1008166-general,haha Great old time movie
1.0,1008166-general,Hilarious - a truly wonderful movie.
1.0,1008166-general,"Une delicieuse comedie mettant en scene Buster Keaton dans des situations plus improbables et rocambolesques que jamais.Les scenes de ""course-poursuite"" en train sont de veritables merveilles d'humour et d'inventivite.Excellent film !"
1.0,1008166-general,Probably Buster Keaton's best work.
1.0,1008166-general,"The Civil War at its funniest, I guess. Keaton is ingenious in his solemn belief in his own ingenuity. I agree with Roger Ebert who said that Keaton was a modern visitor to the world of the silent clowns. (The live music accompaniment was wonderful, too. Man, those students are good!)"
1.0,1008166-general,Beautifully silly. Never a dull moment.
1.0,1008166-general,Just about the only movie about the Civil War i can say i fully enjoy.
1.0,1008166-general,"The hero is earnest; the humor comes from the impossible situations in which he finds himself. Filmed in a day and age when they could drop a real steam locomotive into a real ravine, so there are no distractions due to models or CGI."
1.0,1008166-general,"La mejor película de Buster Keaton. Los gags son geniales, y en ellos juega un papel fundamental la cara siempre impertérrita y seria de Buster Keaton. Recomendable 100%"
1.0,1008166-general,"maagisen oivaltavaa meininkiä, hauska ja jännittäväkin = neliä tähteäkesti alle 80min = viimenenki tähti!!"
1.0,1008166-general,Buster Keaton ci regala oltre un'ora di azione senza sosta quando il cinema andava ancora inventato.
1.0,1008166-general,"""My God! There's only one man on that train!"""
1.0,1008166-general,Fantastic film. Equally hilarious and exciting. Silent movies are the best.
1.0,1008166-general,"it seems to be coasting along and then astonishes you with impossible physical feats, done without doubles or special effects. his handling of the railroad ties is ingenious. i'm so excited to discover the rest of the buster keaton classics."
1.0,1008166-general,Amazing... not Buster Keaton's best but damn close
1.0,1008166-general,"While not as consistanly hilarious as Sherlock Jr, The General is still a masterpiece of silent cinema. Keaton is marvellous, and a joy to watch."
1.0,1008166-general,"I saw the last half of this on TV long ago and busted up... could not believe a silent film from the 20s could have me on my knees laughing. Saw the whole thing on Netflix, and it's definitely in my top ten."
1.0,1008166-general,The best movie of Buster keaton
1.0,1008166-general,"Absolutely hilarious, thoroughly deserves its reputation. Keaton's stunts are truly astonishing, some of them literally made me gasp in disbelief."
1.0,1008166-general,"Classic silent movie starring the legendary Buster Keaton. Highly entertaining and full of comic genius. Since this is the early days of movies, Keaton actually did a lot of his own dangerous stunts. A great movie for anyone who can handle watching a black and white silent movie."
1.0,1008166-general,"This is a very entertaining movie. It doesn't matter how old you are, it is very funny even without sound. There is some great physical comedy from Buster Keaton. His dead pan facial expression just kills me. This is just a good hearted movie and I highly recommend it."
1.0,1008166-general,"This was my first silent movie, and I loved it. Buster Keaton is so good. What a great story."
1.0,1008166-general,Amazing. Definitely one of the top silent films I've seen.
1.0,1008166-general,Perhaps the funniest movie ever made?
1.0,1008166-general,"still the boldest, and probably the best, of all action comedies; if the train blow-up scene (among just many of others) doesn't have an impact on you, just give up watching movies."
1.0,1008166-general,Plutot de l'ecole Keaton que Chaplin pour ma part
1.0,1008166-general,"Perfect comedy, visual language, my hero. Absolute best with score by Joe Hisaishi."
1.0,1008166-general,A true classic! :) The one Keaton is most remembered for.
1.0,1008166-general,"Definately one of the best things Keaton has done (which is saying a lot), it's worth seeing for the sequence where a train runs off a collapsing bridge. No CGI folks, no model work, just the real deal. It's also one of the better Civil War movies out there. This is a must-see."
1.0,1008166-general,"Possibly the funniest film ever made. Keaton plays Johnnie, a Southern train engineer, who when his engine (the titular General) is hijacked by Northern soldiers must try and get it back. Jam packed with enough gags to fill a dozen modern comedies."
1.0,1008166-general,Simply unavoidable! Nothing better than seeing it with an orquestra on live in el foso del castell de Montjuïc.
1.0,1008166-general,"This is essentially Keaton doing a chase film, probably the most inventive I've seen. The film ends in a war scene impressive in scope. There is generally more suspense and action than comedy."
1.0,1008166-general,"If I were to be an iconic film comedian, I always pictured myself as Buster Keaton. And not because I'm a master of the pratfall."
1.0,1008166-general,This is really an oldie
1.0,1008166-general,Classic! Odd how Buster Keaton blew off three of his finger-tips with a bomb and how he broke his neck riding the front of the train!
1.0,1008166-general,Esencial Buster Keaton
1.0,1008166-general,"Buster Keaton defined the silent era, much more so than Chaplin. Give this a viewing (preferably on a big screen)."
1.0,1008166-general,"Amazing film that, is great all around especially for when it was made. I actually prefer this film than any of the Chaplin films that I have seen. That is how good Buster Keaton is."
1.0,1008166-general,"he is more than an actor, he is one of the best stunts also."
1.0,1008166-general,"Probably one of the best silent films ever made. Probably also the first dramedy ever made. Very influential, and surprisingly gripping, despite the lack of dialog."
1.0,1008166-general,This film is amazing even by today's standards. Keaton was way ahead of his time.
1.0,1008166-general,Buster Keaton's filmmaking at its best before he was forced to sign with MGM.
1.0,1008166-general,Buster Keaton is a God
1.0,1008166-general,"hihi, it´s still funny"
1.0,1008166-general,"I finally got a chance to see this with a live organ accompaniment. Even people I was with who ""hate old movies"" were howling. One of my best theater experiences ever."
1.0,1008166-general,"Here´s a piece of art, a film in his hole conception. Keaton was out of his time, and even now, his performance surprise you."
1.0,1008166-general,"must watch guys, you will laugh and laugh and laugh.....just hilarious!too hilarious....what can I say, you need to watch this."
1.0,1008166-general,This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Hands down.
1.0,1008166-general,...filmed in Oregon...Trains and Romance.. Keaton is so hot. 'nuff said.
1.0,1008166-general,"Maybe the funniest movie ever made. If it's not, it's top 3 for sure. You'll be on the floor for 85 minutes straight."
1.0,1008166-general,"The whole picture is a metaphor for life. Keaton is more noticeably cerebral than Chaplin; he communicates more with less, the gags are less intricate, and while maybe not as funny, they work for theme. It's a chase movie!"
1.0,1008166-general,Absolutely brilliant.
1.0,1008166-general,"One of my favourite Buster Keaton films, The General perfectly showcases Buster's incredible physical skills and his gift for timeless comedy. Brilliant."
1.0,1008166-general,"A treat of a film, and Keaton at his physical and comical pinnacle. Some of the stunts are breath-taking, ingenious and much-copied. Quite possibly one of the best films ever made."
1.0,1008166-general,"The General is one of those films where you think to yourself ""I can't believe what I am seeing"" from beginning to end. Funny and awe-inspiring for its physical comedy."
1.0,1008166-general,"Very funny, probably now one of my all time favorites even though it is a silent film."
1.0,1008166-general,A fundamental film for the silent era.
1.0,1008166-general,"Watched a very entertaining movie last night: THE GENERAL (1927), starring Buster Keaton. An example of how good a silent film can be."
1.0,1008166-general,Brilliant silent film. Terrific chase sequences.
1.0,1008166-general,"Okyounger peeps. This is a film in monchrome AND with no words. Oh dear. Keaton's finest hour. See it, or your ""movie lover"" credentials sub-standard."
1.0,1008166-general,hALLERIOUSLY FUNNYsorry i meant this one not sure about the other! lol
1.0,1008166-general,Trop marant!!! au pire emprunter le moi!!
1.0,1008166-general,Very Funny. Keaton does his own stunts and they are very tough. It is a very good movie and is better than most of the comedies out there today.
1.0,1008166-general,Buster Keaton is adorable.
1.0,1008166-general,"Not all silent comedies are still funny in a modern context, but this one holds up."
1.0,1008166-general,Amazing Buster Keaton.....:D
1.0,1008166-general,An absoute masterpiece of storytelling the proves you don't need a lot of words to tell a perfect tale. A great choice for my first silent film!
1.0,1008166-general,Love all of Buster Keaton's work. Thank you Charles Ramirez Berg at UT Austin for telling me about this talented filmmaker/performer.
1.0,1008166-general,"I-JUST-ADORE-THIS-FILM!!! it is so amazing, hoe the narrative works, and the gags and all. its pure genius!!"
1.0,1008166-general,"Easily one of the funniest and most important comedies ever made. It doesn't just hold up today, but it continues to influence modern day films. ""The General"" is a classic and one of the best I've ever seen."
1.0,1008166-general,Keaton's physical comedy and stuntwork are spectacular and easily transcends the silent film genre as a great film for any era
1.0,1008166-general,"One of the most perfect comedies ever. I hurt from laughing everytime. Whenever this movie is on TCM, drop everything, I'm watching it."
1.0,1008166-general,"Amazing timing, humor and incredible stunts!"
1.0,1008166-general,The master at work in his finest film. A total joy from start to finish with some of the most inventive physical gags you'll ever see.
1.0,1008166-general,"Not only one of the best movies of the silent era, but one of the best ever. Buster Keaton's masterpeice. It would be doing this movie a disservice to categorize it solely as a comedy or as slapstick. Not only does this movie exemplify Keaton's atletic genius, but his pathos is on full display, too"
1.0,1008166-general,"The first silent film I ever saw. It single-handedly convinced me that silent films can be good, and that old films can still be very funny."
1.0,1008166-general,One of the greatest silent film of all time. brilliant movie.
1.0,1008166-general,A brilliant comedy featuring some amazing stunts.
1.0,1008166-general,"I know it's silent and B&W;, but the acting and the story transcend all time barriers that might keep you from this film. Absolutely amazing!"
1.0,1008166-general,"Brilliance, sheer brilliance."
1.0,1008166-general,"One of the greatest silent films of all time, the iconic Keaton crawling around on his runaway train is one of those sequences that must be seen."
1.0,1008166-general,"Absolute genius. They don't make them like this anymore (unfortunately) and for sheer athletic ability Keaton can't be beaten. The highlight is the sequence when feeling rejected he sits on the pistons, and suddenly looks around as the General starts to move."
1.0,1008166-general,What is this silly pict. over there? The REAL ONE is Keaton in front of train trying to stop it. Anyway General is the best thing came from silent period and Keaton is much more better than the small one with the funny hat.
1.0,1008166-general,One of my favourite all-time movies. Buster Keaton is a great underappreciated silent comic.
1.0,1008166-general,Perhaps my favorite movie of all time.
1.0,1008166-general,No CGI. No stunt man. How?
1.0,1008166-general,One of the best action movies ever made.
1.0,1008166-general,"Keaton's work is nothing short of phenomenal, and this film is truly extraordinary. An exciting, hilarious, and well-told story. Whenever I'm not laughing out loud, I have a big grin stuck to my face. Love it."
1.0,1008166-general,Buster Keaton at his best. Probably one of the best silent films ever made.
1.0,1008166-general,I can't believe this movie did so horrible when it released in 1927. Prob the best war comedy ever. Legit. This film once again justifies that Keaton is absolutely incredible.
1.0,1008166-general,"Best steam train chase sequence ever. BUSTER KEATON IS A GENIUS but I'm sure you know that already. If you don't, watch this film."
1.0,1008166-general,Thoroughly entertaining. It's tough not to fall in love with this movie.
1.0,1008166-general,easily the greatest American movie.
1.0,1008166-general,"Haha, underrated Actor that definitely needs to be up there with Chaplin"
1.0,1008166-general,A silent movie classic. Hugely watchable and entertaining. My 8-yr-old nephew loved it too!
1.0,1008166-general,"Buster Keaton fights to save his two loves, his girl and his locomotive, from being kidnapped by Union soldiers in this silent Civil War comedy classic. Forget Charlie Chaplin, Keaton was the best and funniest silent film star ever."
1.0,1008166-general,"Awesome. I loved every second of it. It is not laugh-out-loud funny (most of the time), but it is amazing to watch the master at work. This film is amazingly choreographed, better than I thought possible. Keaton is a comedy God!!!"
1.0,1008166-general,One of the most inspirational movies of all times. Buster Keaton is hilarious and brilliant at the same time!
1.0,1008166-general,"It's hard to believe this movie flopped when it opened in 1927. Like a lot of true masterpieces it needs time, perhaps years, for its full impact to be understood. The film making, camera work and story telling are lifted to another level here. Do yourself a favour and buy this DVD!"
1.0,1008166-general,A thing of joy and wonder.
1.0,1008166-general,one of the best films ever made. keaton is so incredibly athletic its MIND blowing. very very very very very very impressive for 1927 or even 2007 for that matter!
1.0,1008166-general,"Buster Keaton is so good. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this. Silent films usually get a bad rep. in today's world because they don't have words, but it's amazing how much can be conveyed just by actions and great acting."
1.0,1008166-general,Treinen zijn de shit.
1.0,1008166-general,Incredibly funny and amazingly choreographed.
1.0,1008166-general,"I think Keaton had it all over Chaplin, and The General proves it."
1.0,1008166-general,Buster Keaton was a genius!
1.0,1008166-general,"Well, this is very perfect in a ""action"" way... Not so good in a ""slapstick"" way. But that first phrase, gives this movie 5 start... No more, No less!  (Honestly, this is one of my favourit movies!)"
1.0,1008166-general,One of the best flicks of silent film. Action and physical humor!
1.0,1008166-general,"My first Keaton film. It's no City Lights, but it entertains and feels like a masterpiece."
1.0,1008166-general,"Awesome. The DVD-release with music by Joe Hisaishi makes it. If it was anyone other than Keaton in the role, it might be hard to stomach the fact that he's battling with (you can't stop me I'm part of the) Union."
1.0,1008166-general,brilliant. I'm crazy about keaton and this movie. the stunts are jaw dropping.
1.0,1008166-general,My favorite Keaton - his other-worldly qualities work so well in this film. There are many brilliant shots.
1.0,1008166-general,"A brilliant film. I remember studying this film in HS, and just being blown away by Buster Keaton. I realize that many people might pass on this one because it is a silent film, but it's really amazing."
1.0,1008166-general,"This is a brilliant film from start to finish. Brilliant well-filmed shots, incredible stunts and terrific timing, this is a must-see for anybody."
1.0,1008166-general,So great... Every kid should watch this movie at least once!
1.0,1008166-general,En av filmhistoriens höjdpunkter. Otroligt mästerverk!
1.0,1008166-general,"The film that made Buster Keaton a legend, The General is one of those unforgettable films that keeps on revealing more of itself after many repeated viewings. Some of the finest physical comedy ever filmed. Ranks up there with the best of Chaplin and Harold Lloyd."
1.0,1008166-general,buster keaton is my hero
1.0,1008166-general,A comedic masterpiece. If you ever hear anyone bash silent films just cos they're silent--shove this at 'em--it'll shut them up.
1.0,1008166-general,"Keaton's best comedy, and one of the funniest films you'll ever see."
1.0,1008166-general,Best by Buster Keaton - if you havent seen you must see it. Also it is interensting to see this movie as a war movie :)
1.0,1008166-general,FOR EN FILM! 1927! Tog og action med vist pÃ¥ en slik mÃ¥te at INGENTING overgÃ¥r denne! Og vraket han virkelig et damptog pÃ¥ den brua? DENNE BÃ?R DERE SE ALLE SAMMEN!
1.0,1008166-general,Buster Keaton's magnum opus.
1.0,1008166-general,"How did they do ridiculous stunts before wirework and CGI? Watch and learn, kiddies."
1.0,1008166-general,astoundingly good. . .watching Keaton on form is one of life's pleasures. . .genius
1.0,1008166-general,Fantastically hilarious!
1.0,1008166-general,"Quite possibly my favorite silent film. It has it all-romance, comedy, and action! It's one of those films everyone needs to see before they die."
1.0,1008166-general,"Hilarious movie. Not the funniest thing Keaton did, but it definitely shows off the full scope of his talent. How many other Civil War-era comedies exist? And how many comedies are willing to go all-out for a reanactment of a true story? Keaton's gags here are, as usual, amazing and daring."
1.0,1008166-general,Absolutely incredible In my top 10
1.0,1008166-general,"It may not be Keaton's funniest, but in terms of craft, it's certainly his finest. Most comedies work gags into the plot, this one uses gags to advance the plot. In my opinion, it is a perfect film comedy."
1.0,1008166-general,"a movie that defidently deserves to be considered on of the greatest screen comedies of all time, just as keaton deserves his place as one of the greatest directors of all time."
1.0,1008166-general,"Oh man, this movie is hilarious! I loved it. Buster Keaton is just amazing. That's all there is to it."
1.0,1008166-general,The greatest performance of the greatest early comedian. A funny and touching film.
1.0,1008166-general,This isn't just a comedy. It's a brilliant dramatic historical film based on a true story. Astounding stunts but also real depth.
1.0,1008166-general,An unbelievable genius! Keaton is my hero!
1.0,1008166-general,Vraiment drole et malade parce que les cascades sont toutes faites par Keaton et le train roule a une vitesse folle!
1.0,1008166-general,"Buster was an absolute genius and if you haven't seen this film, then you should really, really make the effort to!!"
1.0,1008166-general,This movie is insane. Every time someone sees this film for the first time - an angel gets its wings.
1.0,1008166-general,"avant, les clown n'avaient pas besoin de grimacer pour s'exprimer..."

1.0,1008166-general,Buster Keaton was such a lovable cutie as Johnny Gray. The girl didn't deserve him!
1.0,1008166-general,There's is not much of a plotline here- but who the f.... needs that when you're Keaton.
1.0,1008166-general,Buster Keaton is one of the finest actors/comedians in the world of cinema. I am in awe of his inventiveness and sense of comedy and storytelling ability.
1.0,1008166-general,"A good starting point for skeptics of silent films. Funny, emotional, exciting, and all silent. The set pieces and stunts are amazing, especially considering it was made 80 years ago."
1.0,1008166-general,"Buster Keaton's masterpiece of silent comedy. There are stunts in this film that to this day are still amazing and will have you wondering how it was done. Funny, funny, funny."
1.0,1008166-general,The best silent movie I have ever seen. Buster Keaton was a comic genius and this is one of the best examples of his work. I would chose a Keaton film over a Chaplin film anyday!

1.0,1008166-general,"Genius. Full of action and stunts, the film also continually subverts the worthiness of war with brilliant visual metaphors."
1.0,1008166-general,"hard to find words to describe this movie, loveable sums it up best I think. Keaton was not only a great athlete and director, but a true artist in a way rarely found in the cinema - wildly imaginative, technically ahead of his time (far!), and his films are still so human."
1.0,1008166-general,Good old fashioned BRILLIANCE.

1.0,1008166-general,"One of the best movies I have ever seen. I found myself wondering over and over, ""How did they do that?"" I mean things that are amazing now, and Buster did them back in 1927. Unbelievable."
1.0,1008166-general,"""Railroads are a great prop. You can do some awful wild things with railroads."" - Buster Keaton"

1.0,1008166-general,a gr8 funnty comedy=]
1.0,1008166-general,"An absolute classsic. The first silent film I ever saw, and it appeals to me at 35 as much as it did at 10. The dusty colonel scene is one of the all-time greats IMO. Beware of a recent Japanese remaster that has chopped scenes. get the original an put up with the quality."
1.0,1008166-general,"funny movie, great job by keaton who is clever and daring, he has that slapstick quality that make his stories clever"

1.0,1008166-general,Simply one of the funniest movies ever made. Brilliantly inventive.
1.0,1008166-general,"One of the greatest of all silent films. A symphony of movement. Keaton's immortal classic and his answer to Chaplin's self- pitying, but oh so ver y affecting, pathos. Priceless."
1.0,1008166-general,"If you've never seen a silent film, this is one of the best. Keaton plays a civil-war era train engineer in the deep south who saves the day. Keaton is an incredibly gifted physical comedian, and the elaborate timing of the visual gags will impress you."
1.0,1008166-general,"With all the CG and blue-screen bustle of today's big blockbusters, some of what you see in the General is hard to fathom and once you realize what you are seeing, it is truly incredible"
1.0,1008166-general,"One of the best movies ever made. Period. I love Buster Keaton, and this is an absolute classic. Incredibly funny, and with Keaton's amazing stunts and acrobatics."
1.0,1008166-general,The word genius is thrown around a lot and a lot of the time it's unwarranted. But with Buster Keaton it's more than fitting. Still one of the greatest comedy film makers and actors of all time and this is one of his best.
1.0,1008166-general,I want to be Buster Keaton. Genius.
1.0,1008166-general,"Wonderfully funny and clever, as well as a great adventure. A must-see-and-see-again film!"

1.0,1008166-general,keaton is the master. chaplin doesn't even come close and this is the film which proves it.
1.0,1008166-general,"Can you believe what this man does on screen. Chaplin's a better filmmaker, but Keaton's a better physical comedian."

1.0,1008166-general,Buster Keaton was amazing.
1.0,1008166-general,Simply superb. Keaton's masterpiece.
1.0,1008166-general,Le classique de Buster Keaton!
1.0,1008166-general,"Possibly one of the best silent comedies, or maybe just Buster's most realized feature length film. The gags are hilarious, Buster does some death-defying stunts, and when they need a train to crash into a river, they really crash a train. Proof they just don't make 'em like they used to."
1.0,1008166-general,Hilarious. Best watched with live music accompaniment (hi José!).
1.0,1008166-general,"Despite the fact this movie was made in 1927, it it one of the greatest comedies ever made, even one of the greatest films ever. Buster Keaton was a genius!"
1.0,1008166-general,"Possibly the greatest motion picture ever made, a brilliant action-comedy set against realistic Civil War background. The most dangerous, complicated sight gags imaginable, and Keaton manages to do everything himself on a moving train! The pacing couldn't be better."
1.0,1008166-general,best war comedy of all time? perhaps
1.0,1008166-general,How can you not love this movie? The funniest thing ever committed to film.
1.0,1008166-general,"Excellent. A must for action-comedy fans. Keaton preforms all his own stunts, and understands the important elements to good cinematic comedy."
1.0,1008166-general,"I hope that I will soon have another opportunity to write fully about this film. For now, suffice it to say that The General has taught me a lot about narrative structure in ways that so many literature classes have failed to do."
1.0,1008166-general,did all his own stunts great film
1.0,1008166-general,"Everyone should see this film, it is a great Buster Keaton Classic flick. I love the part when he gives the girl the picture of himself."
1.0,1008166-general,"One of the greatest, if not THE greatest action-comedies ever made. Buster does things with a locomotive that will bewilder and humble you. The great stoneface is at his finest here, in what's also hailed as one of the finest civil-war era reproductions ever filmed. Pure entertainment."
1.0,1008166-general,One of my favourite silent comedies.
1.0,1008166-general,"A miracle of timing, pace and construction. Must be seen to be believed."

1.0,1008166-general,"If you haven't seen this, you don't know movies!"
1.0,1008166-general,Obviously can't be judged by today's standards.
1.0,1008166-general,Buster Keaton was well before his time. His comedic genius lives! And I think Keaton owns over Chaplin.
1.0,1008166-general,"Great Movie! Low on authenticity, but another gut-buster by Old Stoneface!"
1.0,wings_of_desire,"A profOund exploration of innocence, love and existence inspired by the poEtry Of Erich Maria Remarque. The Artistry dIsplayed in this film is absolutely Jaw Dropping.

1.0,wings_of_desire,"A meditative work on what is human from the angel of angels. The Colombo actor adds a bit of vividness, but it is the Marion who captivates my attention."
1.0,wings_of_desire,A creative movie looking at German Berlin in the 80s without using the word Communism once. What better way to look at history than the eyes of timeless Angels.
1.0,wings_of_desire,"A black & white recommendation: if you are open to art and poetry in cinema, it is a must. If you just like Hollywood, miss it."
1.0,wings_of_desire,I give this a 100/A+.

1.0,wings_of_desire,The Divine Meditation
1.0,wings_of_desire,"If I had to pick one movie to see over and over this would be the one. Faithful translation of Rilke in spirt, aura and image."
1.0,wings_of_desire,"""Dedicated to all the former angels"""
1.0,wings_of_desire,"I think I fell in love with this movie first because I desire that it be true, and that the angels in which I do not believe believe in me, and second because it shares an aesthetic I had not yet uncovered in myself. I have often watched the first half alone, in search of solace of an unknown kind."
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Una gran lecciÃ³n de creatividad, profundidad , claridad y osadÃ­a fÃ­lmica. IncreÃ­ble la manera de conjugarlo todo sin raspar los lÃ­mites de la conciencia."
1.0,wings_of_desire,a great exemple of poetry in movies!
1.0,wings_of_desire,This film is poetry in motion. Breathtaking cinematography and a deeply moving meditation on humanity and the connections we make with each other.
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Probably the best film ever made. Also a record of a city and it's people and culture, West Berlin, that now only exists in the memory of those of us that were there at that time and in this film."
1.0,wings_of_desire,another good movie by Wim Wenders
1.0,wings_of_desire,A beautiful and complex masterpiece. A poetic film that I haven't completely understood yet but I am really looking forward to re-watching it. A worthwhile experience. So meticulously detailed and brilliant use of cinematography.
1.0,wings_of_desire,Wim Wender's offers his audience something of a lesson in Berlin's pyscho-geography alongside perhaps the most haunting protrayl of angels in film.
1.0,wings_of_desire,A stunningly simple yet beautiful film.

1.0,wings_of_desire,Magical....I got my Guardian Angel :)

1.0,wings_of_desire,"Again, Wim Wenders. Great."
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Wim Wenders has such a unique style. He had the visuals down in Paris, Texas, but he really nail everything with this. Very poetic. Whenever I find myself describing this film to someone, I almost want to cry."
1.0,wings_of_desire,good movie and very physiological but few years later Hollywood had to made a remake with Nicolas cage and meg Ryan
1.0,wings_of_desire,Needless to say it haunts more and more at every new viewing.
1.0,wings_of_desire,great mix of using color and black and white so many awesome moments in this

1.0,wings_of_desire,One of the most beautiful German movies I have ever seen!
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Wim Wenders finds means to say something that could not have been siad otherwise. It's a film about material, immaterial and the relationship in between."
1.0,wings_of_desire,I'd give up forever to touch you.
1.0,wings_of_desire,"The sequence with the author & thinker walking through Berlin, thinking about the damaged city along with the love vested in the color portion with the trapeze dancer are two points of extremely distinct grace that are surprising to find in one film."
1.0,wings_of_desire,Best movie EVER. Fact.

1.0,wings_of_desire,A truly amazing piece of cinema.
1.0,wings_of_desire,Fantastisk! Betongpornografi.
0.0,wings_of_desire,"This is the dumbest movie I've ever seen. I turned it off after 20 minutes of ""dummes, belangloses Zeug"". I'm not interested in hearing people's inner thoughts or to angels speak calmly about ""becoming humans""."
1.0,wings_of_desire,possibly my favorite all time film
1.0,wings_of_desire,watched this yet again last night because i just recently got it on criterion collection blu-ray. among the greatest ever.
1.0,wings_of_desire,"In many ways, the finest film of the 80's...perhaps ever."
1.0,wings_of_desire,i love this movie it so good
0.0,wings_of_desire,"Apparently, this is a classic. I actually fell asleep whilst watching it and woke up to find - to my disappointment- that it was still on. A shame, as Wender's 'Paris Texas' is one of my favourite films."
1.0,wings_of_desire,A very moving elegy about the yearnings of all of the inhabitants in a divided world. It's also one of the most truly romantic films I seen in how an angel is willing to give up his wings and immortality to be with the woman he loves. A film that truly stays with you.
1.0,wings_of_desire,The true value of the gift of humanity is both a sadness and a joy. (Wim Wenders is quickly becoming one of my new favorite filmmakers.)
1.0,wings_of_desire,Its film or poetry? I never felt this feeling before.........thank you Wenders
1.0,wings_of_desire,"It's not a film for everyone. Too artsy for some and too slow for others, but if you give it a chance, you're in for one of the finest films from any country, in any language. I didn't get into it at first, but once I started to understand this world of angels, it really started to grab me."
1.0,wings_of_desire,its an out of the world movie!! an outstanding experience!!
1.0,wings_of_desire,My all-time favorite film.
1.0,wings_of_desire,i say only one thing: scene in library!
1.0,wings_of_desire,A grand reunification tale.
1.0,wings_of_desire,Very few scenes ever captivated me more than watching the late Solveig Dommartin swinging herself with such enchantment in the trapeze while being watched by an angel in black and white.
1.0,wings_of_desire,Not so much a movie as it is a visual experience. It takes a director with real talent to create real emotions without having to use dialogue. Wim Wenders is that talent.
1.0,wings_of_desire,"beautiful film with a beautiful story, beautiful cinematography, beautiful words, beautiful style, and beautiful scenes.,Why am I me and why not you? Why am I here watching this movie and why not there doing something else? sure god couldn't have been more nicer to me.."
1.0,wings_of_desire,"a beautiful, mesmerising, haunting, lovely, poetic film that captivates you from the start. Bruno Ganz is perfect as the Angel who falls in love with a mortal.  Peter Falk adds an extra dimension - a great addition to the film."
1.0,wings_of_desire,Just saw this on the big screen for the first time. Love it.
1.0,wings_of_desire,This film is indescribable. Just reading the director's original pitch barely does the film justice. It has to be experienced.
1.0,wings_of_desire,"One of my all-time favorites. It's definitely the sort film that has to be watched without distraction and if you are looking to be spoon-fed a storyline, I'd keep looking. It's the sort of film that drifts, leaving it up to you to follow along."
0.0,wings_of_desire,The German version of City of Angels. I skipped and forwarded my way through it. Some poignant moments and I do understand what they were trying to do. I like the fact that it makes you feel for the struggles of mankind without the sappy ending.
1.0,wings_of_desire,Second best movie of all history
1.0,wings_of_desire,If I ever see this again I'm sure I will like it even more. The arthouse style is not that familiar to me so it took some time to get used to the pacing and style. The only thing that bothered me was Marion's monologue in the end. Seemed misplaced a bit.
1.0,wings_of_desire,the closest i've seen film come to poetry
1.0,wings_of_desire,"""Las alas del deseo"" Una hermosísima película de Win Wenders; la primera parte de ""Tan cerca, tan lejos""."

1.0,wings_of_desire,a sweet analysis of human complexity

1.0,wings_of_desire,Beautiful. Achingly beautiful. All elements of this movie come together and present a wonderful celebration of life and all the little simple great things about it.
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Formidable, magnifico, an fear and any other words that come to mind in any country."
1.0,wings_of_desire,A haunting and atmospheric masterpiece. This film gets you into the head of an angel. It really makes you rethink all of the glorious little details of life. I loved it.

1.0,wings_of_desire,A beautiful film. The constant camera movements capture a sureal and unearthly character which was perfect for the film. Nothing about the black and white to colour and back feels trite. Everything about it works in every way. Could have easily been boring but instead is pure genius.

1.0,wings_of_desire,"Para mi, el mejor filme jamas creado; el poema de lo que significa ser humano, ante los ojos de un angel. Es el concepto original de ""City of Angels""."

1.0,wings_of_desire,Nick Cave was a nice surprise oh and it was a beautiful film
1.0,wings_of_desire,"I love this movie--it's moving and surreal and City of Angels is only superficially a ""remake"" of it. Los Angeles is not a stand-in for Berlin at the eve of the fall of the wall."

1.0,wings_of_desire,"One of THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FILMS EVER MADE. I watched this in my German class when I was 15 and it still haunts me. The dialogue is so beautiful written, it's so delicately crafted, yet incredibly passionate."
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Bruno Ganz as an inquisitive angel, perhaps, but Peter Falk? What is this German fasination with Colombo????"
1.0,wings_of_desire,Bruno Ganz and Peter Falk at their best - being immortal has its drawbacks...

1.0,wings_of_desire,"A fascinatingly inscrutable parable...in this movie you will be a bystander, looking through a window, with your own thoughts and ideas a part of the movie, not the other way around. If you're not ready to go there, don't bother watching."

1.0,wings_of_desire,If I crashed on a deserted island and managed to save the DVD reader this is the movie I wish to have with me!
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Yep. Still love it. Still love Peter Falk, still love Wim Wenders, still love it. Even the long talkey scenes. And the DVD has the deleted pie fight scene, which even cracks Wenders up. That's worth the price of admission alone."
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Great cinematography especially in the library (is that me being biased?) and Nick Cave crops up in it, and columbo. Prefer the black and white but thats just me. Going to watch to Faraway so close soon despite its u2 connections."

1.0,wings_of_desire,Exquisite. Some films are perfect. How anyone was persuaded to try the dire copy 'City Of Angels' is beyond me. Sureley they know that re-make was a suicide mission.

1.0,wings_of_desire,"This was a great movie! It's very slow-paced, which suits me. It's consistent within its rules, too. And when the recent variation came out, this one seemed only so much better. I love Meg Ryan and I like Nicholas Cage but... yeesh. Someone should smack the writers hard."

1.0,wings_of_desire,Possibly the best movie of all time...
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Beautifully filmed, stately, and deeply emotional, it's a profound meditation on immortality that draws us into its quiet, sepia toned world, surrounding us with plaintive violins, pained faces, and poignant words. A true classic."

1.0,big_night,"This is one of the movies you see once and enjoy, then see again and fall in love with.

0.0,up_in_the_air_2009,This movie was complete shit.
1.0,up_in_the_air_2009,Wonderfully done comedy - drama has more to it than one might think. The nastiness of the job being done by Clooney and his pupal may turn off those who have been fired by such characters. On Blu-Ray.

0.0,up_in_the_air_2009,Anna Kendrick is excellent. Clooney is awful. There is no real conclusion or proper ending to the movie. i watched the end 4 times and still had no conclusion. Bad directing and writing. I do not like movies with the Ugly Clooney.

1.0,up_in_the_air_2009,"Sin duda jason reitman aplico todo su esfuerzo para que esta pelicula romantica progresara con un elenco de primera, en mi punto es una de las pocas peliculas con un buen guion. La emocion de esta pelicula te hace hasta ver las estrellas."

And in the end so completely tragic, almost absurd."

1.0,1007931-from_here_to_eternity,"A solid plot stems off into a whole lot of interesting subplots, with great performances all around. This is a landmark war film. Frank Sinatra is particularly fantastic, and Zinnemann's direction makes this an absolutely breathtaking epic."
1.0,1007931-from_here_to_eternity,Just a classic with a superb cast!
1.0,1007931-from_here_to_eternity,"Simply put From Here to Eternity is the story of love found, love lost and eventually loved killed. The coming of war is evident here, but that is not what is focused on, rather it is the love and friendships that are manifest on the base. The famous base is of course that of Pearl Harbor."
1.0,1007931-from_here_to_eternity,you don't like weakness do you?
0.0,1007931-from_here_to_eternity,This movie just blew.

1.0,1007931-from_here_to_eternity,Classic. Sinatra is a stand-out.
1.0,hustler,one of the all time greats
1.0,hustler,Definitely one of the best movies of it's time. Pool became so popular with pool rooms/billiard parlors springing up all over the country even in many bowling alleys because of this movie. About 15 years later many were closed as the interest dwindled.
1.0,hustler,"Movie about a pool shark who knows he can beat his idol, Minnesota Fats. Complex movie about more than just pool playing. Newman's star making role. What a performance. One of my all time favorites."
1.0,hustler,A fantastic cast giving stellar performances.
1.0,hustler,"One of the best Newman characterizations ever. A hard hitting story about loss and consequences wrapped in the shady, roguish veneer of pool hall life."
1.0,hustler,Just exquisite. Really loved it.
0.0,hustler,I don't remember the last time I was ever this bored.
1.0,hustler,"Fast Eddie vs Minnesota Fats. A more intense drama I had never seen. Newman in one of his most iconic roles. Ups, downs. A classic must watch"
1.0,hustler,"A wonderful film not about pool but about, yes, character. Newman, Gleeson, Scott and Laurie all deliver indelible performances, seeping complex psychology and humanity into wonderful style."
1.0,hustler,"Awesome movie! Great acting, great story, great everything. t was very intriguing, very entertaining, and just fun to watch."
1.0,hustler,"The power of Robert Rossen's realistic depiction of obsession, addiction and arrogance has only grown more intense with time. Paul Newman, Jackie Gleason and Piper Laurie deliver performances so ahead of their time and the level of surprising tension is almost unrelenting. A perfect movie."
1.0,hustler,"Arguably the greatest sports movie ever, this film quickly devolves into a dark character study of a rolling stone pool shark subconsciously hellbent on destroying himself and the few who love him, including a fragile alcoholic cripple with delusions of romance."
1.0,hustler,Would never have been interested in a Tom cruise movie if not for this. The color of money
1.0,hustler,"Wow!!! What an incredibly good movie. They don't make them like this any more. Fabulous acting, great story."
1.0,hustler,"No es tan mala como la pintaban las criticas , pero tampoco es una magnifica pela , en fin un film de suspenso que cumple su cometido , asi me quedo con la version original de los cincuentas que es incomparabe y en blanco y negro."
1.0,hustler,"A tour-de-force classic, and possibly the only movie to make billiards cinematically interesting."
1.0,hustler,wow! Not sure why I didn't watch this movie sooner. wow!
1.0,hustler,"boosted by a phenomenal performance from Newman in one of his iconic role, the hustler is a fantastic classic about morality and redemption, this is a must see for any movie buffs if not just for the exciting billards scenes and great performances"
1.0,hustler,"Paul Newman as a shark, Jackie Gleason as Minnesots Fats, and Georgr C Scott as a gambling kingpin. A classic by any standard."
1.0,hustler,Undeniably the greatest movie ever made about the sport of pool. The acting is excellent.
1.0,hustler,The highest rated movie in every aspect. The best Newman's performance. Never dying classic.
1.0,hustler,Impresivno. Potpuni uitak je gledati ga...
1.0,hustler,"The Hustler is a murky, ethically multi-layered story of revitalization, with entire sequences that feel so real and performances that have become the stuff of legend."
1.0,hustler,"Aparentemente parece apenas um filme simples sobre sinuca, mas com horas de jogo e boas doses de whisky, percebemos que se trata de um fascinante estudo de personagens! Scott, Gleason e Newman estão simplesmente perfeitos em cena."
1.0,hustler,The best I've seen Paul Newman in.
1.0,hustler,"Great performances and a great and thought provoking script give moral weight to this film and the cast just gives a stellar performance all around. A telling tale of what arrogance and pride can do if you let it control you, no matter your skill or prowess."
1.0,hustler,"Classic on mishandling and over-appreciating your own talent. This is the prequel to ""Color of Money"" with appearances by several legends of the billiard parlors."
1.0,hustler,Fantastic flick! Great acting and story.
1.0,hustler,What a gorgeous piece of black and white cinema this is! Paul Newman is fantastic alongside George C. Scott and Jackie Gleason. Cannot wait to watch 'The Color of Money' again now that I've finally seen this!

1.0,hustler,Love everything about this movie.
1.0,hustler,"Paul Newman is at his best as a young pool hustler who takes on the champion, Minnesota Fats, played perfectly by Jackie Gleason. George C. Scott plays a great villain; also in the movie are Piper Laurie and Myron McCormack. Great script, great acting."
1.0,hustler,Jack Gleason and Paul Newman at there best!!!
1.0,hustler,Fruktansvärt bra film.
1.0,hustler,possible a perfect movie
1.0,hustler,"What to talk about a movie that just reflects in his first moments of the peak performance of the great Paul Newman as the player pool drunk and egocentric, accompanied by an engaging soundtrack, photography and direction idens?!"
1.0,hustler,"this is so much more then a pool movie, paul newmans acting is amzing as fast eddie and jackie gleason as minnesota fats did a gat job and the ending scene with him and newman was the geatest part. Gorge c scott did a great job as well but i liked newman and gleason more"
1.0,hustler,One of my top films of all time.
1.0,hustler,Top-Notch Newman and Jackie Gleeson is hypnotic to watch.
1.0,hustler,Paul Newman gives an electrifying performance in this sublime and smoky character study.
1.0,hustler,this movie got me shooting pool in the first place!
1.0,hustler,"With Paul Newman you always know you'll have a great film, but this one really did a great job of examining human nature, and his performance especially stood out."
1.0,hustler,Brilliant acting and storytelling.
1.0,hustler,god they sure dont make em like they used to huh. paul newman may seriously be my favorite actor of all time. the guy just pours himself out in this movie. i wish movies today could do this.
1.0,hustler,"Gleason plays it straight, Newman is great."
1.0,hustler,new 2nd or 1A movie plus Gleason and Scott in it....awesome
1.0,hustler,Probably the best movie about gambling and it's effects. Paul Newman and George C. Scott are amazing and I can't imagine Newman being better than he is here. The pool scenes are filmmaking perfection. A must see for sure.
1.0,hustler,"By far my favorite Newman flick. A morality play of so many layers, played out on a pool table. If you think this is about pool, then you've been hustled."
1.0,hustler,one of the greatest films i've ever seen.
1.0,hustler,"An brilliant film.. Probably my favorite movie of all time. Fast eddie goes on a journey to find Fats Minnesota but he really finds life. Awsome performances from Scott, Gleason, Laurie and Newman. A must see"
1.0,hustler,"Most people will tell you that ""The Godfather"" is the best movie ever made. Those people haven't seen ""The Hustler"". Paul Newman delivers possibly the best performance of all time while Jackie Gleason solidifies the legend of Minnesota Fats."
1.0,hustler,every character sparks here. one of the best of Paul Newman.
1.0,hustler,"Memorable y amargo drama, uno de los mejores que he visto en mi vida, todos los actores en estado de gracia, de visiÃ²n obligatoria."
1.0,hustler,"Interesting character study of three individuals living life in the corners of a subculture few ever see. It's a microcosm , however, of society at large really.. But these characters are just more honest... More real."
1.0,hustler,one of my fave movies.
1.0,hustler,Amazing performances in this classic movie. It shows why Newman was one of the best actors that ever lived.
1.0,hustler,One of the best. Gotta love Paul Newman too : )

1.0,hustler,"I am so upset I saw Poolhall Junkies first.. this was film at it's absolute finest. I loved every aspect of this movie, the relationship, the pool playing, that one scene where Newman was talkin' about jobs ... classic."
1.0,hustler,A moment in this film stuck with me for over 20 years: There is a big difference in KNOWING you can do something and actually DOING it.
1.0,hustler,A moment in this film stuck with me for over 20 years: There is a big difference in KNOWING you can do something and actually DOING it.
1.0,hustler,"Definitely my top 10 movies of all time, has anyone else seen it? Gotta love a young Paul Newman, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid up there as well! If you haven't seen either of these classics get with the times!!!"
1.0,hustler,new 2nd or 1A movie plus Gleason and Scott in it....awesome
1.0,hustler,"Robert Rossen's best movie by a comfortable mile and an outstanding and brilliant performance by the great Paul Newman. It was a shame that Newman hat to wait until ""The Color Of Money"" to win his first Oscar. Incredible."
1.0,hustler,Solid performances from some of Hollywood's best!
1.0,hustler,A great film by Robert Rossen who seems to have a knack for the game of pool hustling and dingy drinking bars. Paul Newman plays the unforgettable Eddie Felson who challenges the dangerous yet brilliant pool hustler Minnesota Fats(Jackie Gleason) A must see for pool fans.
1.0,hustler,"Loved this film, classic American Cinema!! A very slow film in terms of the story but it's perfectly formed and throughly enjoyable. The cinematography is gorgeous as well! Newman is a legend! A must watch!"
1.0,hustler,Three great performances in acting are on film here! a must see if you like pool as well
1.0,hustler,"a wonderful allegory about staying classy, no matter how much life craps on you."
1.0,hustler,"They're all wonderful in this gritty portrayal of the reality on an old-time pool hustler, but Piper Laurie delivers a stellar performance."
1.0,hustler,"A classic. An engrossing, brave film, much, much darker than I expected from the era."
1.0,hustler,loved it .. i think this movie was what made me like pool as much as i do..
1.0,hustler,Very stylish early 60's film with great performances by Paul Newman and Gerald Gleason.
1.0,hustler,a cool pool film....
1.0,hustler,One of Paul Newman's best works.
1.0,hustler,A must see. Jackie Gleason portrayal of Minesota Fats was spectacular. Fast Eddie Felson is a great character that only Paul Newman could play.
1.0,hustler,You know it's good when Scorsese himself wants to helm the sequel. This is an absolutely terrific movie.
1.0,hustler,Total classic. How i love Paul Newman. (sigh)
1.0,hustler,this movie got me shooting pool in the first place!
1.0,hustler,Fast Eddie is awesome!

1.0,hustler,"With his Oscar-worthy performance, Paul Newman shows us the true meaning of winning and losing and how little money matters when compared to pride, happiness and, most importantly, love."
1.0,hustler,Paul Newman gives a great performance and the editing in this film is good as well. The pool scenes are well filmed as well
1.0,hustler,It will make you want to take off the shirt you were watching when you saw it and hang it up like a trophy moose head...It's that damn good. Amazing performances all-around and an incredible final scene.
1.0,hustler,"A slick and suave sports movie with Newman as the perfect leading man. Not just your average, predictable sports drama - this is deeper and more complex."
1.0,hustler,This movie is a classic.I watched it many times and it has an never will be a boring movie.
1.0,hustler,Top-Notch Newman and Jackie Gleeson is hypnotic to watch.
0.0,hustler,Easily one of the most boring movies EVER! I can't see how this is such a famous movie? Way let down.
1.0,hustler,Paul Newman...there is no one better...
1.0,hustler,One of the best movies I have ever seen.
1.0,hustler,"*I'm the best there is fats, best there is, even if you beat me i'm still the best* Paul Newman nails this up in the sky, absolute top rate classic."
1.0,hustler,"Great movie , great cast top 10 in my list"
1.0,hustler,"With his Oscar-worthy performance, Paul Newman shows us the true meaning of winning and losing and how little money matters when compared to pride, happiness and, most importantly, love."
0.0,hustler,Not my favorite Newman movie. Too much nasty intrigue. Slow and tedious
1.0,hustler,"this is so much more then a pool movie, paul newmans acting is amzing as fast eddie and jackie gleason as minnesota fats did a gat job and the ending scene with him and newman was the geatest part. Gorge c scott did a great job as well but i liked newman and gleason more"
1.0,hustler,The best movie.... EVER
1.0,hustler,"Beautifully filmed and with wonderful performances by Newman, C. Scott and Laurie. Classic American Cinema that's hard to beat!"
1.0,hustler,"For anyone who LOVES pool, this film is a classic. Don't be fooled by the box, this one is in black and white."
1.0,hustler,Not too much to say about this that hasn't been said. Hard to believe this was made in 1961. Perfect.
1.0,hustler,they just don't make 'em like this anymore.
1.0,hustler,"EXCELLENT MOVIE, PAUL AS USUALLY GREAT ACTOR!"
1.0,hustler,This is a good moviePlot: An up-and-coming pool player plays a long-time champion in a single high-stakes match.
1.0,hustler,"This is a really heavy film, and not what I thought it was going to be. As much about human weakness and loneliness as it is about pool. An all time classic, but very sad."
1.0,hustler,"Never thought i'd would enjoy a 'classic' but i loved this movie. Paul Newmans character 'fast eddie felson' had balls. The love story was amazing, and dysfunctional. I was glued to the screen the entire time."
1.0,hustler,Paul Newman puts on the best performance of all time in my opinion as the young Fast Eddie Felson.
1.0,hustler,"""you look beautiful, fats. just beautiful'. greatness that takes its time. paul newman hustles, and it's joyful watching. jackie gleason is perfect, and george c. scott is terrifyingly evil without lifting a finger."
1.0,hustler,"Bert Gordon: ""I don't think there's a pool player alive shoots better pool than I saw you shoot the other night at Ames. You got talent... ""Fast Eddie: ""So I got talent. So what beat me? ""Bert Gordon: ""Character."""
1.0,hustler,one of the best diolog in the world
1.0,hustler,"Paul Newman is so handsome.. slim, mean yet natural body..."
1.0,hustler,"Just fell in love with this film after 10 minutes. Funny, dark and gritty. Newman's greatest role as Fast Eddie Felson."
1.0,hustler,"amazing. the acting, directing and writing is dead-on. loved it."
1.0,hustler,"Paul Newman's iconic performance, this film stands the test of time. Amazing, script, amazing acting.....what great filmmaking is all about."
1.0,hustler,"Brilliant, brilliant film."
1.0,hustler,"Part of Paul Newman's excellent run of 60's films and probably the best of them. One of cinema's most profound character studies. Great work by Piper Laurie, George C. Scott, and Jackie Gleason as well."
1.0,hustler,"Man, they don't write 'em like that anymore... Great commentary on our internal conflicts, what we can and can't change about ourselves, the difference between aspiration to greatness and bullying of the weak. Just for the tip of the iceberg. Very cerebral, but subtly so."
1.0,hustler,"Eddie, you're a born loser."
1.0,hustler,"Of course Paul Newman was excellent in this, as is the other great actors like: George C. Scott, and Jackie Gleason, Truly a terrific film you gotta see."
1.0,hustler,Fast Eddie Felson (Newman) is a pool hustler. What makes this film great is Jackie Gleason as Minnesota Fats. A must see film.
1.0,hustler,"Brilliant movie about winners and losers, why we fight and what we hope to gain. Great script and titanic performances from Paul Newman, Piper Laurie and George C. Scott."
1.0,hustler,"Damn, I wish I shot pool as well as any of these guys, but I sadly my skill at pool begins at ends with applying the chalk. A great film to remember Paul Newman by though."
1.0,hustler,"Paul Newman's ascent into the pantheon began here in Rosson's electrifying, sleazy and disturbing portrait of addiction and despair. Fast Eddie is a portrait of male ego for the ages and, if you can cope with the crash, it's hypnotic viewing..."
1.0,hustler,"such a great movie with great performances by Paul Newman,George C Scott and Jackie Gleason. loved it."
1.0,hustler,"Paul Newman's greatest performance, throw in Jackie Gleason, George C. Scott and you got a true classic."

1.0,hustler,"Top films ever, without a doubt. Paul Newman - never better, Piper Laurie - heart breaking, George C. Scott - best villain, Jackie Gleason - his best performance"
1.0,hustler,"supurb acting and beautiful directing, really makes you want to watch it and enjoy it"
1.0,hustler,Terrific from beginning to end. Great use of cinemascope.
1.0,hustler,Probably my favortie Paul Newman movie ever. Several well deserved Oscar nominations including Piper Laurie's performance. Quality movie to the end.
1.0,hustler,Paul Newman is pretty much the coolest guy ever.
1.0,hustler,"What a great movie. You can really understand why Paul Newman is such a great actor. You might think this is predictable from the first 30 minutes, but it has some great twists."
1.0,hustler,"Whether you love Newman, Gleason, Pool, or a good B/W movie, this is where its at. One of the greats, a truly classic film."
1.0,hustler,Fast Eddie lets play some pool.
1.0,hustler,"Newman has never been better, and Gleason does a great turn as Minnesota Fats."
1.0,hustler,wow this was the greatest acting i have ever seen. Paul newman was amazing great story great cast a must see loved the ending i am still in awe of this moving dont know why i never seen this till now.
1.0,hustler,"Flawless performances and is the best movie about pool. In my opinion, Newman's best performance."
1.0,hustler,It's brilliant and Paul Newman is the coolest man on earth...
1.0,hustler,Movie masterpiece starring the master of movies.
1.0,hustler,"If you think this movie has anything to do with playing pool, you've missed the point."
1.0,hustler,What Tom Cruise aspired to in the sequel.Newman is the master!
1.0,hustler,"Classic Newman flick, and a very underrated performance by George C. Scott."
1.0,hustler,One of the best movies of all time.
1.0,hustler,Too close to call between this and Cuckoo's Nest - to be Fast Eddie or McMurphy? Few movie characters to me are iconic - these are 2.
1.0,hustler,Paul Newman in his prime...
1.0,hustler,"super good flick. absolutly love this story of ""fast"" eddie felson and the dark world of pool hustling."
1.0,hustler,"Newman, Gleason, Scott, Laurie... All of them deliver with unmatched skill here. You don't need to know pool or gambling, you just need to know what it's like to get kicked when you're down and you'll love this movie."
1.0,hustler,"The absolute role of Paul Newman.The personal voyage of a man through the streets of semi-outlaw activieties and the parasitic way of life until his initiation and self-knowledge ,a slow sleepy trip in the dark tunnels of human subconscious"
1.0,hustler,Paul Newman is magnetic. And the cinematography really brings out the story
1.0,hustler,"A true classic. Sparse, yet incredibly effective. Newman and George C. Scott are amazing in the final scene!"
1.0,hustler,Great movie overall. If you like this one watch Poolhall Junkies its pretty much a modern version.
1.0,hustler,"Loved The Color of Money too, but the just don't write movies with the anguish and reality and depth of character like they did in the time The Hustler was written. Paul Newman is a legand and made this deeply disturbing masterpiece the classic that it is."
1.0,hustler,still as good as ever!!
1.0,hustler,"How come this movie only win two Oscars out of 9 Nominations? For cinematography and sets??!! Paul Newman, Jackie Gleason, Piper Laurie and George C. Scott give tremendous performances and all were nominated for Oscars but didn't win. They deserved to."
1.0,hustler,Quite possibly one of the coolest movies ever made. The Hustler combines the style and swagger of film noir with the drama of Greek tragedy. As a bonus you also get some amazing pool sequences. Broken lives portrayed with beauty.
1.0,hustler,Class!!! Arguably Newman's best performance and hugely entertaining.
1.0,hustler,"Maybe the best part of this movie is Jackie Gleason as the menacing Minnesota Fats, the pool legend. Paul Newman is incredible as ""Fast Eddie"" as is George C. Scott as Newman's handler."
1.0,hustler,"Really, really good."
1.0,hustler,"Arguably Newman's finest film (there's some stiff competition from such a Hollywood giant) this makes the 'must-see before you die' list of all but the retarded. Infinitely superior to the later Tom Cruise vehicle ""The Colour of Money"" in which Newman reprised his role as Fast Eddie Felson."
1.0,hustler,also another amazing bit of cinema what can i say newman is a legend
1.0,hustler,"If he was going to win his Oscar playing Fast Eddie, I wish he would have won for this movie. What a cast, what a performance."
1.0,hustler,5 cherries a REAL CLASSIC!!
1.0,hustler,"Classic, What Else Is There to say"
1.0,hustler,this is totally deadly.
1.0,hustler,"A fantastic movie that I waited way too long to see. Paul Newman gives one of the best performances I have ever seen, and just absolutely kills the surprising ending. The thing that puts this movie over the top though is the depth of its pool and life metaphor."
1.0,hustler,the ultimste pool movie
1.0,hustler,"Probably my fav film of all time, probably not to everyones taste but an absolute masterpeice. Paul Newman is great but the star for me is Jackie Gleesen"
1.0,hustler,I HIGH RECOMEND THIS MOIVE TO ALL
1.0,hustler,Proof positive that a movie rests on the shoulders of its actors.
1.0,hustler,"greatest pool movie ever made. the whole cast is exceptional, i shouldnt even have to tell you how good this movie is, you should already know"
1.0,hustler,"Fast Eddie: Fat man, you shoot a great game of pool. Minnesota Fats: So do you, Fast Eddie."
1.0,hustler,By far one of the coolest movies ever made. Paul Newmans Charisma is unbeatable.
1.0,hustler,If you have ever played pool and really thought about the game this is must watch
1.0,hustler,"Classic, Newman is amazing and so is everybody around him. Weird how a movie about morality and selling your soul can be based around pool. Fantastic script, has to be one of the best ever written."
1.0,hustler,"Who dares to challenge the Fats, none other than ""fast"" eddie felson, a must see to understand the ending of the other movie ""the color of money"" with paul newman and tom cruise"
1.0,hustler,"I really enjoyed this. Paul Newman excels in this type of role, actors of his quality that exude charisma are rare indeed. They just don't make quality movies like this nowadays..."
1.0,hustler,"This was amazing. What a great movie! When I first got this, I thought it was a sequel to The Sting, and I confused it with The Color of Money, which turns out to have been a sequel to THIS. Anyway, this was excellent."
1.0,hustler,Great movie for anybody that knows pool
1.0,hustler,"A film about pool that's not really about pool; if your only knowledge of Jackie Gleason is as the sheriff in ""Smokey and the Bandit"", then check out this. Everyone - EVERYONE - in this film. is simply acting out of their socks."
1.0,hustler,"one of my favorite movies, Paul Newman couldn't have performed better, this movie also inspired me to learn pool :)"
1.0,hustler,"An all time favorite! A very deep and sad tale of greed, lust and fear. Jackie Gleason as the part of Fats is a gem..and he shoots his own stick in this one! Check it out."
1.0,hustler,J.T.S. Brown...One of Newman's best..a MUST See
1.0,hustler,"The prequel to The Color Of Money"" but you really shouldn't mention the 2 in the same sentance. Newman rules yet again!"
1.0,hustler,"I'm shootin' pool, Fats. When I miss, you can shoot."
1.0,hustler,"what a classic! i think this was one of the favorite's from the early 60's... the colour of money dosn't even come close! & a little trivia for you, did you know that jackie gleason was jason patrick's grandfather? anyway, i love this movie, & it's a bonus in b/w"
1.0,hustler,a fuckin masterpiece
1.0,hustler,"the best movie about being a gambler...(Bob Le FLambeur, Color of Money, Rounders...nothing comes close)"
1.0,hustler,One of the all time great movies.

1.0,hustler,"""I don't rattle kid, and just for tryin', I'm gonna beat you flat!"""
1.0,hustler,"Just brilliant. Newman unbeatble, Jackie Gleason's probably best performance. The whole film is a masterpiece unique: the script, rythm..."
1.0,hustler,"Incredible movie! Paul Newman + Jackie Gleason = instant billiards classic. The sequel, The Color of Money, isn't bad either, considering it's an early Tom Cruise movie before he went bat-shit nutty."
1.0,hustler,First watch for me and not what I expected. I tend not to read about films that I haven't seen so that I can experience them in as fresh a way as I can and I am very glad that I'd avoided finding out what this film was about. To say that I was taken by surprise would be an understatement. Brilliant.
1.0,hustler,Amazing acting all around!
1.0,hustler,"newman, gleason, george c. scott, they don't makem like this anymore, classic"
1.0,hustler,"The very definition of a character study movie. Paul Newman gives one hell of a performance in his most iconic role. Great atmosphere and assured direction. All the performances from the entire cast is flawless, George C. Scott is especially astonishing as a ruthless gambler."
1.0,hustler,Newman. Gleason. Scott. The most stylish pool movie ever. Its a winning shot. Take it.
1.0,hustler,"Newman, Gleason and Scott do more with meaningful looks in any one scene in this movie than most movies accomplish in a full script."
1.0,hustler,"Not sure why you would only see one Paul Newman Movie, but if you did, this would be the one. George C. Scott and Piper Laurie both are up the challenge of hanging with Mr. Newman. Rossen's direction is pitch perfect."
1.0,hustler,fed film! den har det hele
1.0,hustler,Can't get any better than the romanticism of black & white and one man's struggle to find who he is all while trying to make some skins
1.0,hustler,"One of the greatest character driven tragedies to ever grace the screen. Amazing Performances from Newman, Gleason, Laurie, and Scott."
1.0,hustler,Dirty and dark movie

1.0,hustler,"""Shoot pool Fast Eddie.""""I am shooting pool, Fats. When I get done, you can shoot.""Another Marxist parable from Robert Rossen (Body & Soul). Another masterpiece."
1.0,hustler,"An amazing classic. Tragic, but amazing."
1.0,hustler,Doesn't get much better than this for the actors and for the story line. Can't see it enough times.
1.0,hustler,"It's all about Paul Newman, and his best movie ever. A man fighting his demons and obssessions. Fighting for control of his life and destiny while trying to live life just for the game."
1.0,hustler,"Paul Newman just can't get any cooler than as ""Fast"" Eddie Felson. If you like pool, than this movie is required viewing."
1.0,hustler,"truly great, also has some fun shots in it."
1.0,hustler,paul newman is the man in this film he's never been better by the end of the film u wana b fast eddie
1.0,hustler,Just watched this classic. Thrilling!
1.0,hustler,Paul Newman gives a career defining performance in this movie and it is a shame that he did not get rewarded for his excellence until he reprised the role in The Color of Money. I loved the pool marathon and thought that Jackie Gleason and George C. Scott were magnificent.
1.0,hustler,Pretty much anything with Paul Newman gets 5 Stars in my book. The man is a god. Simple as that my friends.
1.0,hustler,EXCELLENT both Paul Newman and Jackie Gleason were great!

1.0,hustler,"Paul Newman at his best, check it out, best pool movie ever."
1.0,hustler,"Being the best isn't just about talent, it's about character.It's so true."
1.0,hustler,"Being the best isn't just about talent, it's about character"
1.0,hustler,"One of my all time favorites. Made from a short story that appeared in Playboy, this was the first place I ever saw ""the zone"" introduced. Athletes talk about being in the zone. Fast Eddie Felson demonstrated it and explained it. Great stuff!"
1.0,hustler,Sweaty and noir. Playing pool never looked so cool. Neither has Paul Newman for that matter...
1.0,hustler,"Newman, Gleason, Scott? Amazing."
1.0,hustler,"My favorite movie of all time. I great mix of Drama, Slick characters, and shooting some awesome pool. Fast and loose man."
1.0,hustler,"gritty raw newman fresh from actors studio, gleason rocks the pool hall, supported by george c scott and piper laurie this is a classic film for the ages"
1.0,hustler,"super cool paul newman shows the world how to play pool and get the girl. i like to think all of the shots are real, are they?"
1.0,hustler,"""Fast"" Eddie Felson, an example of the dichotomy of man: hard and masculine yet torn and vulnerable."
1.0,hustler,best sports film ever. paul newman is a legend.
1.0,hustler,"Look, kid, I don't rattle."
1.0,hustler,god they sure dont make em like they used to huh. paul newman may seriously be my favorite actor of all time. the guy just pours himself out in this movie. i wish movies today could do this.
1.0,hustler,"Strikes that magical balance between a phenomenal cast, a director with a gift for shadow and mood, and a near-perfect screenplay."
1.0,hustler,"I just watched it again this weekend, and my opinion of it actually went up. I love everything about it. The writing, acting, music, and cinematography are all top notch. Even if it weren't good, it would be worth seeing just for Newman's speech about the nature of greatness in human endeavor."
1.0,hustler,Part of this movie was shot in the Brown Hotel in downtown Louisville. The cast is phenomenal. I love this movie.
1.0,hustler,"Paul Newman is a badass in this movie, great cinematography, iconic script. A must see."
1.0,hustler,"'It's like I got oil in my arm. The pool cue's part of me. It's got nerves in it. You feel the roll of those balls. You don't have to look - you just know. You make shots that nobody's ever made, and you play that game the way nobody's ever played.'"
1.0,hustler,"Gripping, classy drama and very moving. Piper Laurie is fantastic."
1.0,hustler,Eran you must not be able to shoot a game of pool to save your life...An all time great
1.0,hustler,"Maravillosa: los personajes perfectos; Jackie Gleason, enorme... la atmÃ³sfera del local, muy conseguida. Una pelÃ­cula genial."
1.0,hustler,One of the best films ever created. It's pure manhood.
1.0,hustler,"A true classic of a movie. Such a cool feel to story, with great performances by George C. Scott as an all-time scum bag and Paul Newman who may very well be the coolest guy to ever walk the Earth."
1.0,hustler,fast edie felson! roxxx
1.0,hustler,The Great one in a great role.
1.0,hustler,"I'm not one to buy into the whole Black and White movies are best thing, but this film is just astonishing. It's the film Newman SHOULD have won the oscar for."
1.0,hustler,"The first pool match sequence is unforgettable. Captures the tension, the sweat and the endurance perfectly.And top performances all round."
1.0,hustler,This is the film which should've won Paul Newman the Oscar instead of its sequel - The Colour of Money. Fast Eddie is one of Newman's best roles - a man whose pool skills can't outrun his own inner demons and hangups. Jackie Gleason is great too - full of intensity as the great pool shark.
1.0,hustler,"One of the top 5 movies of all time. Piper Laurie, Paul Newman and George C. Scott in amazing roles."
1.0,hustler,"Seedy bars, rummies and hustling... this is the business."
1.0,hustler,I love this movie and get something out of it everytime I watch it. Paul Newman and Piper Laurie are just brilliant in this film. Such raw performances throughout that draw you in and bring you into the minds of all the characters involved.
1.0,hustler,I watch it once a year!
1.0,hustler,shows timeless struggle and is a classic in cinema
1.0,hustler,A great film for all men everwhere
1.0,hustler,Classic. Makes me want to take up pool. Drags a little in the middle.
1.0,hustler,"Paul Newman, Jackie Gleason, and George C Scott all at their best. If not for this film, there would be no Rounders."
1.0,hustler,"Paul Newman great, Jackie Gleason amazing, and George C. Scott awesome. All in all a neat story though I liked the book better but the pool skill shown is excellant too."
1.0,hustler,Witness the smile that launched a thousand salad dressings =)
1.0,hustler,Modern day Greek tragedy in a poolroom. Newman's best!!!
1.0,hustler,"My favourite sports film, and an incredible film on other levels too. The complex relationship between Eddie and Sarah is intensely intriguing. Newman's portrayal of Eddie is supreme, he plays the super cool character amazingly, it makes you want to be him!"

0.0,slumdog_millionaire,"It may have some noble intentions, but that can't make up for Slumdog Millionaire's unbelievably contrived/manipulative story, horribly shallow characters, and ridiculously unfocused direction. Slumdog Millionaire may very well be the most overrated film within the past 10 years."

1.0,three_colors_blue,"Brilliant, tragic, and rife with coincidence and fate."
1.0,three_colors_blue,"Possibly the most bleak and definitely my favorite of the trilogy, Blue explores how free one can truly be from one's past. It's really sad, but also quite hopeful in it's own way. The direction is flawless and Juliette Binoche is fantastic in the lead role. This is a gem of a film"
1.0,three_colors_blue,It all comes together!
1.0,three_colors_blue,Brilliant cinematography and a breathtakingly tragic plot are enough to mark this one under the masterpiece category.
1.0,three_colors_blue,"A wonderful, evanescent in its execution of grieving and escaping. A woman who wants the quiet life to exist but is faced with questions that arise from her dead husband. The need to exist and except can have its problems. Brilliantly directed and Juliette Binoche is just wonderful. A great film."
1.0,three_colors_blue,Es la mejor de las tres

1.0,three_colors_blue,"It felt like the perfect balance between motion picture, sound, music, colour and image. A movie so well treated by Kieslowski that every single thing meant something and nothing in the film was pointless or had no reason to be there."
1.0,three_colors_blue,It does not get much better than this.
1.0,three_colors_blue,Can't Say Nothing about it .... Just WOW !!

1.0,three_colors_blue,"My favorite of the ""Three Colours"" trilogy, ""Blue"" is a wonderful work of art, full of beauty and sadness. Its symbolism, its melancholy and its mistery are so overwhelming, that we are never truly able to reach them. Hard to describe, but marvellous to look at. Just beautiful."
1.0,three_colors_blue,Binoche gives an amazing performance in this great film.
1.0,three_colors_blue,"Kieslowski does a superb job with every facet of this film: the narrative, the content, the music, the style, etc. From the unique opening shot all the way to the end, it's a grief-ridden journey that leaves a mark. And Binoche has a commanding performance."

1.0,three_colors_blue,"A sumptuous, intelligent masterpiece."

1.0,three_colors_blue,Absolutely beautiful from beginning to end.
1.0,three_colors_blue,"Blue represents freedom. We demands freedom, but is not it arrogant to set free yourself? Like a music, you can't make it sing with only one note."
1.0,three_colors_blue,Bent and old person struggling to stuff empty glass bottles in a recylcing bin is a recurring scene linking the three stories.
1.0,three_colors_blue,C'est absolument splendide. Merveilleux
1.0,three_colors_blue,Blue and Red are my two faves of the trilogy with White pretty dispensible (might need a rewatching). If you see all three Red connects the films together. A very rewarding film.

1.0,three_colors_blue,Brilliant cinema - such a beautiful piece of film with truth honesty and superb acting
1.0,three_colors_blue,"why waste time or celluloid on trivia when the deepest things in life are as close as the air we breathe? a film about the beauty and pain of existence, about love and liberty, for better and for worse..."
1.0,three_colors_blue,"The depth of one s heart, one s mind, one s sorrow... a woman who cannot cry ,who keeps trying to suffocate her grief, who renounces everything after her loss but life finds a way to come back to her...she cries at the end, she is set free.... enticing on many levels"

1.0,three_colors_blue,"There are movies and Movies. This is a Movie. This is sort of opposite of ""Pan's labyrinth"" that suffocates the viewer with the underlying meaning that is forced down the viewers throat. This movie breaths. Kieslowski knows the means and is talking to us."
1.0,three_colors_blue,"Blue is a movie that engages the mind, challenges the senses, implores a resolution, and tells, with aesthetic grace and formal elegance, a good story and a political allegory."
1.0,three_colors_blue,Juliette Binoche delivers a tour de force performance in this first installment. Absolutely captivating and executed brilliantly.
1.0,three_colors_blue,"Deeply moving, beautifully photographed, delicately acted, a masterpiece. And yet it's not even the best film in the trilogy."

1.0,three_colors_blue,The best film of the trilogy. Binoche is superb.The use of music and colour to explore the psychological state of Binoche's character is outstanding.

1.0,three_colors_blue,Red and blue the first and the third films of Krzysztof Kieslowski are considered the greatest movies I've ever seen
1.0,three_colors_blue,Quiet but always mesmerizing.
1.0,three_colors_blue,I was not sure what I thought of this movie at first. It took me a few days to absorb it I guess. Now it is kind of always with me.
1.0,three_colors_blue,Such blissful unison of images and music makes Kieslowski worthy of god-like status in such divine endeavors. . .
1.0,three_colors_blue,One of the best films I've ever seen.
1.0,three_colors_blue,"la vi hace como 10 años, y la reveo con Jon; nos dimos maraton de la trilogia, 1 por dia."
1.0,three_colors_blue,The first in the Three Colors triology is perhaps the darkest. Kieslowski's tale of loss is truly powerful and the expert cinematography perfectly convey it's themes. I'm so glad Juliette Binoche chose this over Jurassic Park.
1.0,three_colors_blue,"A masterpiece, powerful and stunning"
1.0,three_colors_blue,"The first part of the Three Colours trilogy - Kieslowski last films. The Trilogy does not show up on here - so I'm including this to represent the other two as well: ""Three Colours: White"" and ""Three Colours: Red"". They really should be seen together."
1.0,three_colors_blue,she deserves two Grand-prix of the Cannes!
1.0,three_colors_blue,"Quizas una de las peliculas mas femeninas jamas realizada, acerca del abandono y el engano, con una Juliette Binoche entregando lo mejor de si en cada una de las escenas."
1.0,three_colors_blue,"A masterpiece of the cinematic arts. Kieslowski expertly tells this story a masterful control of narrative, light, color and sound. No less than the Rosetta Stone for understanding the rest of this great director's oeuvre."
1.0,three_colors_blue,"Sublime, sensual, potente... eso caracteriza a esta pelÃ­cula de Kieslowski y dichos adjetivos se aplican tambiÃ©n a la gran y preciosa Juliette Binoche en uno de sus roles mÃ¡s recordados. Simplemente una maravilla que cada vez que la vuelvo a ver me deja sin palabras. JOYA!"
1.0,three_colors_blue,Quite possibly one of the greatest films of the 1990s and one of the few movies which is just enrapturing each time you see it.
1.0,three_colors_blue,This film is amazing. I can't wait to watch Red & White
1.0,three_colors_blue,"My favorite of the ""Three Colors"" trilogy. It's an amazing examination of grief and loss and what a person is willing to do in order to start again."
1.0,three_colors_blue,"As an almost voyeuristic exploration of grief and loss, Blue is also a meditation into the way the creative impulse can pull a soul back from the brink of oblivion. Juliette Binoche's performance is haunting and tragic, and the whole look of the film is mesmerizing."
1.0,three_colors_blue,"Quieres sufrir, vean esto."
1.0,three_colors_blue,I knew I would like this. I love these kind of films where every little gesture and frame mean something and you actually lose something if you are not paying attention. I would like to see it on the big screen.
1.0,three_colors_blue,"No se por que en estos dias me he vuelto a sentir cercana, muy cercana a estas maravillosas peliculas...!"
1.0,three_colors_blue,"Dialog, photography, and psychology. Juliette Binoche is amazing."
1.0,three_colors_blue,"The best of Kieslowski's trilogy, and that's saying a lot. It's also one of the best roles ever for Binoche, who is terrific as a woman whose life is overshadowed by grief and loss. A treasure for fans of character studies and foreign films in general."
1.0,three_colors_blue,Possibly my favorite film of all time. Incredibly deep and moving and impossibly heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time. I have yet to watch a film that is more powerful or thought-provoking.
1.0,three_colors_blue,"Perfection at it's best, director, score, actress..."
1.0,three_colors_blue,Julie e Franta de la Revolutie incoace..
1.0,three_colors_blue,This is a beautiful film all around. I loved it!
1.0,three_colors_blue,Juliette Binoche is fantastic!!
1.0,three_colors_blue,"Reminded me of 'La Double vie de Veronique', though this movie was somehow more mature and subtle in its emotional themes. My favourite one out of the three colors."
1.0,three_colors_blue,One of the best movies about grieving and so beautiful!
1.0,three_colors_blue,What can I say? It's my favorite color.Juliette's absolutely fantastic. Great music and cinematography.

1.0,three_colors_blue,"Music, story and cinematography are superb."
1.0,three_colors_blue,"This is a great trilogy. ""White"" is close to me due to the fact that I'm from Russia, the mentality in the movie is the same, it's as if I was watching a story about my country. ""Blue"" is the toughest to watch (Binoche is amazing as always!)."
1.0,three_colors_blue,"Most movies are at best, good stories. Blue is art. Binoche is perfect in the role of the widow coping with the death of her husband and daughter. The cinematography, editing, and music are perfect. See this movie."
1.0,three_colors_blue,"Intrigante, compleja, matadora, interesante, discontinua, chillona y economica, bella..."
1.0,three_colors_blue,"The true masterpiece from Kieslowski .... last scenes of Juliette Binoche were simply breathtaking, in both the emotional and the beauty of it .... plus that score, OMG"
1.0,three_colors_blue,"I just rewatched this, and I cannot express enough how beautifully rich this film is, while also being very spare. Kieslowski was a master of using minimal words to weave intricate tapestries of emotion and humanity. Both political and intensely personal, this film is a masterpiece."
1.0,three_colors_blue,One of the best movies ever. Love the atmosphere. Love the music. Excellent.
1.0,three_colors_blue,I had almost forgotten movies could be this good.

1.0,three_colors_blue,"Amazing, masterful use of a prdemonantly visual medium for a multisensory experience. I felt like I had access to Julie's shock, grief, and hope through the ""blackouts"" and the submersions in the pool. There is a tactileness to the scenes. I can't wait for White and Red!"
1.0,three_colors_blue,I am at a loss for words right now. I could even see this rating increasing in the future right now. This movie is drenched in subtle nuance. I can't wait to see the next two Trois Couleurs
1.0,three_colors_blue,The last movies of Kieslowski.
1.0,three_colors_blue,"i'm speechless. i recommend that after seeing it, you should also watch it with the commentary of annette insdorf. and after seeing this you absolutly have to watch the White and the Red."
1.0,three_colors_blue,"First of the most astonishing cinematographic trilogy. Blue is for 'Liberte', the escape from loss told in visual fragments; an exploration of memory of a woman who loses her family in a car accident. Blue is about survival and the freedom of reinventing live."
1.0,three_colors_blue,Hermosa pelicula. Kieslowski at his best. My favorite film of the color trilogy.
1.0,three_colors_blue,one of the greatest director in film history making one of the deepest films ever and Juliette Binoche giving one of the greatest performances by an actress in film history.

1.0,three_colors_blue,"My favorite one of the trilogy. The music, combined with the brilliant photography and a stuning performance by Binoche, made this psychological drama one of my favorite films ever! Kieslowsky is a genious!"
1.0,three_colors_blue,Bleak but stunning film. Life is shattered and paused but eventually resumes.

1.0,three_colors_blue,"Visually compelling...*THE standard in art film* Driven solely on visuals, very little talking in this film. I can watch this repeatedly and still come up with new ideas."
1.0,three_colors_blue,What should I say? This is Kieslowski's best and Juliette Binoche ruled the world with the excellent performance.... One of the BESTEST...
1.0,three_colors_blue,Magnificent and marvellous. The sugar-lump close up says more in five seconds than most films manage in ninety minutes.
1.0,three_colors_blue,"Red, White, and Blue interconnect in a creative way--hardly a trilogy in the usual sense of the term. But the story of Binoche and her coming to grips with the loss of her conductor husband and daugher. The scenes of her swimming at night in the lit pool are haunting. Not sure why."
1.0,three_colors_blue,I loved these three movies. Watch this along with the other two (red and white).
1.0,three_colors_blue,"Excellent film making. The use of dramatic classical music and lighting here is remarkable.Juliette Binoche was exceptional in her role as well. Dark, mysterious and sexy, as it says on the cover. One fine film that was well worth watching."

1.0,three_colors_blue,"Beautiful and ultimately depressing. But I stuck through all of The Decalogue, so i assume that White and Red get lighter. Julliette Binoche gives her best performance. The marriage of cinematography and score is outstanding."
1.0,three_colors_blue,"I recommend all the trilogy, ""Blue"" is fantastic. Kieslowski was a great man...RIP"
1.0,three_colors_blue,Top 10 favorite. Have like this since my college days:) Very artistic angles and my favorite color is blue.
1.0,three_colors_blue,"I liked Juliette Binoche from other movies, but this one was shocking and somewhat sexy at the same time.. it just prooves she is a good actress."
1.0,three_colors_blue,"Kieslowki really knows how to use music to his advantage in this film. It feels like a vignette, in that White and Red are somehow connected to it. I liked this one the best, however. Juliette Binoche is amazing (as always)."
1.0,three_colors_blue,Excelente trilogia de Blue Blank y Rouge

1.0,three_colors_blue,"one of my favorite movies... really has to be seen with the two others of the color trilogy but even on it's own (they don't have to be seen together, but it helps) it's a wonderful movie about the pain of grieving, slow and subtle but it gets under your skin"
1.0,three_colors_blue,One of my top five favorite movies ever.
1.0,three_colors_blue,So beautiful depressing...

1.0,three_colors_blue,"The best of trois couleurs. A great one from Kieslowski. Binoche is impressive. The picture is rich, many symbols played in the movie and music is good and story is deep, how does people deal with the sense of lose and how does people resurrect out of self-exile. The power of liberty."
1.0,three_colors_blue,See my write-up on Red. -- Simply great filmmaking.
1.0,three_colors_blue,"My favorite one from the ""Trois couleurs"", though the other two are also wonderful movies.Juliette Binoche is also one of my favorite actresses. You cannot miss her performance in ""The English Patient"" (1996) and ""Chocolat"" (2000)."

1.0,three_colors_blue,Kieslowski es un poeta del cine. Unic i irrepetible
1.0,three_colors_blue,"Really important film for any buff. A visual treat for anybody, but expect the plot to be a bit more metaphorical than concrete."
1.0,three_colors_blue,An amazing film. My favorite Kieslowski.
1.0,three_colors_blue,"I'm not sure there's another filmmaker that can translate an idea, a concept into a cinematographic scene as Kieslowski does. He's also highly sensitive. Kieslowsky was a poet. Arguably, the most sensitive of all filmmakers."
1.0,three_colors_blue,This one is the second best.
1.0,three_colors_blue,"Una obra maestra. El dolor, el amor y la libertad abordados con una profundidad increíble. La musica es otro personaje en esta historia, igual de potente que el interpretado por Juliette Binoche."
1.0,three_colors_blue,"sad and beautiful film about love, loss and freedom. incredible work by Kieslowski, especially the ending is breathtaking. true masterful film-making."
1.0,three_colors_blue,"Vale la pena ver las tres peliculas de Trois Couleurs de una sentada. Pero si es cuestion de elegir una, elijo esta primero por la gran Juliette (aunque Julie e Irene son fantasticas, tambien) y por la representacion tan tenaz que Kieslowski hace de la libertad!"

1.0,three_colors_blue,"I didn't think much of it when I first saw it (what can I say, I was 17), but I've clearly come to love it. How optimistically you read the coda has a lot to do with whether: a) the choral finale is subtitiled (it's not in the DVD box set), and b) you've seen (and loved) Rouge."
1.0,three_colors_blue,"what it is with all these bleak movies...why do i like'em so much. never cared for white or red but this one; i absolutely love. j. binoche's outstanding acting with a haunting soundtrack, topped with beautiful cinematography built around my favorite color, and we have a winner."
1.0,three_colors_blue,Maybe the best film ever.

1.0,1075422-hamlet,"This epic, engrossing, completely uncut telling of William Shakespeare's masterpiece may be 4 hours long, but it's worth every second. From the gorgeous cinematography and art direction to the sublime performances; Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet is a cinematic feast."
1.0,1075422-hamlet,"The definitive Hamlet, four beautiful, exciting hours of towering literature brought to the screen in style."
1.0,1075422-hamlet,"""Hamlet"" de Kenneth Branagh es sin duda la adaptación más fiel a la obra teatral de Shakespeare. Plasmada de forma colosal y sin olvidar ninguno de sus diálogos o sus escenas y sobretodo por mostrar un excelente trabajo del director y los actores tan capaces de seguirlo en su ambiciosa adaptación."
1.0,1075422-hamlet,Easily my favorite Shakespeare adaptation so far
1.0,1075422-hamlet,holy shit this was good
1.0,1075422-hamlet,"The ultimate Shakespeare cinematic experience. It's four hours long, but not a second is wasted as Kenneth Branagh utilizes every line of the original 'Hamlet' script. Forget the Mel Gibson version, or even that overly-colorful Romeo + Juliet; this movie is where it's at."
1.0,1075422-hamlet,"I mean really, the only critique I could have about the movie would be the differing acting choices I would have made. But if that's really the worst thing you can say about a movie, it doesn't even count as a complaint.This movie would make the bard proud."
1.0,1075422-hamlet,Excessive but wonderfully filmed and (mostly) brilliantly acted. Richard Briers portrayal of Polonius is the finest I have ever seen.
1.0,1075422-hamlet,"The first unabridged adaptation of Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"" is yet the finest adaptation of the play that we have ever come to know. Don't be put off by the 4-hour length, since the film wastes none of it at all."
1.0,1075422-hamlet,"A Shakespeare adaptation doesn't get much better than this. Despite some awkward casting, Branagh's version of Hamlet does everything right. Great acting, awesome cinematography, and the film captures the sweeping emotion the play was originally going for."

1.0,1075422-hamlet,"One of the best play to screen movies of all time. Almost word for word to the book, Kenneth Branagh plays the young prince Hamlet of Denmark perfectly. Every actor does a stunning performance. A must watch. Worth four hours to watch you ask? Oh yes, totally worth it."
1.0,1075422-hamlet,So glad we watched the movie in class. It's a love letter to Shakespeare that's worth its 4 hours.
1.0,1075422-hamlet,"Although the play's setting is in one place (Blenheim Palace), Branagh proves in this movie how powerful he is as an actor."
1.0,1075422-hamlet,"The best interpretation of this play. Dynamic pacing, great production, and superb performance by Branagh."
1.0,1075422-hamlet,"Kenneth Branagh made ""Hamlet"" as it was meant to be experienced.

1.0,1075422-hamlet,"Hamlet is an intense, emotion packed film that, though over four hours long, is gripping from start to finish. With incredible performances from its entire cast and incredible cinematography, set design and costume design, Hamlet is by far one of the greatest movies ever made."
1.0,1075422-hamlet,One of the best films I've ever seen!The only nitpick I have is that Jack Lemmon's acting he seems like he doesn't care

1.0,1075422-hamlet,Kenneth Branagh's impressive version of Hamlet is arguably the best and most faithful ever committed to film. The all star cast is mind blowing and the visuals are stunning.

1.0,1075422-hamlet,"Olivier choose to butcher the Bard's tale, Branagh chooses to revel in all five acts and four hours of it. The result is a treat for Shakesbuffs, but others may be more comfortable with Lethal Hamlet."

1.0,1017346-red_shoes,One of the most Visually Unique movies ever made - kind of like a marriage between Brittish cinema and the o utlandishness of the Fellini influenced Italian Cinema.

1.0,sideways,"A great film. Humourous and emotional at the same time with an excellent performance from Thomas Haden Church, an actor who prior to this film, I thought was a washed up has been. I just didn't like being faced with a full frontal view of an overweight man's johnson towards the end."

1.0,sideways,"This film truly surprised me. I went in expecting a good film due to its reviews, but what I got was a uniquely rewarding experience that was everything from all-out raunchiness to good, clean fun. Worth the watch, most definitely."
1.0,sideways,"Great movie, great casting."

1.0,sideways,"I'm getting to this one 10 years later, but this is another reason why Alexander Payne is one of the best directors working today. This one is hard to recommend unless you're a fan of his previous work though."
1.0,sideways,"A very unique kind of comedy that this generation simply could never provide once more. If I'll be saying anything, it's easy for me to say that ""Sideways"" might just as well be my favourite comedy of the entire 2000's decade."
1.0,sideways,A great great movie. I love every second of it. So funny with such a great spirit. The pairing of Paul Giamatti and Thomas Haden Church is flawless. I'm not drinking any fucking Merlot!!!

1.0,sideways,"One of both mine and my Dad's favourite films to watch together. It's hilarious, truthful, touching and offensive all at once. Ever since watching this, I've been a fan Paul Giamatti.

1.0,sideways,"This film is so beautifully real, so intimate and human, filled with all the humour, misery and conflict that populates our lives. The acting is sublime - this film is made by those long, quiet moments and the tension and affection between the Church and Giamatti. Excellent film."

1.0,sideways,Sideways is far from your typical films. It's well-informed knowledge of Napa's Wine Community and usage of terminology to describe intamacy metaphorically proves that thier was plenty of thought put into making this film. Sandra Oh dazzles as always!
1.0,sideways,"Simultaneously funny and sad, Alexander Payne's story of two unhappy men at the crossroads in their lives is his best movie to date."
1.0,sideways,I just love these morons!

0.0,sideways,I couldn't even finish this movie
1.0,sideways,Giamatti and Haden Church have such a good chemistry together which is only matched by Virginia Madsen's performance. It's also incredibly funny.

1.0,sideways,"excellent,with very dry humour and a great cast of underrated actors,gimatti steals the filmI love this film it has such a quirky feel to it"
1.0,sideways,"A funny film that makes you care about two extremely flawed (and not just 'movie flawed' - see what Miles does at his mother's house) characters. Cracking dialogue, excellent acting, only as crude as it needs to be and touching.One of my favourite films."
1.0,sideways,"Really clever, beautiful, funny, well-written, sad, real, well-acted...I could go on. Love it."
1.0,sideways,An absolute masterpiece. There is not a single false note in the entire film.
1.0,sideways,Wonderful movie.It proves that you don't need a lot of bells and whistles when you have a good script and good actors.
1.0,sideways,"Baby Boomer coming of age sentiments with the sharpest dialogue, most shameless acting and over the top plot lines. Ridiculous and worth it."
1.0,sideways,Truly the best intelligent male buddy movie. Thomas Hayden Church and Paul Giamatti are superb. The scenery is amazing and it's the movie that got me into wine. It's so funny to see older men who are still stuck in their youth but in a fun way.
1.0,sideways,The complexity and yet simplicity of all the characters gives the audience something you don't see every day. An un-hollywooded version of real life. Add in some beautiful cinematography and you have a movie you can watch over and over again.
1.0,sideways,One word: Perfection
1.0,sideways,"Everything you love about the art of filmaking, summed up in two hours of perfection."

1.0,sideways,"A great great film with Giamatti's, and one of the decade's, best performance!"
0.0,sideways,I despised this movie
1.0,sideways,"The most heartfelt comedy in a generation. Paul Giamatti was plucked from relative obscurity to play the role of a lifetime in Alexander Payne's masterpiece, while Haden-Church, Madsen and Oh provide outstanding support. Missing out on Best Picture remains a genuine travesty."
1.0,sideways,an alexander payne masterpiece. very funny r rated comedy. paul giamatti with out a doubt was robbed of an oscar nod. the scene with him and virginia madsen and they are talking wine is so moving.

1.0,sideways,every wine enthusiast and recently divorced MUST watch this movie :) i watched on the plane coming back from Bordeaux and it really resonated with me.
1.0,sideways,"Sideways is a perfect film about love, friendship, commitment and more. Giamatti's performance as Miles is impressive. He's optimistic, depressed, pathetic, and yet so charming and likable."
1.0,sideways,"Pitch-perfect study of mid-life revisionism, last chances, and the reality of road-trips. Glorious, funny, dark-hearted, poignant. A career high for its two leads, Giamatti and Church, and some great performances from all in support, notably Oh."
1.0,sideways,"Sideways is one of those films that's a bit too good to review: It strikes a unique tone, blends a bit of tall-tale fun with everyday life, and pretty much hits every note in your psyche."
1.0,sideways,Love this film...so good.
0.0,sideways,this was a painful painful painful painful experience..the dvd should have came packaged with a book to read while this movie was playing.
1.0,sideways,"This is effing comedy of a different brand. Two best friends trying to figure out their lives in 2 different extreme perspectives. Its an intellectual piece of generic mid life drama and might not work for all viewers, but its definitely worth a try."
1.0,sideways,pura originalidad en el filme
1.0,sideways,"This is a movie that has a bit of everything, all of it great."
1.0,sideways,A laid back film that is perfected in the realm of drama and comedy. This movie should have won best picture in the Oscars by a millimeter.

1.0,sideways,Best comedy of it's kind since American Beauty. Perfect movie. My pick for Best Picture at the 2004 Oscars. Giamatti unjustly cheated out of a nomination.

1.0,sideways,"I was eager to see this movie and my expectations were rather high and this movie managed to live up to the hype. It goes to show that a movie is made by the story and characters, not by the money put into it."
1.0,sideways,Excelente Pelicula; quizas de lo mejor que he visto en los ultimos años del cine norteamericano!!!
0.0,sideways,Stopped watching too boring
1.0,sideways,"Deep. Thoughtful. Excellent cast, interesting plot, humorous script. A very accurate feeling portrayal of ""the midlife crisis""."
1.0,sideways,"This movie goes great with red wine. Be sure to have the bottle near by, because it's hard to walk away from this movie. It gets better with age."
0.0,sideways,"I found this movie completely inaccessible. It was painfully slow, elitist and contained two highly unappealing male lead characters (a real shame as I usually enjoy Paul Gambaccini's work). I'm sorry if this makes me philistine but it's over 2 hours of my life I'll never get back! Dreadful."
1.0,sideways,I watched this one late night and I loved it.
1.0,sideways,"I expect more wine in the love story ... actually I expect more love in this wine story ... by the way, just let me finish this glass and enjoy it again and again."

0.0,crouching_tiger_hidden_dragon,A girl who steals the manual of an ancient combat art fights better than the grand master of that art. Maybe they based Rey from SW on this girl. Trash.

1.0,before_sunset,Beautiful. Though there are moments that feel slightly manufactured I preferred this over the first. Does just about everything the first did perfectly but the shorter time span made the film tighter and really enforced the fact that these characters' time was limited.
0.0,before_sunset,Infinitely boring American romance with empty two-way dialogues.
0.0,before_sunset,Infinitely boring American romance with empty two-way dialogues.
1.0,before_sunset,Great performances and amazing dialogues.
1.0,before_sunset,"Richard Linklater's shortest feature film is probably one of his best. It's witty, romantic and insightful that tells a wonderful romantic story without following any cliches in any other romance films."
1.0,before_sunset,The movie is 81 minutes long and there isn't 5 seconds that aren't interested. The dialogue is perfect and the acting is divine. I wish Linklater would make a movie every few months.

1.0,before_sunset,Such a great movie! Linklater is awesome.
1.0,before_sunset,Such a lovely movie with an amazing cast. Hawke and Delpy really teach us what is into the world these days and before about this whole love situation. They just talk and talk for like an hour but you just doesn't feel it like that. It's amazing. What a history.
1.0,before_sunset,The connection between Jesse and Celine was so real and the dialog between the two was very light & refreshing. there are lots moments of conversation where I felt that could happen between any friends / couples. Easy to identify with. Really really enjoyed the film.

1.0,before_sunset,One of the best movies...ever
1.0,before_sunset,There is no better sequel and no better examination on what it means to lose that spark in life. Losing the romance you believed in and looking with sadness on the romance you settled it.

1.0,before_sunset,"These two fictional characters are among the most engaging in the history of romantic comedies. They are so ""real"" and yet so much more verbally articulated than the vast majority of people. One really feels for them and wishes a happy, long life together."
1.0,before_sunset,The dialogue touches the core of my heart so much.
1.0,before_sunset,"Though it's shorter and not quite as developed, Before Sunset continues what made the first film great, now with more depth and darkness to it's leads, making this one of the best sequels ever made and undoubtedly the best (until it's sequel) romantic sequel"
1.0,before_sunset,An engaging dialogue of coming to terms with a dream that you had 9 years ago and to know the reality through beautiful songs.
1.0,before_sunset,It's funny how I want all of the romantic cliche things happen to this perfect couple. The last 15 mins is soooo beautiful!
1.0,before_sunset,"My favorite of the ""Before"" series, this film is just about as romantic as modern cinema gets."

1.0,before_sunset,"I just see this movie seconds later after finishing ""Before Sunrise"" . I loved the first movie and I loved how ""Before Sunset"" started. The way Hawke and Delpy looked at each other after so much time and their expression of their feelings was so natural and adorable."
1.0,before_sunset,Best written screenplay ever. Hands down.
1.0,before_sunset,It was satisfying. Movie held true to it's predecessor.

1.0,before_sunset,"Its romantic leads, Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy, offer what might be their best and most heartbreaking performances of their careers along with fantastic directing from returning director, Richard Linklater."

1.0,before_sunset,"I really did like the long long conversations ... it makes the whole thing believable, It makes you pity yourself really, when was the last time you really engaged in such a long conversation ???"
1.0,before_sunset,Before Sunset gives new depth to the love story of Celine and Jesse. A richer and more fulfilling experience than the original. Filled with natural dialogue and the right balance of idealism and pragmatism. Must see!
1.0,before_sunset,Marginally better than the phenomenal first installment.
1.0,before_sunset,"hay muchas escenas inolvidables en esta pelÃ­cula, pero entre las mejores estÃ¡n la imitaciÃ³n de Nina Simone y cuando Celine toca una canciÃ³n escrita especialmente para Jesse. Puedo ver la primera y segunda parte, mil veces. Siempre hay algo nuevo."
1.0,before_sunset,Astonishing. Not just incredibly well-written and wonderfully engaging - you never feel like it's film because there is always that sense of reality to it.Amazing.
1.0,before_sunset,I still like this one as i like the first one; Before Sunrise. The script is still full of ideas and abstract concepts that are really interesting. The movie is made more interesting by using the time reference.
1.0,before_sunset,The best movie I ever seen.
1.0,before_sunset,"Sequel to my favorite romantic movie of all-time.Continues on their journey 9 years later, in real-time. What happened in between? Did they? Didn't they?"
1.0,before_sunset,it's like watching two smart people talking about anything and making the conversation very very interesting... this and the before sunrise are probably up there among the best talking films ever made...
1.0,before_sunset,Every frame and moment of this film is incredible. One of the greatest sequels of all time - possibly one of the strongest sequels that overshadow the original. I've watched this a million times - cant wait for 'before midnight' next year :)
1.0,before_sunset,"Not as charming as first one, but way more interesting in dialogue content-wise."
1.0,before_sunset,MUCH MUCH BETTER THAN BEFORE SUNRISE.
1.0,before_sunset,"A short movie about the hit and miss of two souls. Julie Deply is slowly but surely growing on me. Wonderful person, writer, woman. Highly recommended."
1.0,before_sunset,"Best romance ever. But SO much more than a romance. It's hard to tell someone what it's about. ""It's about two people that walk through the streets of Paris talking."" Classic, beautiful and poignant."
1.0,before_sunset,"The Perfect Sequel Ever Made ..Everything about this movie is so damn natural..all those brilliant long Takes, the Intellectual Discussions ..Amazing totally Amazing ;) !!"
1.0,before_sunset,wonderful and true romance movie
1.0,before_sunset,"Awww they meet again. Such good dialogue, will 'fate' bring them together again? Who knows maybe he should make another film; 'Not Quite Night or Day'."
1.0,before_sunset,"very simple ,, very unique.... A more mature sequel with a touch of melancholy, minus the color saturated romanticism of the earlier film - and the result is even more captivating. It even has a Truffaut-esque ending. Brilliant."
1.0,before_sunset,"9 years after they parted on their different paths from Vienna, Jesse and Celine meet again, much older and rational with a mature take on love and it's obligations and perils. Before sunset is a worthy successor to a gem of a movie with an ingenious ending, demanding a follow-up."
1.0,before_sunset,"The second movie of the series ( and a 3rd may be on the way) This is a great movie and done in real time (he has 90 minutes to catch a plane, and that's how much time the movie gives him) It's fantastic."
1.0,before_sunset,One of the best romantic movies I've seen so far!
1.0,before_sunset,"The movie that was the perfect sequel. I wish ""A Little Romance"" would have made a sequel like this. Always follow thru with your promises/plan and don't be afraid to tell a person what is important."
1.0,before_sunset,I love how in 1 1/2 hrs Linklater is able to capture a lot of the subtleties in romances. Like lying and then confessing your true feelings. Great sequel to Before Sunrise. Leaves a lot to the imagination in the end. And it was shot in an interesting way.
1.0,before_sunset,"is simple fantastic, full of hope love and romance, a more mature look of the story and fantastic Jesse i really really love it"
1.0,before_sunset,"Absolutely love this film! Probably in my top ten, i just never tire of seeing Celine and Jesse pick up where they left off in Vienna. I love the conversations they have especially that scene in the back of the van, the chemistry between them is palpable and utterly charming."
1.0,before_sunset,its interesting to see a sequel to a film where you think the characters ended happily together. this is ends like the first with a conclusion that will be debated but it could be answered in another nine years.
1.0,before_sunset,"Didn't think the sequel could or would be as good...WRONG...just as good...if you compared side by side without knowing or seeing the other, this is the better movie...being in Paris, most amazing city in the world IMO, does not hurt either...Julie Deply is a classic beauty..."
1.0,before_sunset,"Wonderful movie. Superb dialogue and chemistry. So many of the qualities of the first, but a little more grown up. Leaves you wanting to see another sequel of them another 10 years down the road."
1.0,before_sunset,"There are rare cases in which sequels supersede their predecessors, but seeing as that's impossible in this case, this sequel is miraculously its precursor's equal."
0.0,before_sunset,Soo incredably booring... sorry... but I stoped watching halfway through.

1.0,before_sunset,an amazing film on a millioni levels
1.0,before_sunset,My favorite romantic movie of all time.
0.0,before_sunset,"One of the most unutterably tedious films I have ever sat through. If you have ever been in a room while two nauseatingly self-obsessed people fall in love with each other by making sparkling conversation that completely excludes you, then you have lived this film.There are some nice views of Paris."

1.0,before_sunset,"So natural, so true, so beautiful..."
1.0,before_sunset,"One sequel that I can honestly say was as good as the first. The locations again are perfect and script is superb. I LOVE the fact they used the same actors, shot the films 9 years apart, and they played perfectly that way in the film. Not many directors/actors/writers can do this that well."
1.0,before_sunset,Almost better than the original.
1.0,before_sunset,"Sekuel from before sunrise, really love it"
1.0,before_sunset,One of the best dialogue-driven dramas I've ever seen.

1.0,before_sunset,Just as fantastic as the first one.
1.0,before_sunset,Suosittelen ihan kaikille :)
1.0,before_sunset,"More great conversation, this time walking around Paris. Hope they turn this into a trilogy..."
1.0,before_sunset,"Both characters have seemingly turned anorexic since their first tryst. Ethan Hawke, in particular, looks like a shrunken head on a stick one might find in some forgotten corner of the Amazon."
1.0,before_sunset,Continued with this romantic story centered in the find of true love .
1.0,before_sunset,Easily one of the greatest movies of all time.
1.0,before_sunset,"A beatifully-shot, superbly-acted masterpiece of script and improvisation."
1.0,before_sunset,"A couple steps above Before Sunset because the dialogue is a little more to my liking. If you look at these two films as one, which I do, then I believe it is undoubtedly the best romance movie of all time"
1.0,before_sunset,"I didn't like it so much the first time, but now I think it's at least as good as Before Sunrise."

1.0,before_sunset,The best romance I've seen
1.0,before_sunset,"This is, in my opinion, one of the greatest films ever made. It is the purest of dialogue centric films, and thus an amazing example of what can be done when cinema is broken down to it's simplest form."
1.0,before_sunset,Great great movie. Fantastic conversations between the two roles.
1.0,before_sunset,So sadly romantic.....loved seeing it again..
1.0,before_sunset,"Richard Linklater repeat his phenomenal style in this great sequel. I think, Kim ki Duk little bit copying this to melodramatic mainstream approaching at his film. Truly electrifying piece of cinema!!!"

1.0,before_sunset,"Amazing sequel. Where the first was about the joy of watching two people fall in love this is a more difficult watch, especially if you've had your own midlife realisation that life could be different. Amazing acting. Heart wrenching. Watch it."

1.0,before_sunset,"A flawless follow-up to one of the finest romances ever made. It's matured with its characters, and the script is twice as insightful. Not as dreamily romantic, but more grounded in reality than the first. The ending is one of the best I've ever seen."
1.0,before_sunset,"have never seen such a simple yet flawless and appealing movie.. the thign worth notice was the ONE NIGHT both spend with each other 9 years ago which has clung to their memories like a leech, that it unsettled them with al the subsequent relations..wish i met someone like Julie delpy.."

1.0,graduate,"The Graduate, in my opinion is the movie that has everything that anyone would want, humor, heart, a dash of suspense, and also serves as a perfect social commentary on 1960s culture.

1.0,graduate,"Cliche to say it, but must be said: One of the most important films of the modern era.

1.0,graduate,One of my top three favorite movies. Strange at first but excellent and creative.
1.0,graduate,"An american classic with SO much to say in its short time frame its almost too much to handle. It's a social satire, a dark comedy, and an acting powerhouse with an ending that is one of the most wrongly interpreted in history. I watched it in film class and immediately understood why."

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"A thrilling and lively version of the Robin Hood tale, and possibly the quintessential Errol Flynn film. The sets and melodramatic script are so hokey as to be charming. Rathbone is absolutely over the top. Huge fun to watch."

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,Fantastic. Swashbuckling at its best.
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,Was anyone ever younger and more full of life than Errol Flynn onscreen? Doesn't Olivia de Havilland's Maid Marian melt your heart? Doesn't Claude Rains define malevolence? And the musical score deserves equal billing with the lead actors!

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,My favorite Robin Hood by far!
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,Errol Flynn was the best Robin Hood ever! No amount of remakes or re-imaginings can change that. The word swashbuckler was invented for this movie. They just don't make them like this anymore.

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"Despite being tacky by 21st century standards, it is a great movie to watch in my opinion. I just love Olivia de Havilland.

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,The ultimate Korngold score -- written before they shot a frame. Arguably the ultimate Flynn too. Claude Rains and Basil Rathbone shine. Alan Hale is hearty.

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,I love Robin Hood. He is just wonderful!
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,Great movie. Anyone who doesn't think Flynn was a good actor should watch this movie. It takes a good actor to say some of these corny lines and have the character still be a believable swashbuckler. Great job.

1.0,gone_with_the_wind,This film shows us a fantastic perspective of an inner struggle within Scarlett O'hara where we get to witness a story of happiness and dispair for a woman who wants nothing but happiness and in return recieves a lifelong lesson where there is truly no place like home!
0.0,gone_with_the_wind,2/10A movie so bad it probably started WWII
1.0,gone_with_the_wind,Long and a little drawn out in places but the cast and acting make up for it.
0.0,gone_with_the_wind,"Too long. Too sappy. TOO HEARTBREAKING! This was a HUGE disappointment. I bought this movie, hoping that I would be watching something DECENT! All in all, I don't recommend it at all. The only good part is Clark Gable"

1.0,gone_with_the_wind,The greatest love story of all time because it is almost reality instead of your average fairy tales. Such is life. Too much wisdom from Rhett Butler' s lines as well. You can never get enough of the precious 222 minutes. One still yearns to demand more!! Inspiring. Hurtful. Daring.
1.0,gone_with_the_wind,BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!:)
1.0,gone_with_the_wind,An absolute classic of the old world with an impossibly good performance from Vivien Leigh. Full review later.
1.0,gone_with_the_wind,A true classic in every way. Probably two of the most tragic characters ever portrayed. They do everything to make the audience dislike them but their circumstances and the depth and complexity given to them by Gable and Leigh make them two of the most memorable characters in film history.
1.0,gone_with_the_wind,Absolutely epic in scale while staying totally human. Gone with the End is truly a great picture
1.0,gone_with_the_wind,wonderful movie ð???

1.0,annie_hall,"There's a reason why this is everyone's favorite Woody Allen movie. Here he transcends above his purely comedic niche; the humor in Annie Hall, although never missing a beat, is merely a backdrop for the meaningful exploration of love and human relationships."

1.0,annie_hall,Re-watched recently after watching for the first time 7-8 years ago and I was just BLOWN AWAY at how funny and heartwarming this film is. One of the best!
1.0,annie_hall,A groundbreaking comedy. Achieves a difficult balance of silliness and pretension.
1.0,annie_hall,"Really great, swift, fast-paced, entertaining, brilliantly acted. Woody Allen's neurotic ramblings don't get in the way of a great, honest story."
1.0,annie_hall,Seminal film. Adored and watched over and over from childhood to now.
1.0,annie_hall,"Well deserving of its oscar win, Annie Hall combines all the elements of a good comedy with great performances and terrific script by Woody Allen. It can be arguably the best Woody Allen film."

1.0,annie_hall,A fresh movie.Great story.A MUST SEE.
1.0,annie_hall,One of the greatest movies I've ever seen.
1.0,annie_hall,THAT MOVIE MADE ME SAD AT THE END
1.0,annie_hall,"Alvy Singer's self constructed quandaries of himself, his lovers, fellow New Yorkers and the world are intimately shared with the audience and random passerby's on the street...it's the crème de la crème of cerebral comedies and Woody Allen is a dialogue virtuoso and the king of anxiety."
1.0,annie_hall,An American classic.
1.0,annie_hall,So much fun to watch.
1.0,annie_hall,"Truly the funniest and most poignant film above love and relationships, and the crazy lapse of a heartbroken mind trying to put the pieces back together. Every romantic comedy worth a damn, including ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""500 Days of Summer"" would not be around if not for this."
1.0,annie_hall,Another Woody Allen great
1.0,annie_hall,"Superb comedy from Allen, amazingly dry comedy and superb observational comedy."

1.0,annie_hall,laugh out loud everytime I watch it!

1.0,annie_hall,"Funny, bittersweet, and well constructed."
1.0,annie_hall,Wonderfully inspiring.
1.0,annie_hall,"Charming, witty, and heartfelt. I found myself laughing quite a bit at the antics of neurotic Alvy and the dopiness of Annie. I now understand why this is considered the greatest romantic comedy, because these are actual CHARACTERS!"
1.0,annie_hall,One of my favorite films of all time. <3
1.0,annie_hall,"Woody Allen isn't traditionally funny, but he was hilarious in this amazing romantic comedy. In addition, Diane Keaton played Annie Hall very well and the story itself was wonderful and much better than the majority of romantic comedy plots."
1.0,annie_hall,For the neurotic in all of us. This is the romantic comedy of all time.
1.0,annie_hall,"El clÃ¡sico de Woody Allen, con muy excelentes gags. Humor del bueno ;)"

1.0,annie_hall,"Stylistic and touching, Annie Hall is a witty and classic film filled with great performances and amazing direction and writing by Woody Allen."
1.0,annie_hall,"It's just genius the way it plays with movie elements in a very unusual way, like breaking the 4th wall, subverting the use of subtitles, dialoguing with strangers out of the blue... That's just too funny. =P"
1.0,annie_hall,"Of course, Annie Hall is Woody Allen's satire masterpiece. Allen and Keaton have great chemistry that results in a marvelous, contending and sweet picture."
1.0,annie_hall,Must See! A nervous romance.
1.0,annie_hall,"In 1977, this film beat Star Wars for Best Picture..........and it deserved it"
1.0,annie_hall,"Woody Allen isn't just a great film maker, but I great actor and comic. Loved the screenplay, cinematography, Diane Keaton was great as Annie Hall, definitley worthy of Best Picture that year."

1.0,annie_hall,A great comedy from a comedy genius. Great performances and a great screenplay.
1.0,annie_hall,"A thoroughly enjoyable film which could easily be classified as ""romantic comedy"" even though the very sound of that seems to cheapen the groundbreaking, heartfelt quality it exudes. Timeless and beautiful and nearly faultless."
1.0,annie_hall,"Allen's best ever. It's charming drama and probably the smartest of Allen works. With social issue and memorable funny romantic script, just simply the best. Pure entertainment of this century!!"
1.0,annie_hall,The quintessential Woody Allen masterpiece.

1.0,annie_hall,"A funny, unconventional, post-modern masterpiece."
1.0,annie_hall,Woody Allen has a world of his own when it comes to narrative work and dialogue. Wonderful film!
1.0,annie_hall,Anybody saying that Allen's movies are getting better compared to the earlier stuff are clearly mistaken.
1.0,annie_hall,The best romantic comedy ever made.
1.0,annie_hall,"It manages to be hilarious, deeply touching and devastating all mostly at the same time, and it seems to do it with very little effort. Easily one of the most brilliant romantic comedies ever made."
1.0,annie_hall,Just may be my favorite movie ever
1.0,annie_hall,"When you are looking for a laugh, you just can't get any better than Woody Allen. Witty and charming."
1.0,annie_hall,This is the highest echelon among romantic pictures for mature on a movie history.

1.0,annie_hall,"Woody Allen's best, in what might be the beginning of serious Woody. So much truth about relationships, and still very funny."
1.0,annie_hall,"Woody Allen at his most neurotic, witty and wry."
1.0,annie_hall,The movie that made me fall in love with movies.
1.0,annie_hall,A New definition for Comedy!
1.0,annie_hall,"one of the best movies ever, maybe"
1.0,annie_hall,"""We use a large vibrating egg"""
1.0,annie_hall,Perfect movie for today.
1.0,annie_hall,Loved it. Perhaps a film to appreciate at a certain point in your life. I can imagine not empathising with it's themes as much when I was younger.
1.0,annie_hall,BRILLIANTLY WRITTEN!
1.0,annie_hall,Woody Allen's best. The greatest romance of all time.
1.0,annie_hall,Because I need the eggs.
1.0,annie_hall,"Oh what the hell, I never left a review? Saw a few clips tonight on an old Siskel & Ebert show about Woody Allen and Mel Brooks, was reminded this is truly one of the best movies I've ever seen. Absolutely brilliant."
1.0,annie_hall,"Alvy Singer: ""You know, I - I feel that life is - is divided up into the horrible and the miserable. Those are the two categories, you know."" My kind of guy! Absolutely brilliant comedy by Woody Allen, with the wittiest dialogue of any film in history."
1.0,annie_hall,I love everything about this film. I'm a big Woody Allen fan. I identify well with his sense of humor. So clearly I'd be in love with his masterpiece.
1.0,annie_hall,Again. Watch it and love it.
1.0,annie_hall,The way Woody Allen potrays this love story is genius. He gives a strong comedic performance and some clever scences (Especially the one where Annie and Alvy have a conversation while their thoughts are subtitled) which make this a timeless classic.
1.0,annie_hall,Loved it! Woody at his best.
1.0,annie_hall,Woody Allen's Masterpiece
1.0,annie_hall,"Very well made film; Definatly Allen's greatest work with much witty comedy and a great pllot that is easy, and fun, to follow. Not a movie you leave feeling disappointed by the build up."
1.0,annie_hall,This movie completely sucked. Woody Allen strikes out again with this crapshoot. He should stick to just acting or directing; he tries to do it all and can barely do either. I would have rather played with a large vibrating egg myself than watch this.
1.0,annie_hall,"The most perfect movie to ever exist. A beyond honest love story and exploration and exploitation of the human condition in love. Beautifully sharp, charming, and performed flawlessly by all players."
1.0,annie_hall,i can see why this beat out star wars for best picture...
1.0,annie_hall,"Sets the bar impossibly high for how good a rom-com should be, and what it ever could be. Such unique, brilliant, and delightful storytelling. I can see why it won Best Picture in '77 over Star Wars, still can't say I agree with the decision although :P"
1.0,annie_hall,Woody Allen movie that originally Annie was a secondary character. With rewrites Annie became more central to the story. Diana Keaton & Woody Allan perfect couple.
1.0,annie_hall,Woody Allen`s first great film!
1.0,annie_hall,"This isn't just the best film from 1977. This is one of the best films on relationships ever made. If it weren't for ""Annie Hall"", there would be no Seinfeld, arguably. Woody Allen's best work, and that's saying a lot."
1.0,annie_hall,"""Don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love."""
1.0,annie_hall,"This is what romantic comedies USED to be, and what they were at their best: Funny, Sweet, and Romantic."
1.0,annie_hall,a very interesting movie.
0.0,annie_hall,I have no clue how this movie beat out Star Wars for an Oscar. It was so D-U-L-L!
1.0,annie_hall,I have watched this movie over and over its such a great film.
1.0,annie_hall,"Theaters were packed--the movie is a laugh riot--and everybody was falling in love with Diane Keaton. She was completely disarming and funny and unforgettable. (Later, she was on the cover of Rolling Stone magazine and the caption read: ""The next Hepburn."") Very recommended!"
1.0,annie_hall,it's Woody 101. seems fairly simple compared to his later films... but it's impossible to deny its appeal. nothing explains him better than this.
1.0,annie_hall,Best Romantic Comedy ever.
1.0,annie_hall,Movies like this remind you why Woody Allen is the genius he is. It's a shame he hasn't kept it up for some time now.
1.0,annie_hall,My favorite film ever!
1.0,annie_hall,"Either the saddest funny movie ever, or the funniest sad movie ever. Either way, Five Stars."
1.0,annie_hall,allen's finest and maybe best comedic drama of any film
1.0,annie_hall,"Melhor filme do Allen, melhor comédia romântica ever, e um dos melhores filmes da história do cinema."
1.0,annie_hall,What can I say about this? The perennial modern relationship movie.
1.0,annie_hall,Nunca entraría a un club en el que estuviera alguien como yo.
1.0,annie_hall,"Personal as the story he is telling may be, what separates this film from Allen's own past work and most other recent comedy is its general believability."
1.0,annie_hall,"Hey, don't knock masturbation. It's sex with someone I love."
0.0,annie_hall,I'm Not a fan of Woody's films. WAY over rated!!
1.0,annie_hall,Annie Hall is quite funny and interesting. I enjoyed it all the way trough.
1.0,annie_hall,I can't understand why I didn't see this amazing movie before!! My Woody's favorite!!
1.0,annie_hall,"One of the best movies ever created, period."
1.0,annie_hall,Not sure how to put it into words... Funny and exactly how love and life is.....
1.0,annie_hall,"As a kid I first appreciated Star Wars before I appreciated Woody Allen, thus, upon first seeing Annie Hall snagging the Oscar over A New Hope I was devastated. However, now, I'm not so upset."
1.0,annie_hall,"The turning point of Woody Allen's career, this is still arguably the greatest romantic comedy ever made. Every romantic comedy should aspire to this!"
1.0,annie_hall,"Before I'd finally watched it, I flatly (snobbishly) regarded Annie Hall as ""that dumb comedy that robbed Star Wars of Best Picture."" And while part of me is still butt-hurt about it, I can honestly say it's an equally impressive film...."
1.0,annie_hall,"Twenty minutes into this movie, I fell in love with it. It has some of the smartest writing I've ever seen, but when I thought that it couldn't get possibly any better, Christopher Walken and Jeff Goldblum showed up. I was completely blown away!"
1.0,annie_hall,So many things put together in such a short movie.The best romantic and realistic love movie of all time.
1.0,annie_hall,"""-Creo que se le da tanta importancia al orgasmo para compensar las zonas vacías de la vida...-Quien dijo eso?-el marques de Sade.""Siempre hay dialogos y frases que te han reir a carcajadas con ese ingenio tan caracteristico de el pero sin duda es una de las mejores peliculas de Allen."
1.0,annie_hall,One of the best films ever made. Allen has never been able to top it.
1.0,annie_hall,"Written with brilliant wit and sense of humour, Annie Hall is a revolutionary film that screams ""GENIOUS"" in every frame. Woody Allen and Diane Keaton are perfectly hilarious as the main couple."
1.0,annie_hall,Woody Allen only goes down from here.
1.0,annie_hall,"A brilliant, funny and perfect movie."
1.0,annie_hall,Definitely my favorite Woody Allen's movie.
0.0,annie_hall,I hate this movie. I hate Diane Keaton. I have no reasons. Just hatred.
1.0,annie_hall,Set the template for the modern Romantic Comedy. A Comedic Masterpiece that showcased what a master Auteur Woody Allen is.
1.0,annie_hall,"A look at relationships that is both witty and honest,"
1.0,annie_hall,To my facebook friends who are on the fence: It's an amazing movie. Watch it now.
1.0,annie_hall,"The only romantic comedy I actually like so far, it's probably because it's actually funny without all the cliches. Seems like Woody Allen just thought up a lot of different funny scenarios and then wrote this movie, you think it would be a mess but it turned out great."
1.0,annie_hall,I have seen this numerous times since it came out. I believe I saw it in the theater in Cape May. I go through my Woody Allen periods. This is superbly acted. I think I appreciate this movie even more as an adult than when I was younger as I stumble through trying to come to terms with who I am.
1.0,annie_hall,I think it's victory over Star Wars was entirely deserved. A masterpiece.
1.0,annie_hall,"Just about every movie or television show that I like reminds me of either ""Annie Hall"" or my favorite movie of all times ""Manhattan."""
1.0,annie_hall,"""É uma antiga piada: duas velhinhas em um hotel fazenda. Uma diz: 'A comida aqui é um horror'. A outra diz: 'Eu sei, porções minúsculas'. É assim que eu vejo a vida: cheia de solidão, miséria, sofrimento e tristeza, e acaba rápido demais""."
1.0,annie_hall,"Es una comedia romÃ¡ntica con un toque que jamÃ¡s habÃ­a visto. De hecho de seguro fue un referente para 500 of sumer (Â¿500 dÃ­as con ella? o Â¿500 de verano?). Abarca crÃ­ticas sociales acerca de las relaciones de pareja de una forma sin igual. Muy buena, tienen que verla."
1.0,annie_hall,"This is amazing. As entertaining and intelligent as you wish a film would be, Annie Hall is probably Woody Allen's most successfully executed film. It's every bit as good as people keep telling you. Watch it and fall in love with what is most certainly an essential film. Enjoy!"
1.0,annie_hall,"La de da, la de da, la la .. :)"
1.0,the_lunchbox,I am falling in love with Indian film. The Lunch Box talks of aging and infidelity with a subtle commentary of the fragile position women have in Indian society. A must see.

1.0,the_lunchbox,"A really fantastic film straight out of India. The Lunchbox is thoughtful, relatable, and very human. if you're looking for a low key film with a rich identity, it's a lovely watch for a sunday afternoon. Be warned, it will make you really, really hungry."
1.0,the_lunchbox,terrific little film. A gem in my view
1.0,the_lunchbox,Slice of life. My kinda movie
1.0,the_lunchbox,Beautiful movie. I never knew about this lunch delivery service stuff. What an original concept and idea for a film. I found the ending very frustrating though. This is one where I would have like some resolution at the end. Blame Disney I guess! Loved it though.
1.0,the_lunchbox,The only negative thing about it this movie is that it made me really hungry. ð???
1.0,the_lunchbox,Speechless!! Worth appreciation. Highly recommended for national and international audiences! This movie could not have been made in Hollywood! Perfect location for such a tasty LUNCH!!
1.0,the_lunchbox,And endearing love story.
1.0,the_lunchbox,"Delightful, charming, film - complex characters, ending leaves you guessing and conversing."
1.0,the_lunchbox,Great movies... Far better from all those silly indian movies i see in my every day life... I really Wish the ending would have been a little longer with Ila and Fernandes atleast looking at each other... if not meeting.
1.0,the_lunchbox,Subtle metaphors abound in this philosophical tale about interwoven lives trying to attain happiness & nirvana in a very inequitable aspect of Indian culture.
1.0,the_lunchbox,Recommended to Maria Piromalli
1.0,the_lunchbox,Beautiful film from Ritesh Batra with some very heartfelt performances.
1.0,the_lunchbox,"One of the best films I've seen in a long time. Irrfan Khan was superb, as always, Nawazuddin Siddiqui lit up the screen, as he does, and Nimrat Kaur was gorgeous and sweet. Beautifully written, simply produced, subtle and true. It really made me miss India and made me really hungry, too."

1.0,the_lunchbox,?? ???? ??? ????? ?????
1.0,the_lunchbox,"This is a top 5 ""romantic"" movie of all time for me. The writing, the cinematography, the bang on authenticity are all flawless. But they all take a back seat (and rightly so) to the fantastic performances from the three central cast. Khan and Kaur deserved Oscar nods..."
0.0,the_lunchbox,"awkward dialogue, very slow story line, and in the end, nothing happens."
1.0,the_lunchbox,Classic! It was perfect!

1.0,the_lunchbox,Just experiencing the chaos of India and the unique relationship between two lonely people makes this worth seeing.
1.0,the_lunchbox,This is already one of my favorite small films of the year. No explosions. No super-heroes and no Godzilla. But instead a wonderful story about the complex issues of human connections. Wonderful
1.0,the_lunchbox,"I love going into movies not knowing what I'm about to see, so this was a real treat. For those who don't mind a bit more information, this takes place in Mumbai & has cooking & eating in it, as well as dabbawallahs (the guys who deliver lunches), motor scooters & lots of heart. Go. Enjoy."

1.0,the_lunchbox,Lovely film about two strangers who become friends through letters written left in a lunchbox. A great reflection about how alone one can fill in a city full of people and how one person's friendship can change everything.
1.0,the_lunchbox,Absolutely phenomenal
1.0,the_lunchbox,Who would have thought a love story could be told in a completely novel way. This is not your typical Bollywood. Delicious.
1.0,the_lunchbox,"As an Indian, this is probably one of the best films that has come out of Bollywood this year. For once its not a westernized rom-com with no plot or character development, and it rings true in so many ways."
1.0,the_lunchbox,The lunchbox delivery and return was fascinating. The warm relationship that developed through the lunchbox correspondence was also fascinating. It was a unique film and I highly recommend it.

1.0,the_lunchbox,I loved this gentle story.
1.0,the_lunchbox,"The best Indian film to come out of 2013, 'The Lunchbox' shows us a love story that is so peculiar, but a story that is necessary. To call this a rom-com would undermine the big picture. The Lunchbox is one of the best Indian films of all time."

1.0,city_lights,"Despite some gaps in logic such as the cure, and the eccentric millionaire parts, this film contains the most tender romance in the history of film, and thus, rightly deserves its masterpiece status. It is Chaplin's crowning glory, and possibly the greatest ending in the history of film."
1.0,city_lights,"(SPOILER ALERT) This film gave me another definition of comedy: ""A misunderstanding blown way out of proportion"" -- this is evident when our beloved Tramp is mistaken for a burglar, even though his millionaire friend gave him one grand to give to his leading lady."
1.0,city_lights,"Falling in love with a blind flower girl and befriending a suicidal millionaire are just a few of the Tramp's antics in this fun Chaplin classic. Although the plot and resolution can seem a little far-fetched and ridiculous, I would argue this to be Charlie Chaplin's finest work."

1.0,city_lights,"Another Chaplin masterpiece. What 'Modern Times' stands out of its humor, this one stand out in its charm. It is oh so beautiful, when the ending more classic then the movie itself. Chaplin's themes are totally universal, this will be loved for centuries to come."

1.0,city_lights,"this is the best silent film ever made, near-flawless."
1.0,city_lights,"The epitome of Humanist Cinema. Anyone who can get through the final frames of this Film with dry eyes should undergo a drastic reevaluation of his/her life. For if it be so, something has been torn from his/her soul somewhere along the way --- possibly never to be regained."
1.0,city_lights,"If ever a comedian pushed the limits of a genre that gets little to no critical recognition, it was Chaplin. This film sums up all of the greatest possibilites you can acheive when you dangerously mix comedy and sentiment. He pulls it off beautifully in this film."
1.0,city_lights,"A combination of classic filmmaking technique, comic invention, and human beauty. More sweet and uplifting than most anything I've ever seen. Truly a beautiful film. And it's freaking hilarious."

1.0,city_lights,the best of the Chaplin films.
1.0,city_lights,I'm revisiting all the Chaplin films for the first time since watching them with my grandma as a kid. This is a magical revelation. It's amazing how much emotion you can produce without a single word.
1.0,city_lights,The last scene slew me...
1.0,city_lights,Timeless Romantic Comedy
1.0,city_lights,"One of the best movies ever. Totally groundbreaking at that time. Chaplin is capable to blend different sublime sketches into one harmonious storyline. Every scene,every part fluidly rolls into the other, the acting is perfect and hilarious."
1.0,city_lights,Charlie Chaplin can express more with a look than most can with a torrent of words. Subtlety at its finest.
1.0,city_lights,"see it, we are watching a legend here"
1.0,city_lights,Chaplin's masterpiece. City Lights remains 77 years later one of the most moving films I've ever seen and one of the great movie love stories. Chaplin remains one of the funniest actors in cinema and his films remain some of the most perfect and sentimental.
1.0,city_lights,I loved it!! It was so great. Chaplin never fails to get a laugh.
1.0,city_lights,OBRA MAESTRAAAAAAAAAAAAA
1.0,city_lights,"Absolutely brilliant. Heart wrenching, hilarious, such a prime example of what film can really be, so early in the medium's youth."
1.0,city_lights,"One of the best movies. Sweet, romantic, funny, silly, kooky. . .just superb"
1.0,city_lights,Fully lived up to its reputation.
1.0,city_lights,One of the most wonderful films I've ever seen.
1.0,city_lights,Chaplin's first masterpience
1.0,city_lights,"Best Movie ever made...the comedy is funnier; the romance is more genuine; the pathos is pathos-ier... if you get a chance, see it with an audience."
1.0,city_lights,"City Lights is the #1 Romantic Comedy according to AFI and I agree hands down. If you enjoy the genre this masterpiece is a must see. It will make you laugh, cry and it will linger in your thoughts long after watching it. How many movies can do that?? Not many."
1.0,city_lights,I don't know if a movie can ever get any better than this.
1.0,city_lights,so sweet and funny. it's so fun watching this movie over again and noticing all of the things that have been referenced in so many other films and tv shows.
1.0,city_lights,He he. Morsom film som må sees. Ikke bli skremt av at det er en stumfilm.
1.0,city_lights,Charles Chaplin is a movie-making genius. I dare you not to laugh!
1.0,city_lights,Deffinently one of Chaplin's Greatest films.
1.0,city_lights,I think this is Chaplin's best film. Chaplin is at his best and the emotional roller coaster ride you go on in this movie leaves you exhausted by the end (in a good way). You can't help but feel for The Tramp as he does everything he can to help this blind flower girl.
1.0,city_lights,"A la fin, quand la jolie fleuriste dÃ©couvre l'identitÃ© de son bienfaiteur, impossible de ne pas fondre en larmes."
1.0,city_lights,"Beautiful set pieces. The blind girl. The Tramp. And the flowers. A great romantic delight from start to end. The prizefight part is one of the early comedies greatest achievement. And the final scene is just hearbreaking, despite the fact that the couple find each other in the end."
1.0,city_lights,The best Charlie Chaplin film!
1.0,city_lights,My favorite Chaplin performance and one of his best ever. Both poignant and prodigious in the era of Silent Films. An ardent display of great pantomime comedy and solemn romance that has an ending that will make you reach for a tissue.
1.0,city_lights,"The ending of this movie says it all. If you can watch it and not shed a tear you are in need of a doctor to check for a pulse. This movie is moving, funny, and a true classic."
1.0,city_lights,"This film just makes me feel overwhelmingly happy! A rare occurance, and probably the only romance I will ever like."
1.0,city_lights,Wow. This is something special.
1.0,city_lights,Easily one of the best movies ever made. =]
1.0,city_lights,Great movie. For a silent film it manages to have humor and romance blended in well together. The final scene is impeccable.
1.0,city_lights,Definitely one of the best endings to any film I've seen.
1.0,city_lights,"Not only is the film funny, but it contains a great measure of poignancy. End scene is *the* most moving in cinema."
1.0,city_lights,Classic silent cinema from a great pantomime. The resolution with City Lights may be one of the best in cinema. A funny and charming narrative with the beautiful Virginia Cherril.
1.0,city_lights,"Bellissimo. La scena finale è la più commovente della storia del cinema. E' divertentissimo, ma è anche drammatico, è romantico ma è anche impegnato, la musica (dello stesso Chaplin) è incredibile; c'è tutto, manca solo il sonoro ma non ci si fa proprio caso..."
1.0,city_lights,"One of those shows which directors repeatedly pay homage to, and deservingly so. The acting, comic timing, visual gags, and the lovely lovely ending make this timeless. And the boxing match is arguably one of the best comic scenes ever."
1.0,city_lights,Chaplin's most emotionally rich film. The final scene is a tearjerker.
1.0,city_lights,"This seems to be considered Chaplin's ""masterpiece"" by many, but my favorite is still Modern Times."
1.0,city_lights,"La mejor historia de amor se cuenta en silencio. Definitivamente una de las peli­culas que uno debe ver para decir ""yo he vivido""."
1.0,city_lights,Absolutely priceless...This film set the bar for all romantic comedies to come and very few (if any) have managed to live up to it.
1.0,city_lights,"tho i still think ""Modern Times"" is Chaplin's best...this one nearly ties it.....an absolute must see..the scene where the cat knocks the pot onto Chaplin's head while he sniffs the girl's flower is HILARIOUS...also the boxing match-PRICELESS..and then of course the tearjerker ending =masterpiece"
1.0,city_lights,Beautiful! I haven't been able to stop thinking about it.
1.0,city_lights,"Whatever superlative you like, use it."
1.0,city_lights,"It may be a silent movie, but the movie speaks volumes."
1.0,city_lights,A silent movie so good that even my 9 and 5 year olds love it.
1.0,city_lights,simply amazing. the ending truly is one of the greatest in cinema
1.0,city_lights,"Excellent Charles Chaplin film. Behind 'Modern Times' and 'The Great Dictator' for me, but it was amazing. One of the simplest definitions of a romantic comedy before the genre lost its touch along the way."
1.0,city_lights,"If the ending doesn't make you cry, you have no soul.Endlessly brilliant, funny, and so delightful; no matter how many times I watch it, it remains fresh, and further proves the genius of Charles Chaplin."
1.0,city_lights,My favorite Chaplin film. Everyone should see this movie about Chaplin's love for a blind flower girl and his attempts to get money from a drunken millionaire to restore her eyesight. The boxing scene is classic Chaplin and the ending is sure to bring a tear to your eye.
1.0,city_lights,THE LAST MINUTE.OH MY GOD.
1.0,city_lights,Chaplin's best film. An absolute joy to watch. One of the most poignant love stories as the Tramp tries to woo a blind flower girl. The ending is pure gold and brings a tear to my eye.
1.0,city_lights,"Arguably Chaplin's greatest silent, ""City Lights"" is a true masterpiece. With the universal message that love is blind, ""City Lights"" is a comedy that could make you cry (if you're the type--I personally never cry during movies)."
1.0,city_lights,"Saw this in my film class and enjoyed it quite a bit. Charlie Chaplin was hilarious, but the scenes with his crush were what stood out for me. Just a great movie overall."
1.0,city_lights,"Perfection in pantomime. Absolutely the best film ending, ever!"
1.0,city_lights,Beautiful romantic comedy
1.0,city_lights,Funny and sweet. A beautiful film all around.
1.0,city_lights,Comic gold. Charlie Chaplin was a genius. Absolutley splendid.
1.0,city_lights,"It made me smile from start to finish. The final scenes are both shattering and heartwarming and perhaps one of the most romanticly brilliant in film history. If you see it, it will touch your heart for a long time...."
1.0,city_lights,"One Of Chaplin''s Best films, amusing comedy sets up SPECTACULAR ending"
1.0,city_lights,Hilarious as well as touching; the ending is pure perfection.
1.0,city_lights,"Funny, touching, brilliant. One of the greatest film endings ever. I love this movie."
1.0,city_lights,One of the best Chaplins of all time. Also was listed as the top romantic movie according to the AFI. The boxing scene is also one of Chaplin's most classic+hilarious gags. Just a phenominal piece of movie making.
1.0,city_lights,I'm a big fan of Chaplin and hadn't seen it yet. When I saw recently that it was chosen as AFI's top romantic comedy of all-time I figured I was really missing out. I was right. It's a sweet story with great performances.
1.0,city_lights,His final smile is priceless. Chaplin shows more romantic passion here than most other movies without the benefit of a single spoken word. Timeless.
1.0,city_lights,One of my absolute favorite movies.
1.0,city_lights,Nobody does it better.
1.0,city_lights,Beautiful story... still fresh!

1.0,city_lights,Toda la pelicula y en especial la escena donde la cieguita confunde al vagabundo con un rico son geniales
1.0,city_lights,"AFI recently named this the greatest romantic comedy of all time. I agree. This movie combines pathos and comedy in a completely unique way. Probably the best final scene of all time in a movie. If you only see one silent film in your life, this would be the one to see. Long live the Tramp!!!"
1.0,city_lights,A very cute love story!
1.0,city_lights,One of the greatest movies ever made!
1.0,city_lights,"One of my new all-time favourite films. Has one of the best, most romantic tearful, endings ever. The best of the phenomeon that was Charlie Chaplin."

1.0,city_lights,"I'll admit, my exposure to silent film is limited, but nothing I've encountered thus far has matched the heart, soul, warmth, and whimsy of the Tramp's loving quest to help a blind flower girl. Beautiful."
1.0,city_lights,"One of the classic Chaplin films! I love chaplin's great ability to do all those cool moves. Of course, it can't possibly be better than Modern Times."

1.0,city_lights,The ending of this movie always makes me cry.
1.0,city_lights,I love this film so much. It is the best from Chaplin.
1.0,city_lights,amazing funny and much better than many films today! very original
1.0,city_lights,"Chaplin, come ha fatto Benigni con LA VITA E' BELLA, riesce a toccarci in cuore cosi' puramente attraverso la commedia. Il suo personaggio Il Tramp e' puro e sincero in ogni sua azione di tenereza, pericolo, malinteso. Alla fine di questo film, lei veramente riesce a vedere lui!"
1.0,city_lights,The most touching scene in movie history is at the end of this film...if you are not moved to tears when you see it you must not have a heart
1.0,city_lights,"The best of Chaplin's many masterpieces. It's just impossible not to love. Short, sweet, and memorable, like the best silents."

1.0,city_lights,"The best love story I have ever seen. If the last scene doesn't make you cry, you must bleed ice-water."
1.0,city_lights,"Chaplin is the city lights. He saved the millionaire and helped the blind girl. The irony is that the millionaire never recognize him and the girl cannot see.  At closing, the girl reunited Chaplin via a touch of hand. How sentimental."
1.0,city_lights,Uma das melhores atuações do Chaplin!
1.0,city_lights,Chaplin's masterpiece.
1.0,city_lights,A very good classic black and white movie. It is sad and hopeful. I would really like to know what's happening AFTER the end. (My daughter's favourite part is the boxing game. She is 5 years and loves Charlie Chaplin.)
1.0,city_lights,La mejor pelicula de Chaplin. Logra el perfecto equilibrio entre lo comico y lo patetico y tiene un final que le partira el corazon al mas duro.

1.0,city_lights,"A truly amazing feat in film. So many memorable and hilarious scenes, not to mention some knockout performances and a truly heartfelt story at its core."
1.0,city_lights,Boxing scene is the higlight for me

1.0,city_lights,I love Chaplin... if only I could have been alive in his era.
1.0,city_lights,"I've seen my share of silent films but this was my first Chaplin. I can see why he is considered a comedic genius. This film was a masterpiece of visual storytelling, and very funny."

1.0,summers_tale,"a film full of beautiful scenery, long sequences, overwhelmingly naturalistic. Rohmer gets the best of it."
1.0,summers_tale,A Rohmer masterpiece that reveals youthful love and desire and the choices people must make.
1.0,summers_tale,"Wonderful, possibly Rohmer's most welcoming film and one of his best."
0.0,summers_tale,I love Rotten Tomatoes but this time it was unbelievably wrong. Two hours of nonsense shot using a cellphone camera from 2005. Watched it with a wonderful lady from Belgium on a rainy Sunday evening and both of us were disappointed and relieved when the movie was over.
1.0,summers_tale,"I love when he needs to choose and I love his choice. And if you really get into this movie, it's obvious that he was worrying so much and at the end he knew what to choose! I loved this movie, it intrigued me and kept me interested."

1.0,summers_tale,"L'histoire d'un jeune garçon indécis dont la contradiction me rappelle mes années fac, et résume bien mes premiers amours.

1.0,whale_rider,very inspiring and beautiful
1.0,whale_rider,"Can't imagine why anybody would consider giving less than five stars to this gem. Not as widely seen as it should have been, but as with another New Zealand film, 'Once Were Warriors', if you have seen it, you probably already know it's a masterpiece."

1.0,whale_rider,"A masterpiece of what, on the surface, may seem like an overdone theme; Whale Rider touches the deepest of nerves and brings to life the passions about family, culture, tradition, and the need for acceptance by those we love and honor that we all hold in our hearts."
