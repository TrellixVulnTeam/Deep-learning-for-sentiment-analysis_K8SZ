1.0,band_of_outsiders,An exhilarating experience.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"It seems almost silly to write any opinion on such an iconic example of The French New Wave. But, for the record, this disarmingly simple ""little"" movie is filled with so many infamous and puzzling moments -- the sheer charm and absolute coolness of it makes it a great cinematic experience."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Keep Your Youthful Eyes!
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"The most casual Godard film. I enjoyed this so much, Anna Karina is lovely. Everything Godard touched in the 60's was a masterpiece, safe to say. A+"
1.0,band_of_outsiders,That scene in the cafe! That's all I'm going to say. Watch and you will understand.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"As he did with Breathless, Godard pays tribute to the Monogram Pictures like crime drama genre but extends the boundaries of the conventional storyline by filling it with plenty of creative moments that go from the extremes of highly philosophical to silly randomness."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Definitely starting to like Godard now.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"A fun romp filled with robbery, love triangles, dance numbers, and the unforgettable beauty of Anna Karina, this French New Wave feature stands as a near perfect film."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"Godard's most accessible film, a good place for people to start if they're looking to get into his movies (this or Breathless)"
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"so much new wave, so little time."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"I loved this film, it really inspired me in such a weird way."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,One of my favorite Godard films.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,This movie is fantastic and will be able to watch over and over!
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"Great heist film gone bad, excellent acting and fantastic directing by Jean Luc Godard."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"Gosh i love Godard Films the Perfect Combination of Gangster Movie, Humour, Romance, Paris Street Life, Experimental Filmmaking and a Charming Soundtrack and Anna Karina is so sweet and Claude Brasseur & Sami Frey are a funny Duo"
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Fun. Stylish. Clever. Seductive.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Why I'm I even writing this...who reads it really?... Anywho...this movie is excellent. Like WOW! It caught me off guard...watch it twice back2back
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"A unique genre-busting movie that's part romance, part comedy with a dash of heist movie. Lots of fun moments throughout and the three leads are the pure embodiment of awesome. The dancing scene is one of the best scenes ever caught on film. Definitely a classic."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,I know Hetra will hate me for blurbing about this movie but I love it. Subtle comedic nuances in form and a crime plot line makes for a great blend and enjoyable watch.
0.0,band_of_outsiders,so bad i had to turn it off. i would give it a negative rating if i could.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"Very poetic. My first Godard-Karina film, and I was so impressed the first time I saw it."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Like fuckiiin... whoa.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"An indelible piece of work. One of Godard's more accessible films, and one of his best."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"Very poetic. My first Godard-Karina film, and I was so impressed the first time I saw it."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Godard & Anna Karina. Nouveau vague never looked so enticing.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"A masterpiece by one of cinema's true mavericks. Inspriring, delightful and poppy. The dance scene is simply hilarious."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Godard is on fire when making this little heist moive.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Hymne a la liberte du cinema.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"My favourite Godard filme. A young and dreamer girl...you can see it through Karinas' eyes! She's perfect in this film. Such a simple and at same, unique story. Beautiful moments like the dance scene."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"Not the most innovative release from Godard, but certainly one of his films that you can actually smile at. Anna Karina is a knockout!"
1.0,band_of_outsiders,bello...quando c'Ã¨ poi la scena in cui ballano..
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"Pure anarchic cinematic joy as Godard tackles Dolores Hitchens' Fool's Gold and for once laughs with his audience as he explores the space between the text and the image. Anna Karina was never more captivating and Godard presciently observes ""China will win."""
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Cool and detached. Maybe the inevitable future of relationships.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,this is the one of the films that made the pictures show as an art. this is one of the most uniq film that ever made.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,2 words: Anna Karina
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Godard y Ana ....without words...
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"Innovative, enthralling and beautiful. One of the most influential films of all time. As wonderful today as it was when it first released over 40 years ago."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,one of Godard's best
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"A simple tale filled with depth only surpassed by that of Karina's eyes. This tale of two young frenchmen who take advantage of a young girls naivete is filled with so many classis moments, it has been an inspiration to many directors since."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,MY NEW FAVORITE MOVIE.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"Amazing, now I see where Tarantino gets a lot of his ideas from!"
1.0,band_of_outsiders,I need to learn the Madison.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,I need to learn the Madison.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,This film has taught me that the real action and intimate moments in film are when things are left unsaid. Godard creates a connection to his characters that is instantly recognizable and moving. Pure filmmaking at its finest.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,This is easily my favorite Godard film. It's energetic and it feels fresh even today.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Insane. Gotta love Godard.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"Absolutely, mind-blowingly perfect."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Absolutely fantastic! A pure cinematic treat for those who are fans of Godard or new to his work.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,I love it. Amelie would not exist without this.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Epic picture for movie lovers. Modern cinema owes a lot to this movie. This has gotta be the most charming crime/drama I have ever seen.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Bursting with energy and filled with so many classic moments. Just a joy to watch.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Jean-Luc Godard is so damn awesome.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,I want to live in this world.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"Truly one of the most rewarding movies of all-time. One of the most stylish, sly films of all-time, and one of the great works of postmodernism in the history of the art form. A film that is a joy to revisit. Truly of Godard's masterworks."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"Terrific work that impresses with the ability to convey emotions effectively, while literally dismantling the rules of movie making with each passing scene. And, Anna Karenina! Wow!"
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Plays like an interesting character study until you as the viewer realize that the storyteller (Godard) has actually been lying to you for the entire film. His handling of this deception is one of the many elements that make this film a classic.

1.0,band_of_outsiders,Better than Breathless in that in this film it is found an inspiration that I see a theme developed in films released today. Must be seen by any film enthusiast.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,the extended ending could have ruined his entire career
1.0,band_of_outsiders,This movie was fantastic. I wanted to watch it again after I finished it. It's so great to watch films that inspired so many film makers today. And I want to learn The Madison. It's beautiful and complex and brilliantly done.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"My favorite Godard film, that dance scene makes me smile every single time. Very cool stuff."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"Well, Tarantino ripped him off, but that does not detract from the fun and jazz of this seminal Godard film. When the trio dance The Madison in the roadside cafe, I can only wish I'd been born 10 years earlier."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"""cool"" es la palabra para definir esta pelicula, o cualquier trabajo de Godard."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"It was my first Godard and my first French New Wave film!It is held near and dear to my heart. This film, in my opinion, is one of the finest films ever made and doesn't have a single flaw in it.I love Anna Karina. I love Jean-Luc Godard. I love French New Wave. I love BAND OF OUTSIDERS."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,The best the very best of Godard. See it!
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"I love it!!! Every minute is wonderful. It is so memorable and quirky, and the characters are sharp and believable. And there are some truly great scenes(the dance scene, the louvre, etc...); then again, the whole movie is great!"
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Easily one of Godard's best films.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"French is spoken, fedoras are worn, eveyone is lit through a haze of smoke, and there is a musical sequence. Of course, I love this movie."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,One of my all time favorites. A wonderful story about the captivating beauty and ultimate consequence of naivety. It is interesting to see all three characters possess an innocent quality in varying degrees.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,I love movies that have a larger than life style. Band of Outsiders is definitely one of those flicks. Godard is god!!!
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Long live French cinema!
1.0,band_of_outsiders,This is the first Godard film I've seen so I can't compare it with his others but I was particularly mesmerized by the cafe scene. Anna Karina is beautiful in her innocence and desire to be saved from a mundane life.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,wow! really really cool!
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"Dancing in the cafe, the entire soundtrack cutting out during the moment of silence, running through the Louvre. There are just so many great parts to this film."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Weird little French crime drama with some twists. I love the scene where they all just stand up and start dancing in the empty cafe.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"Arthur sucks, so it's cool that he DIES"
1.0,band_of_outsiders,This was cool. Cooler than cool.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"Godard is cool ,Godard is playful ,Godard gave us Tarantino."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,My favorite Godard... by far!
1.0,band_of_outsiders,my favorite godard film.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"A nearly perfect film - an energetic romp through relationships, Paris, love, laughter, and life. This film captures the zeal for life and is edited so modernly that it doesn't seem to have aged at all. I love the part where they run through the Louvre - classic."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Vive le French New Wave. The Maddison dance & 9 mins run through the LOuvre are still bizzare and genius. Anna Karina is beautiful.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,One of my favorites by Godard. I wish I were in that dance scene.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,MI CINTA FAVORITA DE GODARD. PURA LIBERTAD Y ROMANCE. LA SECUENCIA DEL BAILE ES UNA EXCUSA PERFECTA PARA VIVIR.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"Fun movie that takes film making lightheartedly. Includes some very iconic scenes, from the Madison dance to the race through the Louvre."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,One of my Favorites.Masterpiece.Watch the dancing scene.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"Not Godard's cleverest. Nor bravest. Nor arguably even his best . Jean Luc at his most wistlful, then. At his most sublime. At his most beautiful. The Madison dance number will last forever."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,i can't see how tarantino can suck so much with such great influences
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"Very stylish, my personal favorite of Godard's work. Comically tragic, with a whimsical tone of jazz. It blends carelessness with the reckless pieces of modern romance, crime, and attitude. One of my favorites."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"A Godard souffle, very much along the lines of Une femme est une femme. Many lovely, funny moments. There's a pretty profound examination of masculine posturing in there to boot."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"One of the greatest movies of all time, and a truly flawless film."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"Jean-Luc Godard has never made a better film, and he probably won't."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,my second favorite godard that ive seen

1.0,band_of_outsiders,best dance scene evvvvvvvvvvvver
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Godard is amazing. This is possibly my favorite of his films. Right up there with breathless.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"A fun romp, a powerful meditation on loss of innocence, and a fascinating exercise in deconstruction and Brechtian self-reference. And no one does cool like the French do cool."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Anna Karina is fabulous in this movie. Can someone please teach me the Madison dance?
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Yet another classic that should be seen. Wonderful cinimitography and acting as well.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"A nice loopy film, great fun, great cinema, everything comes together easily."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Every film buff must see this film.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,I'm suprised how much I enjoyed it! Probably one of the best dance scenes ever too.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"Of all Godard's films this is the one where his experiments really work perfectly without distracting or confusing. Sweet, mysterious, and perfect."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"Absolutely great, dancing the madison, running through the Louvre, is just awsome"
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"Possibly my favourite Godard Film, certainly his most entertaining."

1.0,band_of_outsiders,A minute of silence can last a long time.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"smooth and classy Godard, what's not to love about this film? Its bold and engaging, including the 1 min silence. Random fun"
1.0,band_of_outsiders,It's like Godard is going through the motions of making a pulp crime movie in order to make a brilliant existential romp.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,an immediate favorite.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"A Band Apart Tarantino & Bender called their production company for Pulp Fiction, wishes they could mack like JLG back in the day. well, they gave it a pretty good go. ""All style and no substance"" mr. souza? Are you related to Dinesh, by any chance? watch more godard, honey."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,A must for anyone who says they're even vaguely interested in film
1.0,band_of_outsiders,The closest thing to a screwball comedy from the great Goddard. Learn how to race the the Louvre in five minutes.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"meybe the best Godard. a witty film, with a sentimental touch. funny, sad, exiting. even if you hate the mad frenchman, give this one a chance."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"I fell in love with Croc-Odile. Godard made a freakin' awesome folk film, a movie for the youth to its very core. The music, the camera, and the dancing made this movie so beautiful. What beautiful characters this movie has."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"One of my favorite films, and is Jean-Luc Godard classic."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"In one hundred words or less, what can you really write about your favorite movies besides that everyone who hasn't seen them really should?"
1.0,band_of_outsiders,It's Godard...no further comments are required.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Anna Karina and a Michel Legrand soundtrack. What more do you need?
1.0,band_of_outsiders,...the Master!...inspiring other Great films directors....this is a monumental film.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"Godard playing fast, fun, and youthful with nary a hint of politics. Epitomes of cool evidenced throughout."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,I'd say this is my favorite Godard film. So much fun.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"Possibly the greatest film ever made. Incredible playing with sound, dialogue, background music being turned off, the most fantastic dance scene - I could go on"
1.0,band_of_outsiders,One of the greatest movies ever!
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Godard is so crazy. He is so fucking crazy. But I love him.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,nouvelle vague at its finest.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"De lo mejor....Godard junta 2 de las mejores cosas que ha visto nacer el cine, la Nouvelle Vague y el cine de delincuentes, en un clásico hermosísimo....que hermoso personaje es Odile..."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"I really miss the film noise from the VHS version. Still, an amazingly fun film. If I'm ever in France, I'm going to try and beat that time through the Louvre."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,This is THE '60s French film.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"I feel like Godard made a time machine, went to the future, became my best friend, then went back, and made a movie just for me. This is perfect. Everything a movie should be."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"For the Madison, for Anna Karina's eyes..."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Gotta love the Godard. Just gotta. And Karina is so damn beautiful.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"Clever, lighthearted, and witty. I absolutely love Godard. Great everything."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"From Jean-Luc Godard, that's quite enough, right? I do think it's even better than Jules et Jim."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,See it just for the sequence in the cafe.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,My favorite film from the French New Wave. Godard has done a brilliant interpretation of the American crime drama. Anna Karina was the world's greatest movie star of the 1960's
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"If I could just see one movie before I die, this one would be it!"
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Such an influential film. My favorite of the French New Wave Movement.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"This movie is .....OMG, i can't even put it into words. I just love this film. And the dance scene,.....best dance scene EVER!!!!!! But the story goes by very fast. I had to go back a couple of times and watch some part of the film a couple of times."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,For the subway/train scene alone I can say this is one of my favorite films of all time.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,My favourite Godard.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,This is an enjoyable art-house film.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,This film beautifully depicts who i suspect Charlie and I will become in eight years or so.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"The dancing sequence is the French equivalent to Gene Kelly's dance in ""Singin' In the Rain."" Easily one of my favorite films."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,paved the way for tarantino.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"Before Pulp Fiction, there was Godard."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,i could dance the madison forever.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"Classic Godard, classic french new wave. It has the 2 guys and a girl hopelessly in love whether romantic or platonic, a plot of situations and dialogue, and beautiful dialogue even through subtitles. Not to mention one of the best scenes of all time when dancing to the jukebox."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"sprø humor, bra dans"
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Nouvelle Vague is the life of this movie. I absolutely loved it the first time I saw it and then the second time when I watched Quentin Tarantinos entire oeuvre! The title is even the name of his production company! Godard strikes gold again.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"I love this film. Jean-Luc along with Truffaut and the other autures of ""Nouvelle Vague"" stole back cinema from the conforming past. Beautiful."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,A masterpiece about the activities of bored young twentieth century people. I showed this one to my students too. The scene where they dance the Madison in the cafe is one of the greatest moments in movie history.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"One of the best French New Wave films...catch the Madison Dance sequence, it is very familure...."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,this movie ends perfectly...or at least how that is what i think.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Now Watch Y Tu MAma Tambien.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"If a couple of friends and I decided to finally pull of a heist (and we've discussed it, too), it might go down something like this..."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"Seriously, everytime I watch this movie, I want to relegate myself to a life of petty crime. Just for the sake of immortalizing myself in the idea of being cool."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"wow. amazing. the scene where they are dancing and when they cut out the sound are fantastic, as is the whole of it."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"One of my all-time favorites: a playful and intelligent exploration of youth, desire, and the bonds of friendship. The scene in which the friends run through the Louvre is brilliant."
0.0,band_of_outsiders,Unwatchable... incredibly boring.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,MAkes me wanna learn the Madison. Wow.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,this movie is brilliant.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,This is the best Godard film I've seen so far. Unlike some nouvelle vague films I've seen this one has a concrete plot so it's more engrossing. I really got into the characters.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"omg, i heart anna karina, dancing sequences, and really long death scenes. a nd semi frey is amazingly hot."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"If you don't like this film, you don't like FILM."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,The dance and the moment of silence are among Godard's most inspired moments.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"My favorite Godard. Classic scene after classic scene, and Karina is a goddess."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"They had me at the English class letters. Full of classic CLASSIC scenes, like only a genius could frame."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"Godard himself said it best in his closing narration, this is a film with ""neither limits nor contradictions""; unabashed pulp with a wild streak, just as Godard hits the peak of celluloid joy, he pauses to show us beauty, and we're suddenly right back again. There's nothing like it."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,This movie just oozes coolness. Like Tarantino but better.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Godard. Enough said. What a work of art!
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"An awesome film (Tarantinos favorite, he named his production company after the french title). Godard is masterful with the camera and his story is great."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,so intelligent. cant help but feel cool.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Great fucking movie.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,One of my favorite films of all time... classic
1.0,band_of_outsiders,I love this movie. Jean Luc-Godard is a master.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Cutest(and longest) dance scene I've ever seen.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"Still my favorite Godard movie, a third viewing of Band of Outsiders really highlights some of the sadness in the film."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,that minute of silence sequence is pretty memorable. reminds me of pulp fiction.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,French cinema at its finest.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Undeniably cool; so much so that the Jack Rabbit Slim's scene in Pulp Fiction has been acknowledged by QT as a direct descendant from the Madison dance sequence of this film.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Anna Karina é paixão eterna. Não é surpresa Godard ter prestado como cineasta apenas enquanto esteve casado com ela e quando ainda se dava bem com o Truffaut.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"Breathless is the more famous Jean-Luc Godard/French new wave movie but this is the greatest. It has a frenzied, hyperactive feel long before Scorsese and Tarantino harnessed a similar style."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"What I consider to be Godard's best film. Plus, I love the Ma"
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Before seeing this film I didn't even think some of this stuff was possible in a movie.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Godard is a master. He does things in this film that you think would never be done in a film. Another favorite of mine.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"PERFECT, pure french new wave. LOVE the story, the cararcters, the mood n' the unforgettable dance sequence."
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Best of the best. In my top 5 of all time.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,Definatly one of my all time favourite films. It's so cool and sexy. It makes me want to go and some and dance somewhere I shouldn't! I think this is Godard's best film.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,A brilliantly directed neo-realist film that was one of the pioneers of the French New Wave revolution. Has inspired millions of artists.
1.0,band_of_outsiders,"Sorry for no reviews, I've just got too many movies and so little time."
1.0,1012928-m,"Lang's haunting masterpiece has much in common with another cinematic treasure, 'The Night of The Hunter'"
1.0,1012928-m,"One of the best suspense films of all time. If you haven't seen this, you should. 1001 movies to see before you die."
1.0,1012928-m,"You have to be an Avengers-spoiled brat to not like this. This is absolutely phenomenal for its time. The fact that it's relevant and great still, shows that this is a true masterpiece."
1.0,1012928-m,This movie is sooo good. How can you not like a movie this? M is one of those classics that will always stand the test of time. Definitely deserves a re-watch.
1.0,1012928-m,"Suspenseful, emotional, gritty, this movie has it all. A story about a child murderer is so gut-wrenching, yet so good."
1.0,1012928-m,Surprisingly sordid for its time.
1.0,1012928-m,"A rare nail-bitting soul-searcher, ""M"" still stands as one of the greatest films ever made for cinema. Director Fritz Land and actor Peter Lorre help deliver a timeless Masterpiece."
1.0,1012928-m,"Amazing. Simply an incredible film. Pete Lorre in his best performance is disturbing and somehow tragic. Masterfully made. It says a lot that a movie this old, is still more effective than most movies these days..."
1.0,1012928-m,A tour-de-force of directing that I really need to rewatch.
1.0,1012928-m,Perfect proto film noir/mystery/social commentary. Most entertaining game of cat and mouse ever depicted.
1.0,1012928-m,De lo mejor que he visto en my life
1.0,1012928-m,"Police procedural, thriller, indictment of society . . . Lang is doing so many things so well at once it's enthralling. That a nearly 85 year old movie is still relevant isn't entirely surprising, that it may still be controversial, is."
1.0,1012928-m,Still as shocking today as it was 80 something years ago.
1.0,1012928-m,"Masterful in every respect, M provides a scathing indictment of mob mentality and the ultimate negligence of those who wish to proceed by way of emotion rather than reason, a universal message as relevant today as it was back in 1931."
1.0,1012928-m,"-IGNORE THIS ""OUT OF FIVE"" RATING4/4Chilling early talkie about a child murderer put on trial by citizens, not the law. Fascinating psychological thriller asks not to sympathize with its killer, but to understand him. Peter Lorre is still great, many famous scenes, and yep, one of the greats."
1.0,1012928-m,Ground breaking and the creation of the psychological thriller. This is truly a masterpiece which will live in history.
1.0,1012928-m,The first definitive psychlogical thriller.
1.0,1012928-m,"Fritz Lang's M stands as a landmark psychological thriller that dares to sympathize with a child murderer who can't help himself. Lorre's debut is one for the ages, and over 80 years later, this landmark looms large over every psychological made. Beyond Essential."
1.0,1012928-m,Considering how this film floored me! I can't begin to imagine how it floored audiences in 1930's whom were totally unprepared for such a disturbing theme and genuinely frightening performance!
1.0,1012928-m,Shot him like a mad dog!
1.0,1012928-m,Just never equaled. Peter Lorre's interpretation remains a must see. Absolutely no mistake in the staging. How is it one cannot stage and/or perform movies like that piece of art more than 80 years later
1.0,1012928-m,"Possibly one of the greatest films ever photographed. As always, I'm rendered speechless by Fritz Lang's modern cinematic vocabulary. Such an artist ahead of the curve, and by decades. Stunning cinema, even 80+ years later."
1.0,1012928-m,Gets better with each viewing.
1.0,1012928-m,My fourth favourite film of all time. Needs to be seen by all. Indescribable perfection.
1.0,1012928-m,Brilliant film. Explores the murders from a different perspectives good storyline. Great directing. Eerrily good.
1.0,1012928-m,"Fritz Lang's incredibly haunting and tragic murder-mystery is more emotionally and politically potent than the majority of films...period, to be frank, and it is only heightened by the lack of soundtrack."
1.0,1012928-m,masterpiece... nothing less.
1.0,1012928-m,"I was surprised at how little Lorre was in this until the end. The whole Mob vs. killer aspect was very interesting, and the ending is pretty great. Probably the darkest movie made for the next 30 years or so, really ballsy and powerful subject matter for an early sound movie."
1.0,1012928-m,cristoddio peter lorre me lo sogno stanotte.

1.0,1012928-m,Fritz Langs landmark film is a masterpiece with a capital M. The cinematography and the atmosphere is just fantastic as well as the performances especially from Peter Lorre who is just phenomenal in his role. The ending scene belongs to some of the greatest scenes in cinema history.
1.0,1012928-m,Very interesting movie indeed! The dubious actions preformed by the lead actor (Peter Lorre) made me pop my monocle.

1.0,1012928-m,"A milestone psycho-thriller with striking cinematography, profound social views, and a great performance from Peter Lorre."
1.0,1012928-m,"This is Peter Lorre`s best performance. He is totally captivating in the pain he exudes as criminal who utterly detests his own crimes, yet there is nothing sympathetic about this pathetic character. Lorre plays this character as only he could... brilliantly!"
1.0,1012928-m,"Probably Fritz Lang's greatest film, and one of the best psychological thrillers i've ever seen. M is haunting, suspensful and it's complex story keeps you thinking throughout the entire movie. I highly recommend it."

1.0,1012928-m,Throw such trashes like A Clockwork Orange straight to the dust bin where it should belong ha
1.0,1012928-m,"Clever, gripping, and emotional. M touches on more than simply murder, but the repercussions and reactions that are part of the process. An excellent film on the study of people and their thought process during a time of horror and hunting for the killer."
1.0,1012928-m,Intelligent and evergreen!

1.0,1012928-m,"One of the first psychological thrillers, and dare I say, the absolute best. One of the most powerful performances from Lorre and Franz Becker. Not to mention the STUNNING imagery, the best imagery from a murder/thriller at least. This is the epitome of German cinema."
1.0,1012928-m,"Both creepy and fascinatingly deep, ""M"" features some of the most memorable scenes to ever grace the world."
1.0,1012928-m,One of the best movies I have ever seen. Incredibly story arc and incredible performances all around. It is just ingenious at every turn. Hands-down one of the greatest films of all time.
1.0,1012928-m,Done unlike any other movie I have ever seen. Suspenseful entertaining with a totally different structure for plot. Peter Lorre pulls of desperation like no other.
1.0,1012928-m,Very good and interesting movie. Excellent especially for the time it was made.

1.0,1012928-m,all the town's criminals are tired of being constantly harassed by police because of a child killer on the loose. so they all get together to find him themselves. a cool premise and a very well done film
1.0,1012928-m,Fritz Lang's legendary picture is notable for its superb construction of fear and excitement...Peter Lorre gives a greatly ambiguous performance as the child killer that strikes fear in pre-war Berlin.
1.0,1012928-m,Innovative in it's use of sound. Peter Lorre gives a perfect performance - unfortunately it haunted the rest of his acting career
1.0,1012928-m,'M' is loaded with memorable images and a stillness in the sound gives us one of the rarest movie experiences of all time. Much thanks goes to Criterion for bringing back a lost and undisputed classic. The best foreign film ever made and it's tied with 'American Graffiti' as my favorite film.
1.0,1012928-m,Best film ever made.
1.0,1012928-m,The best film with a single letter for its title! It's also quite good apart from that.

1.0,1012928-m,"No wonder this movie is considered one of the best made in history. Fabulous acting, cinematography and plot. Wow."
1.0,1012928-m,"Flawless, totally. It took Hollywood always to catch up with films of this caliber (with the possible exception of ""All Quiet on the Western Front"")."
1.0,1012928-m,"Four years after his smash hit Metropolis, master of German Expressionism Fritz Lang premieres his first sound film, M. Lang uses sound in M not only as a key plot device, but also as a nod to classical music on which the story is based."
1.0,1012928-m,Fritz Lang's legendary picture is notable for its superb construction of fear and excitement...Peter Lorre gives a greatly ambiguous performance as the child killer that strikes fear in pre-war Berlin.
1.0,1012928-m,That whistle tune.....oh monstrosity.
1.0,1012928-m,"Considered as the finest work of Fritz Lang, M delicately profiles a wanted psychopath with stimulating themes and striking complexity that helplessly infects the audience with questions on justice and ethics. Remarkable."
1.0,1012928-m,"Ett mästerverk. Har inte sett den här sedan filmkunskapen i gymnasiet slog det mig. Allt jag egentligen mindes var stämningen och Peter Lorres stora, rädda ögon. Så det kändes lite som att se den för första gången."
1.0,1012928-m,"Expertly made way ahead of its time, extremely chilling and expertly acted. The way it shows how tortured the murder is, and how everyone in the entire town is against him. Must see for any film fan."
1.0,1012928-m,I heard it's the first serial killer movie ever made and it's really interesting the see how the shocking appearance of this psychopath wreaks havoc among all the underworld. It has some remaining feeling and style from the silent movies... ;)
1.0,1012928-m,My favorite film by Fritz Lang. The film to lay down the psychological thriller formula for later generations.
1.0,1012928-m,"A truly dark thriller about the depths of the mind of a serial killer. This movie doesn't rely on violence to get its disturbing point across. It relies on the disturbing Franz Becker character, and its dark atmosphere."
1.0,1012928-m,"It may start a little slow, but man....this movie is pretty damn intense."
1.0,1012928-m,Lorre's finest role.
1.0,1012928-m,Peter Lorre's 1st and best role typecast him for life. He's a childkiller who can't help himself while Police and local criminals (whose activities are hurt by the Police search ) are searching for him. Peter's plea at the end when captured by the criminal element is unforgettable.
1.0,1012928-m,As good as any movie ever made.
1.0,1012928-m,"Amazing. When you consider how much of sound cinema appears to have been - if not invented, then - used so confidently by Lang in 1931, your jaw hits the floor. The story, the treatment, the tone... it's amazingly relevant. We have not come far in 80 years."
1.0,1012928-m,Is tha monster the worst?
1.0,1012928-m,"AWESOME movie! Highly recommended great classic movie, featuring a legend in acting, the fabulous Peter Lorre!! Rent it, download it, buy it - just see it SOON!"
1.0,1012928-m,Great Movie indeed. Peter Lorre performance as a child killer was on the mark. He played it as well as he possibly could in the 1930's. The movie is timeless each movie generation will love this work of art.
1.0,1012928-m,When I finished watching I found myself wondering...when was this filmed? A timeless classic.
1.0,1012928-m,Surprisingly modern with a vicious portrayal of a child hunter from Lorre.
1.0,1012928-m,As powerful a film now as it was 80 years ago
1.0,1012928-m,"Brilliant. The images really struck me, and the script as well. Although I may not have understood all the camera techniques, and some of Peter Lorre's acting reminded me a little too much of ""Arsenic and Old Lace,"" ultimately, it's all genius."
1.0,1012928-m,M.a.s.t.e.r.p.i.e.c.e.
1.0,1012928-m,One of the best movies ever made and like the best Noir ever. And the film is From my favorite director Fritz Lang. Whats not to like? It has an amazing story with all the amazing suspense. Not my kind of story but i really liked this

1.0,1012928-m,One of the best serial killer movies i have ever seen. This movie is shocking because you dont' expect these type of movies to have been made around in this time. I give it four out of four thumbs up.
1.0,1012928-m,A great performance from Peter Lorre. I love how subtle and yet poignant some of the most violent scenes are.
1.0,1012928-m,Very disturbing film which has lost none of its power over the years.
1.0,1012928-m,"A truly chilling piece of German cinema. It's Fritz Lang's greatest work, alongside Metropolis."
1.0,1012928-m,"A clever film by Fritz Lang about a serial killer. The story telling, structure and style of this film are absolutely brilliant. An originator of the genre.(53)"

1.0,1012928-m,"Chilling, thought-provoking, timeless (mostly). Definitely recommended."
1.0,1012928-m,"Fritz Lang's first sound film certainly packs a punch! Peter Lorre is superb as murderer Hans Beckert and the strong supporting cast include colourful characters such as Safecracker and Dicke Lohmann (Tubby Lohmann). Of course, Fritz Lang's directing is faultless."
1.0,1012928-m,"I was blown away. I'm a bit speechless.  Many ideological debates go on in the film, but what makes the film so interesting is that it doesn't take sides in any of them."
1.0,1012928-m,Wow! An early talkie with an excellent sound design. The ability to use sound isn't taken for granted and becomes another character in the film.
1.0,1012928-m,"Lorre's most dramatic performance, and one of his best. If you're a fan of his don't miss this movie. It is both very artsy and very exciting."
1.0,1012928-m,"I'll never look at Peter Lorre the same way again, nor at my fellow man. A very interesting treatment through image of society and its work toward justice."

1.0,1012928-m,Great ending. Amazing for it's time.
1.0,1012928-m,The first serial killer movie in movie history is simply amazing. This is a must see.
1.0,1012928-m,"Frightening, visually poetic, and haunting, M is a nightmare. The end contains some of the darkest humor you'll see on film, although it's also painfully sad. Lorre is fantastic, particularly in those final scenes."
1.0,1012928-m,Lately i 've been finding myself bored of writting reviews... This is a masterpiece anyway...

1.0,1012928-m,"An intense, multi-faceted drama that set the stage (and the standard) for several crime genres even today, and still manages to retain its own uniqueness. Peter Lorre brilliantly plays one of the most dimensional villains cinema has ever seen."
1.0,1012928-m,Excellent Fritz Lang classic thats nothing short of a masterpiece. Peter Lorre is outstanding as a child murderer. This film helped pave the way for films raging Hitchcock films to serial killer films. Its influence and brilliance is readily apparent throughout the film.
1.0,1012928-m,"80 years old, and still stands as one of the great crime suspense films ever made. That's said while ignoring all of the innovations that basically set the rules for making a sound film that are still in use today. If you haven't seen it, well, give it a watch already!"
1.0,1012928-m,A brilliantly paced and structured film. Lorre gives a fascinating performance.
1.0,1012928-m,A dark and relentless thriller that illustrates the mastery of Lang's directoral skills as well as the influence European directors held over the genre.

1.0,1012928-m,"Truly a masterpiece. a stunning and timeless classic from the great Fritz Lang. Peter Lorre does a unforgettable performance as the child murderer Hans Beckert. ""Hans Beckert: I can't help what I do! I can't help it, I can't..."""

1.0,1012928-m,"It's an impeccable film -- a model of psychological suspense and a stunning display of Lang's power and skill. But it's Lorre, in a seamless performance that seems to come from some horrifying source, whose image lingers long after the end of M"
1.0,1012928-m,"""Will nicht, muss! Will nicht, muss!""  the prosecution scene at the end of the movie is really thought-provoking and well-shot. peter lorre does a good job in creating a repulsive, psychopathic killer as well, with spooky popping eyes.."

1.0,1012928-m,This brilliant film is the precursor to every crime drama that would follow. It establishes the procedural police stuff that has become so popular. Peter Lorre's performance is incredible. His work in the final sequence is especially powerful. This film was way ahead of it's time!
1.0,1012928-m,This classic clearly shows what an underrated actor Peter Lorre was in the US - Fritz Lang recognized his talent.

1.0,1012928-m,"Holy Toledo! This film is extremely scary! The leitmotif will always be on my mind, very influential (Fincher, Demme), the amazing use of shadows, the silence, the controversy. It's just a perfect film from beginning to end."
1.0,1012928-m,Close to 80 years ago when Lang made one of the earliest and finest thriller with a storline that is now common place today. A classic.

1.0,1012928-m,A great Masterpiece about a Child Murder who terrorize Berlin the Police who fail to catch him and the Ringbanden (Organized German Crime) who catch him it's a hillarious Parabel on Mass Hysteria
1.0,1012928-m,"I watched ""Metropolis"" and it was good. But this movie is genius. If you're gonna watch just one Fritz Lang movie in your life, watch ""M."""
1.0,1012928-m,"Although the film certainly shows its age in cinematography and editing (an obvious expectation), its strong script, along with Peter Lorre's excellent performance, drastically improve the overall impressive feel of the movie. (In other words, the film is dated, but still well-worth watching.)"

1.0,1012928-m,Le meilleur film que j'aie jamais vu. Tout s'enchaine a la perfection. De A a Z tout est parfait.

1.0,1012928-m,A great film by Fritz Lang! One of my favorites
1.0,1012928-m,Fritz Lang's psychological crime-thriller about the desperate hunt for a child murderer is a brillant film full of suspense about vigilante justice versus law and order. A definite must-see.
1.0,1012928-m,Lang's confidence to make a movie at the start of talkies that still relied so heavily on silent passages showed what a master he was. German expressionism gave birth to film noir and much of that debt goes to Lang and this masterpiece.
1.0,1012928-m,This is my favorite film by silent-film god Fritz Lang. It's also ironically his first talkie. M is a masterpiece and one of the bleakest thrillers I've ever witnessed....Wow.
1.0,1012928-m,Eternal Masterpiece for the Ages...
1.0,1012928-m,"one of the top films from the 30's. shows restlessness in a town when police can't solve a crime, mob mentality takes over. witch hunts & false accusations run rampant. kids disappearing, parents can't let them out of their sight and everybody's losing their mind. it's just a great movie"
1.0,1012928-m,"A true cinematic masterpiece! On his first ""talkie"" film, Fritz Lang hits the nail on the head with this gripping story of intrigue and deception... and about finding morality in the darkest of places."

1.0,1012928-m,"I LOVE THIS FILM!!! Definitely one of the best in the history of cinema. The cinematography is incredible, and Peter Lorre's performance is flawless. M is an absolute masterpiece. Amazing!! A MUST-SEE before you die. ;)"
1.0,1012928-m,Classic expressionist film from Fritz Lang.
1.0,1012928-m,Amazing movie that is unusually dark even by today's standards. The suspense is stupendous! The use of sound is amazing. The court scene near the end is especially powerful. This movie is a masterpiece!
1.0,1012928-m,"Incredibly dark film for 1931, but it does reflect the tensions of the time. Fritz Lang did an amazing job with his first talkie."
1.0,1012928-m,Very few movies can grab you and hold on from the first moment. Yet M succeeds in griping on to you every time you watch it.
1.0,1012928-m,The best noir film ever made. Hands down.
1.0,1012928-m,"Masterpiece. Extremely well-done and eerie. Very ironic, especially the ending. Brilliant film"
1.0,1012928-m,i like this movie probably more than it is healthy to like a movie about a child murderer.
1.0,1012928-m,Brilliant and solid as a diamond.
1.0,1012928-m,"La primera pelicula precursora del thriller, con una increible interpretacion de Peter Lorre, y la mayor expresion del estilo aleman de la epoca. GRANDIOSA"
1.0,1012928-m,"Amazing film, strange story. Great but bleak moral. A must see"
1.0,1012928-m,"All serial killer suspense movies owe everything to this movie. Okay, maybe that is a slight exaggeration but this is one of the best examples of the genre."
1.0,1012928-m,"The Quintessential masterpiece of German cinemma, because it is foreign my generation is missing out on this masterpiece"
1.0,1012928-m,"Seriously creepy, a landmark film."
1.0,1012928-m,cinematically fascinating. Fritz Lang used some shots that were not made popular until Citizen Kane (ten years later)!
1.0,1012928-m,"Fantastic movie and a great example of early sound cinema from Germany. The film deals not only with very dark issues, but also with the problem of retribution, which is just as prevalent today as it was in 1931."
1.0,1012928-m,"Probably one of the most significant films ever made, inspiring genres from serial killer to film noir. M stands for masterpiece and masterclass."
1.0,1012928-m,amazingly brilliant film! I loved the writing and am in total awe of Fritz Lang.

1.0,1012928-m,"For Fritz Lang's first ""talkie"" he is so far ahead of his time with the audio, even if some sound effects are missing, who cares? Sound plays a major role in the film. The opening scene breaks my heart. I like the negative portrayal of the police...but in the end, we can't say who's the bad guy."
1.0,1012928-m,"An amazing movie! It was iconic for its time, and the themes still resonate today. Peter Lorre pulls off a wonderful performance, and Fritz Lang puts you at the edge of your seat."
1.0,1012928-m,This is brilliant! It's a classic. Miami Vice even made an episode based on it. (My second husband was an extra in it.)
1.0,1012928-m,"Peter Lorre is a big baby of a man who murders children. Coupled with Lang's expressionist style, child murder never looked so cool"
1.0,1012928-m,The subtlety is scarier than seeing the gore!
1.0,1012928-m,The director Fritz Lang considered this terrifying and morally complex Masterpiece to be his finest work.
1.0,1012928-m,"Haunting, atmospherical and captivating german horror-crime tale, masterfully crafted by Fritz Lang and starring the ever mesmerizing and intriguing Peter Lorre."
1.0,1012928-m,amazing a masterpiece
1.0,1012928-m,The police and the criminals are out to catch the child murderer. Peter Lorre was a perfect choice for the role of child murderer. Evocative film There are versions with different endings. Try them both.
1.0,1012928-m,Pretty much the best movie ever made.
1.0,1012928-m,Yes yes yes! If only actors were this emotive nowadays...all fakes I tell ya!
1.0,1012928-m,Fritz Lang's 1931 masterpiece about a child murderer who holds a city in a grip of fear has lost nothing of its effectiveness. It is the stuff nightmares are made of. It has been re-released this week on dvd. Don't miss it. This is far more than just cinema: this is revolution.

1.0,1012928-m,Revamped Review forthcoming
1.0,1012928-m,"Great film, has held the test of time, great acting great everything"
1.0,1012928-m,It always amazes me when you see a film made so long ago (77 years!) that still feels current. Some of the camera work is pretty impressive for its time as well. Loved Peter Lorre. Terrifying. Vile. Riveting.
1.0,1012928-m,Very well made. A very interesting story that has it's foundation in eerie truths. Lots of symbolism. The movie comes together very well. Great acting.
1.0,1012928-m,What a great movie.A film about a city getting crazy after several kids are kidnapped and murdered.And this is a film from 1931! - Just a year after films stopped being mute.Amazing!
1.0,1012928-m,La symetrie de la lettre vu dans le miroir pour un meurtrier schizophrenique
1.0,1012928-m,"Golly, people in the thirties smoked alot! greatest serial killer movie ever."
1.0,1012928-m,"Who cares what I have to say, see the damn movie, it's worth your 2 hours to see this kind of filmmaking."
1.0,1012928-m,Amazing film. You nearly don't notice that it's a film from 1931. It's that exciting and suspenseful. And Lorre's fabulous.
1.0,1012928-m,"The first and still, so far BEST movie about a murderer ever made. Brilliant cinematography and amazing acting, put together by a genius director. A movie that should not be missed by anyone."
1.0,1012928-m,"Amazing cinematography, suspenseful storyline (not so much in not knowing the murderer but in what will happen next), and Peter Lorre's first starring role. Great movie."
1.0,1012928-m,Helluva story. Amazingly crafted. Incredible performances...way ahead of its time. Creepy as shit at times.
1.0,1012928-m,The great grand-daddy of all psycho thrillers!
1.0,1012928-m,Brilliantly directed thriller as both cops and underworld criminals hunt down a child killer in Berlin. Breathtaking cinematography plus Peter Lorre's unforgettable performance make this an absolute classic.
1.0,1012928-m,"The first, and best serial killer movie ever made. It hasn't aged one second since it came out."
1.0,1012928-m,"Three cheers for no protagonists, no winners, no trust, and no hope."
1.0,1012928-m,Amazingly good from the cinematography to the acting (Peter Lorre is terrific) to the shades-of-gray morality questions.
1.0,1012928-m,"Hands-down the most haunting film I've ever seen. Made two years before Hitler came to power, it is also a damning critique of Pre-war Germany."
1.0,1012928-m,"Un superbe film efficace, deroutant. Un film vu au lycée que j'ai aime revoir plusieurs fois depuis."
1.0,1012928-m,An absolute masterpiece. As dark and creepy as they come.
1.0,1012928-m,"One the best classic movies ever made, a bit slow paced in the begginning, but gets sooo much better."
1.0,1012928-m,One of the best films I have ever seen.
1.0,1012928-m,A real thriller in time...is that past have passed?!!!
1.0,1012928-m,Lorre and Lang at their best
1.0,1012928-m,uno dei più belli di sempre
1.0,1012928-m,"As creepy as movies come. And even creepier is the clarity of vision that Lang had in seemingly anticipating the rise to power of Hitler and the Nazi party.  Also Peter Lorre's best role: simultaneously sympathetic, pathetic, and horrifyingly evil."
1.0,1012928-m,"A very well though out movie that shows the proces of the police trying to catch a child killer. Very interesting concept, especially for that time period as it seemed as if movies were heavily cnesored at that time. A young Peter Lorre hives a great performance."
1.0,1012928-m,"Peter Lorry's ""mercy! Mercy!"" will forever rattle around in my mind. not often noted in film reviews, M is often sited by historians as a work of art that is meant to portray the dissatisfaction and angst in Wiemar Germany."
1.0,1012928-m,"Hands down my favorite film of all time. The writing, acting, directing was all incredible. This is Fritz Lang's haunting masterpiece. Visually stunning and way ahead of its time."
1.0,1012928-m,"One can see how the great Alfred Hitchcock was influenced by the equally great Fritz Lang by watching M. No need to actually FILM the act of violence; in M, less is much, much more. A fantastic film, and a true classic."
1.0,1012928-m,"There isn't much that can be said about this film that hasn't been said before. This is a grat, important film and I cannot recommend it highly enough."
1.0,1012928-m,"Peter Lorre's a badass, and so is Fritz Lang. I never thought watching a pedophile could be so fascinating. Awesome."
1.0,1012928-m,I wish I knew how to text an eerie whistle.
1.0,1012928-m,CLASSIC! Peter Lorre is amazing at the end! All the corridors and shots through doors really enhanced my empathetic view as everyone closed in around M!
1.0,1012928-m,one of the best movies ever made.
1.0,1012928-m,"The economy, austerity and directness of the films of Fritz Lang made him one of the most profound, and precise filmmakers."
1.0,1012928-m,"One of the best films ever made in any country. Lorre (in his pre-Casablanca/Maltese Falcon, ""Bug-eyed Creepy Guy"" typecasting days) gives the performance of a career and Lang invents cinematic tricks from whole cloth that are still being used 70 years later. ""M"" is for ""must see"""
1.0,1012928-m,Legendary but only in german
1.0,1012928-m,The beginnings of an expressive sound cinema...
1.0,1012928-m,"One of the creepiest movies ever made. Peter Lorre is brilliant as the compulsive child killer. It gets so bad that even the street gangs and mobsters start tryng to track him dowm. The ending with the criminals putting Lorre on ""tiail"" is brilliant"
1.0,1012928-m,An excellent portrayal of both the murderer's mind and the mob's reaction to the horrible events. Hauntingly beautiful camera work and Peter Lorre is amazing.
1.0,1012928-m,Peter Lorre has Hans Beckert the Murderer was perfect match. M for Murder!1334

1.0,1012928-m,"Un film culte pour moi. Peter Lorre est epoustoufflant ! La realisation de Fritz Lang aussi, il, joue des ombres et des lumieres avec talent ! C'est en voyant des films comme ca qu'on regrette le cine en noir et blanc..."
1.0,1012928-m,"Brilliant dark thriller from one of Germany's (and the world's) best directors, and a fascinating insight into the mind of a serial killer. A must for all Daily Mail readers!"
1.0,1012928-m,Peter Lorre Kicks Ass!
1.0,1012928-m,"Certainly one of the greatest films ever made. A standard in film, especially in the serial killer and police drama genres which it defined. Worth seeing again and again."
1.0,1012928-m,"Probable the greatest achievement in cinema until ""Citizen Kane"" ten years later;"
1.0,1012928-m,One of the best movies of this time!
1.0,1012928-m,"This is a must see for any film buff. A very powerful and disturbing story that would cause a stir now, let alone 1931. Incredible directing and acting. It is amazing to see how so many styles and trends in movie-making can trace back to M."
1.0,1012928-m,Best movie ever made?
1.0,1012928-m,One of my very favorite movies!
1.0,1012928-m,Great film about an assassin and his hunting! Suspenseful and with an amazing performance by Peter Lorre. Fritz Lang does it again!
1.0,1012928-m,"M der Murder. Une critique du nazisme, de la collaboration et de la delation (sport national francais et suisse) avant l'heure... J'adore tout Fritz Lang, mais la c'est mon prefere ! La mention a l'excellent Peter Lorre est de mise."
1.0,1012928-m,"This was Fritz Lang's first time using sound in film- that statement needs to be said because it is not seen. Lang is a master at his medium and proved it with his use of sound in the film, M. A breakthrough through all barriers."
1.0,1012928-m,Otra obra magistral de Fritz Lang. Uno de los temas mÃ¡s controverciales en cine mudo.
1.0,1012928-m,"I only watched partial from one of my class, but I already addicted to this movie."
1.0,1012928-m,"I can't stress how much I love this film, nor can I describe why in less than 500 words. If you haven't seen it, watch it."
1.0,1012928-m,"The first and one of the best movies about a serial murderer ever made. Though it is a German film, it's premise can be applied to any culture, and Peter Lorre is really unsettling in the role of the murderer."
1.0,1012928-m,Absolutely brilliant!!!
1.0,1012928-m,"Brilliant, purely brilliant. Fritz Lang sets a wonderful tone, and Peter Lorre delivers a wonderful performance. A much better insight into the mind of the mentally ill than many other films."
1.0,1012928-m,Every time I watch this film I love it exponentially more.Fritz Lang is a god.
1.0,1012928-m,One of the most amazing noir film ever made as well as the first serial killer film. Truly groundbreaking and awesome!

1.0,the_leopard_1963,Excellent film. I learned a great deal about Sicilian history.Burt Lancaster was surprisingly believable as a Sicilian Prince. I could tast the dust and feel the heat in those travel scenes
0.0,the_leopard_1963,Definitely not worth 3 hours...an hour of it must have been the kissing and dancing scenes alone. This movie was wayy to slow paced and drawn out than it needed to be.

1.0,the_leopard_1963,"Just saw Luchino Visconti's Il Gattopardo in a restored print at the George Eastman House this evening...my God, what an experience. Clocking in at just over 3 hours, this epic tale of the last years of a Sicilian Prince during the Garibaldi era.On the surface, it is the story of the end of an age"
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"A little like Gone With the Wind, but set in 1860 Italy during the unification. Martin Scorsese says everyone should see this movie....I agree -- it's pretty magnificent. The 35mm restoration is probably playing at an art house theater near you!"

1.0,the_leopard_1963,"Tragically ironic and wonderful and joyous. Burt Lancaster gives a truly staggering performance, under the superb hand of Visconti.

1.0,the_leopard_1963,Visconti and neorealism in Italy

1.0,the_leopard_1963,"This is Visconti Â´s masterpiece and one of the visually most breathtaking films of World Cinema. Lancaster really is prince Salina. Nino RotaÂ´s sweeping romantic music, a mixture of Verdi and Wagner, heightens the filmÂ´s visual power."

1.0,the_leopard_1963,"The most gorgeous cinema experience of my life, thank God for re-releases. Operatic, epic, sumptuous, a feast, I am only sad that on DVD, this will never come to life. The look is incredible, still today, cause of Visconti's insistence on the real thing rather than props and scenery."

1.0,the_leopard_1963,"Glamour, romance, social commentary, history, family drama, all mixed in this sublime concoction and served cool by Visconti. Watch the Italian version, not the English one."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"One of the most beautiful films ever made, the much famed ball sequence, which takes up the last 1/2 hour is one of the best set sequences ever filmed. The full version is finally available in a subtitled print, however Lancaster spoke English is dubbed into Italian and subtitled back into English!"
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"Class struggles, generational differences and individual morality on Sicily and on a great scale. As awe-inspiring as Gone With the Wind, but at least twice as intelligent."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,certaily the best piece of Burt Lancaster. One of the best films of 60's. And what can be said about Claudia Cardinale.She is the pretiest woman on screen- I guess.
1.0,the_leopard_1963,An absolute gem...what photography...true to the novel in every detail...amazing...but it's Visconti after all...
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"The best way I can describe it, which doesn't do it justice, is the Italian Gone with the wind. However, that's because it takes place during Italy's defining moments. Though the stakes are much more intellectual and thought out than just a tragic love story set against the back drop of war."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"Que delicioso retrato de la aristocracia y de la sociedad italiana. Que claridad para ver las relaciones sociales entre los habitantes del pueblo, entre el pueblo y el poder. La escena del banquete, la figura y la risa espectacular de Claudia Cardinale son inolvidables."

1.0,the_leopard_1963,"Visconti's masterwork feels like a series of Rembrant paintings in motion, all slowly revealing the deterioration of the Sicilian aristocracy through the wrinkled and weary eyes of Burt Lancaster."

1.0,rashomon,A directorial masterpiece about perception which has gone on to be named in academia for the interpretations of events.
0.0,rashomon,"Tiny pearl, overpowering melodrama."
1.0,rashomon,Akira Kurosawa brilliantly portrays how an incident can be told as many different stories from different point of views and none of them coincides with the real truth which is yet unknown even after the movie finishes.
1.0,rashomon,Brilliantly crafted film with a groundbreaking narrative structure and eye opening direction by Akira Kurosawa. Simple yet brilliant set design and beautiful camera technique that changed the medium forever.

1.0,rashomon,Kurosawa sure knows how to tell a story.
0.0,rashomon,I was unfortunately bored out of my mind.
1.0,rashomon,"Rating a classic like this is obviously foolish. Rashomon reminds us that truth is more than facts in the outer world, but what is going on in our own inner worlds."
1.0,rashomon,"Kurosawa's best. A surprising commentary that still seems to reflect even the most modern of times. He provides the story with challenging perspectives, true levels of character flaws, and blind judgment. What we get is a film most human."
1.0,rashomon,"Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece has become a copied plot-line since its release. The ""same story from many perspectives"" is standardized here for subsequent generations to repeat over and over.The film is an excellent tale, and despite it being Japanese, is still quite satisfying to watch."
1.0,rashomon,"This is my best ever life changing film. This is about you looking at the truth in the eye and still wonder if it's a ""FACT""."
1.0,rashomon,"Haunting, beautiful tale of ego, perspective and humanity's flaws. A classic."
1.0,rashomon,"A dark, silent, effective drama flick with you as a character, Kurosawa captivates quickly with his brilliant mind and effective symbolism. I have not and surely will not ever see a movie quite so well themed as Rashomon."

1.0,rashomon,"It is not a great samouraï movie, or a reflexion about the human mind and weakness, or a philosophical story of the humanity's deepest sins, but a true piece of art from Kurosawa."
1.0,rashomon,An incredible masterpiece.
1.0,rashomon,"More than half a decade later, Kurosawa still is relevant as he keeps shaping the visions of generations of filmmakers. And it keeps getting better after each viewing."

1.0,rashomon,One of my favorite Kurosawa movies and an exercise on truth. Beautiful photography.
1.0,rashomon,"Friggin Masterpiece. A murder drama done well to exploit the highs and lows of humanity. painfully misogynistic, but so were those times."
1.0,rashomon,"I can sit here and talk about a film's writing, or character development, or editing and cinematography and just go on a giant spiel, when I could really just say four words. I loved this movie!"

1.0,rashomon,"I don't need to write a review of this. I've been so taken with this film I've watched it 5 times over the course of the week. I've been dumbfounded to find that students in one of my film classes found it boring, slow, and melodramatic."
1.0,rashomon,"i thought this movie was really planned out and a great success. i don't think there was one specific genre. because i did laugh, but there were dramatic parts as well. great movie."
1.0,rashomon,"See the 2008 restored version, as it just looks and sounds incredible. If you have never seen Rashomon, then there's so much to learn about film narative, film technique, and film history. Kurosawa's first (of many) true masterpieces, and every time you watch it, you will see it differently."
1.0,rashomon,Everyone's got a reason to lie........this gets better every time I see it.
1.0,rashomon,"Ho. Ly. Fuck. This movie is truly incredible. The way in which Kurosawa approaches the topic of reality as being entirely subjective is incredible.

1.0,rashomon,"An intriguing story, fantastic acting, and expert directing combine to form another classic from Kurosawa, delivering an indepth look at the idea of truth and the purpose of life and its trials."
1.0,rashomon,"I think this is actually better than seven samurai (there, I said it). more style, more seriousness, more heart, and more thought, I cannot understand why this isn't regarded as Kurosawa's greatest achievement."
1.0,rashomon,"This was my first Kurosawa movie ever. I saw it way back in middle school, and it started my love affair with his films. Almost a ""who dun it?"" that talks about the human condition, if you haven't seen this film go watch it. If you have, go watch it again. your view of it might change."
1.0,rashomon,Kurosawa Japan best. Big-time movie! Yes?
1.0,rashomon,A powerful look at subjectivity.
1.0,rashomon,"Sure, it's not packed with tons of action, but it's very emotional, very suspenseful, and very simple in its presentation which adds an extra element of elegance and sophistication; all with an ending that makes you reflect on your own selfishness. The symbolism and metaphors were tops."
1.0,rashomon,A true masterpiece in all aspects..with unheard of use of camera nddynamic lighting..akira kurosawa's classic is a feast even today..the presentation of story..suspense merged with courtroom drama..inspired countless movies nd has left a legacy.. a must watch for all movie lovers...

1.0,rashomon,"Excelent, one of the best movies by Kurosava , I saw it for first time when I was 8 since that time i saw I couple of times and still amazes me..."
1.0,rashomon,"Blew me away. Akira Kurosawa towers above most other directors in the 20th century and this is no exception. Rashomon is leagues above all other films in the 50's, equaled only by Kurosawa's other classics."
1.0,rashomon,"Not just a masterpiece, it's practically part of the periodic table of cinema."
1.0,rashomon,"My Rating: 95% .  Beautiful, Haunting, Surreal and Bittersweet. Rashomon is a film that is spot on and very true."
1.0,rashomon,"If you've never seen a film by Akira Kurosawa, this is a good start. He also made Throne of Blood, a samurai Macbeth and Ran, based on Shakespeare's King Lear."
1.0,rashomon,Akira's best work! So many filmmakers have tried to capture the essence of this film. Nothing beats the original.
1.0,rashomon,"Fascinating, influential drama which despite its age still has the power to provoke and astonish."
1.0,rashomon,"An exquisitely rendered representation of perception, human brokenness, and the hopeless bravely hoping despite these odds."
1.0,rashomon,"Kurosawa's best...Employs a multi-flashback recounting the same incident, as a plot device.. 60 years on and filmmakers all over the world still get inspired by this classic!!!"
1.0,rashomon,"A timeless masterpiece in world cinema.....and I feel Toshiro Mifune, as Tajomaru the bandit, does a better ""Raavan"" act than Abhishek Bachchan as Beera...."

1.0,rashomon,"""I don't mind a lie, so long as it's interesting,"" says the cynic. Another way to look at it is that everything is true, that the stories don't fit because of what others overlooked in their pride."
0.0,rashomon,"The music in the movie was horrible. The whole thing is black and white, which is terrible. Some of the acting was terribly overacted. The fight scenes were fakey.On top of that, it's a horribly disgusting story.Yep, terrible and horrible describe it best."
1.0,rashomon,"An impressive foreign film that leaves you guessing to the very end. Visually stunning, and so poetic even Shakespeare would have been proud. One of my new favorite films, if you know what a good movie can be without CGI or a big budget, definitely see this film."
1.0,rashomon,"In league with Ikiru, its full of sorrow and mystery."
1.0,rashomon,"It is a testament to Akira Kurosawa that he can get away with risking everything making such an original movie as this. You must remember, in 1950, Rashomon was unheard of."
1.0,rashomon,a Kurosawa Akira film
1.0,rashomon,"Even though it's now coming on sixty years old, Rashomon hasnt aged a day. With its new state of the art digital restoration its never been a better time to catch this masterpiece."

1.0,rashomon,I agree that this is one of the top foreign films of the 20th century.
1.0,rashomon,"Story telling at its absolut best. 4 different versions of the truth. A rape, and a murder in the woods. Each version is an interesting look. It may not be Kurosawa's best but its a great film and had arguably the biggest impact in america of all japanese cinema."
1.0,rashomon,"The film is much less formally daring than its literary source, but its virtues are still plentiful: Kurosawa's visual style at its most muscular, rhythmically nuanced editing, and excellent performances"

1.0,rashomon,if u ask for most influential movie of previous century then rashamon will certainly get a thought.
1.0,rashomon,"Zapravo je odlican film. Odlican je i predlozak po kojem je napisan scenarij. Mislio sam mu dat manje jer ipak gluma nije tako uvjerljiva na zapadnjacki nacin, ali ipak sam na vrijeme odustao od te ideje. Film, naravno, izgleda prekrasno."
1.0,rashomon,"A really simple film with the same story told from different perspectives. I have seen this done in numerous films since, but none have been able to do it this well. The story was gripping, and working out the truth was impossible. Brilliant."
1.0,rashomon,Amazing.That's all. Amazing. See it.
1.0,rashomon,Storytelling doesn't get any better than this. Kurosawa's 'Rashomon' is a master in making the viewer question the truth. The character recaps are told through much creativeness.
1.0,rashomon,"So far, out of the handful of Kurosawa films I've seen, I might say that Rashomon is his most aesthetically pleasing film."
1.0,rashomon,"The villain. The bride. The deceased. The woodcutter. All with a story to tell, the ending no different in each case: a man dies, with the circumstances being lost to bias. \"
1.0,rashomon,Rashomon (1950) is still considered to be a puzzle/ a gimmick ... Explorers deeply the human psyche and IT SHOULD NOT BE MISSED !!
1.0,rashomon,"Thoughtful mediation on perception versus reality using a (then revolutionary) structure that's been tried many times since but ever bested. It's a masterfully made, nearly perfect film, with great sequences and terrific acting (even if Mifune's performance is too big)."
1.0,rashomon,"Good adaptation of 2 of Akutagawa Ryunosuke's short stories, Rashomon and In a Bamboo Grove. A must-read book and must-see movie. Maybe Toshiro Mifune's most aclaimed performance, along with Shichinin no Samurai."
1.0,rashomon,A masterpiece. The 2008 restored version is a must see!
1.0,rashomon,"A very deep film about morality, truth, the ugly side of human nature and eventually hope. Though some may think that Toshiro Mifune overacted his performance I thought it work well for the movie."
1.0,rashomon,Brilliant considering its time
1.0,rashomon,"One of the best Movies ever made, an amazing amusing Movie with great Actors about a Story who was telled by different Persons and they are according different again amazing from how much Views a Picture can be watched"
1.0,rashomon,[2009.07.31 on DVD] Absolutely Masterpiece!!
1.0,rashomon,The film that introduced Kurosawa to the west after the war. Mifune & Shimura are fantastic.
1.0,rashomon,A masterwork of nonlinear narrative.
1.0,rashomon,"Two guys sitting in the rain. There was 3 different version of a story of the same event. It was more about the selfishness and oppurtunistic nature of man. The monk almost loose hope towards humanity, yet a little shade of kindness in the end gave him back the hope he almost lost."
1.0,rashomon,"An insanely clever classic that keeps you guessing throughout the film. The story is told brilliantly from many different angles, ending with a logical conclusion."
1.0,rashomon,i wish I could give it more stars
1.0,rashomon,Perhaps the most ripped off story of the last 50 years. OF course that describes much of Kurasowa's canon. One of the greatest films from one of cinema's greatest directors.
0.0,rashomon,"Well, I was bored to tears. Apparently it's by some director who is supposed to be a genius and everyone is ripping off him, but if that were true - I wouldn't have enjoyed a movie ever. It's old, but that's no excuse for boring me to tears."
1.0,rashomon,AKIRA'S GR8 SCREENPLY EXAMPLE
1.0,rashomon,"As I remember it, this is one of the greatest films of all times."
1.0,rashomon,"One of the most influential films ever made, this film challenged conventional thought about what we see on the screen."
1.0,rashomon,My favorite movie of all time!!!! Five Stars is not enough.
1.0,rashomon,"A must-see. A storyline like nothing the west has ever done before, yet very westernized in the approach. A surprisingly taboo subject for the 1950's, a creepy ""medium,"" and a shocking ending that threw me for a loop. I couldn't understand how someone could possibly not enjoy this movie."
1.0,rashomon,Parang senate inquiry sa sex scandal!
1.0,rashomon,This doesn't quite top Throne of Blood as my favorite Kurosawa movie but it gets close. Really really close.
1.0,rashomon,"A beautiful inquisition into the nature of truth, hidden beneath a simple crime drama."
1.0,rashomon,A perfect movie from one of the world's greatest directors. And the rain! How cleansing!!
1.0,rashomon,"ã?¾ã??çµ?æ§?é?¢ç?½ã??ã?¨æ??ã??ã??ã??a good combo of rashomon and in a grove, as if those stories were ever meant to be combined. anyone who ventures to kyoto might want to check out sanmon if they want the feel for the movie."
1.0,rashomon,"Ah, now this one I can get into! Need to watch it again so I can write a more detailed review, but the idea behind it is great, and it had some parts that really floored me."
1.0,rashomon,The third best Kurosawa film.
0.0,rashomon,I missed the plot and pretty much all the other things in this film because I was too busy trying to stay awake..
1.0,rashomon,"A masterpeice of cinema, by Kurisawa. Toshiro Mufuni highlights this macabre tale of a crime as seen from several diferent points of view. Later inspired numerous films including Hero, and Vantage Point."
1.0,rashomon,"Dates amazingly well, the only 'distance' comes from culture and a theatrical style. As beautifully filmed, absorbing and thought provoking as its reputation."
1.0,rashomon,A classic piece of film.
1.0,rashomon,AWESOME AWESOME a great piece of art.
1.0,rashomon,Classic...Brilliant...
1.0,rashomon,"So this is what a classic looks like? Well, I already know... but yeah, it's amazing."
1.0,rashomon,Kurosawa's examination of truth pretty much proves that he can do no wrong.
1.0,rashomon,An amazing film classic that deals with the perception of truth. The film is beautiful in every aspect with strong characters and direction.
1.0,rashomon,The truth is in the eye of the beholder. More tributes have been made to this movie than possibly any other.
1.0,rashomon,"A classic detective movie!!!Offering some logical explanations for one case.This is a true detective movie.You'll see less act though. Well, you may say it's like a battle of logic."
1.0,rashomon,Awesome movie which tells the same story from multiple points of view. What actually did happen in the woods that day?
1.0,rashomon,This is a perfect movie.
1.0,rashomon,Classic murder mystery.
1.0,rashomon,"Ispirato a due racconti di Akunagawa, il film ha aperto una vera e propria stagione di scoperta del cinema orientale in Italia. Ancora oggi la visione Ã¨ godibile e rappresenta una sfida all'intelligenza e sensibilitÃ  di ogni spettatore! Le riprese della foresta sono indimenticabili."
1.0,rashomon,"I feel like this movie will influence me as a filmmaker a great deal. It really is a film for filmmakers, and covers some deep philosophical ground. I still think Ikiru is his best film, but this movie is still great."
1.0,rashomon,"Excellent movie... if you love movies, you have to see this. Great story, great directing, great everything. 'Truth' is a relative term when several different accounts of the same crime are not only different, but also logically incompatible."
1.0,rashomon,One of Kurosawa's early classic's where so many Directors have copied from. It will not be everyone's cup of tea it is what it is and it is one of Kurosawa's best.
1.0,rashomon,the best story all the time
1.0,rashomon,"There's a reason why Kurosawa got an Oscar for this film. A true journey into human nature and desires, it ends up that the lies told are worse than the actual crime. Absolutely brilliant."
1.0,rashomon,"The best of Kurosawa, and a great story told with passion and great images."
1.0,rashomon,"some very beautiful images in this, and the story itself left me with a great deal to think about. I also really liked the overacting, surprisingly."
1.0,rashomon,"One of the greatest films of all time. Between the stellar performances of Mifune, Shimura, and Machiko Kyo and Kazuo Miyagawa's brilliant cinematography this is one Kurosawa's finest."
1.0,rashomon,"The rain, the unquiet, the viciousness of humanity"
1.0,rashomon,the origianl non-linear samurai film noir
1.0,rashomon,"One of the best films ever made. Peircing examination of the unreliable narrator and spot on with cast, visuals and all else. It is my happy wish that everyone gets to see this movie at least once, it is just a real treat."
1.0,rashomon,"It's a brilliantly complicated piece of work that offers no clear answers, forcing the viewers to make up their own mind as to what it was that happened based on the self-serving testimony of the 4 people involved in the horrific incident in the woods."
1.0,rashomon,"After watching this movie, I still find myself asking what happened in those woods. If you learn anything, it's the complexity of the truth, memory, and human motive."
1.0,rashomon,"Brilliant directing by Akira Kurosawa! Wonderful story that brings up points of human nature, lies, and especially the powerful affect women have on men. Beautiful, and extremely symbolic. A must-see for hard-core movie lovers."
1.0,todo_sobre_mi_madre_1999,"This movie is so fantastic in so many different ways. Words would not do it justice. So please, see it!"

1.0,todo_sobre_mi_madre_1999,"""Todo Sobre Mi Madre"" es una de las obras cumbres del genial director español Pedro Almodóvar. La estética Kitsch, la reverencia al genero ""Noir"", el homenaje a los melodramas, las relaciones edípicas, la sensibilidad femenina... No hay más que decir sino ¡Viva Pedro!"
1.0,todo_sobre_mi_madre_1999,Uma inesquecível obra prima. Há cada segundo melhor.

1.0,project_nim,This is just about as good as a documentary gets. Wonderful and heart-breaking all at the same time. I often wonder if those who abuse animals in this life regress and come back as one of the animals they abused in their next incarnation?
1.0,project_nim,a very sad tale of animal abuse... Nim really only enjoyed the love and friendship of 3 human friends and had a number of human playmates and teachers assigned him. He really shouldn't have been raised and nurtured like a human child.
1.0,project_nim,The saddest and cruelest treatment to an animal!!! Humans are so cruel to everything!
1.0,project_nim,An excellent watch. Highly recommended for anyone who has an interest in how our society affects the world around it.
1.0,project_nim,"Amazing story of a chimp raised as a human and taught sign language to communicate, only to be abandoned later to live in a cage on a compound. Eventually Nim's quality of life improves, but the story remains sad. The footage of Nim's progress as a higher-intelligent chimp is fascinating."

1.0,an_education,"I found this film extremely intriguing as I often wonder what path people would choose when faced with these decisions at such a young age. Choices that we make in our youth often come to hunt us in our old years, no matter what path we decided to take when the opportunity came."

1.0,an_education,I really enjoyed this movie!! I had all the elements. The acting and characters were magically portrayed. This was a sensational movie!!
1.0,an_education,"Amazing, wonderful surprise of a film. Although now the blogs are on fire discussing this movie's ""anti-Semitic"" overtones, one should remember that if you want to find something wrong with the movie, you will.

0.0,1013775-metropolis,i felt like the most interesting thing in the movie was the music. All throughout the movie there is different types of music like fast or mysterious to show something bad is happening or about to happen. The music definetely made the movie a lot more intense.

1.0,1013775-metropolis,"For a good reason, I have never seen any other edits of Metropolis except for (luckily) the new restoration.

1.0,1013775-metropolis,"It is single handedly THE most awe-inspiring silent motion picture I have ever seen. You have to get the restored authorized version that is close to Fritz Lang's version. Tragically, some of the footage was destroyed, but they fill in the empty spaces for you."

1.0,amy_2015,Poor Amy :( Her father was a jerk. Her boyfriend was a jerk. Too bad the good folks in her life couldn't influence her more. She rose too fast and couldn't deal with the pressure of fame. Good doc showing how vulnerable Amy was and thats where her artistry and soul came from.

0.0,amy_2015,"Can't believe this received so many high ratings. The documentary makes it look like Amy was the victim in her own drug abuse and alcoholism when the choice was always hers. If I wasn't with my girlfriends family watching it, I would have shut it off after the opening credits."
1.0,amy_2015,"It only took me two hours to feel the same loving feeling for this beautiful disaster as if she were my own sister. She was a troubled soul simply yearning for paternal love; unfortunately the two people that should've given it to her (bf/dad) were the two most corrosive substances she ever ""used."""
1.0,amy_2015,"Absolutely tragic. A damaged soul being allowed, and more than not pushed, by the people who should love her the most to continue a self abusive road to basically suicide. Her parent and husband at the time should be ashamed and reap what they sowed."
1.0,amy_2015,Documentary really humanizes a truly gifted and one of a kind performer.. I hope people will think twice for making a troubled celebrity or anyone for that matter the butt of jokes and ridicule. Best music documentary in a long time if not ever

1.0,tokyo_story,"Yasujiro Ozu shows that a beautiful and powerfully emotional story can be told using only stationary camera shots, without losing any of it's effect. Brilliant."
1.0,tokyo_story,One of my most treasured films. Perfection.
1.0,tokyo_story,Yasujiro Ozu's most famous film is a masterpiece in mood and pace. The film is also infinitely successful in managing to tackle life affecting issues in such an understated and selfless way.

1.0,tokyo_story,"There's few films as patient, beautiful, and perfectly composed as 'Tokyo Story'. Its influence is still felt directly (most recently 'A Christmas Tale', and 'Yi Yi' before it), yet it still holds more power than all the imitators that have come since."
1.0,tokyo_story,One of the best dramas of all times.All current drama directors should take note.Aspiring filmmakers should also take notes on how to effectively use stationary camera.

1.0,tokyo_story,"""Isn't life disappointing?"""

1.0,tokyo_story,My favorite Ozu. One of the saddest story told on film.
1.0,tokyo_story,Beautiful. Ozu's best.
1.0,tokyo_story,"Tokyo Monogatari was a masterpiece narration. Ozu was one of the Japanese greatest film director. Unlike Akira Kurosawa who always portray the tragedy in an epic tale, Ozu prefer to crafting the poetic side of human life. Tokyo Story was superb."
1.0,tokyo_story,"Ozu's very best film, and not just because everyone says it is. It's just a sublimely photographed, written and observed family drama. The debate about whether Ozu is slow has gone on for decades - I guess some people have trouble getting into his style, but I loved this."

1.0,tokyo_story,simplicity made film.
1.0,tokyo_story,"This film sneaks up on you. What appears to be a basic family drama slowly shades in each character until the finale, which packs such an emotional wallop that you'll feel dazed & confused for days afterwards. By far the best film about family dynamics I've ever seen."

1.0,tokyo_story,It's just an amazing movie.

1.0,tokyo_story,The film that started my Ozu obsession. Classic.
1.0,tokyo_story,"Pretty depressing old school Japanese flick about kids living their lives and abandoning their parents. However, it's beautiful, sad, and absolutely wonderful. Ozu has such a unique eye and each shot is stunning."
1.0,tokyo_story,A morality play of family members representing a spectrum of filial devotion - I was amazed how I could feel and hear myself in all the characters portrayed.
1.0,tokyo_story,Ozu's comtemplative study of familial detachment is poignant and acheingly beautiful in it's simplicity and emotional resonance.
1.0,tokyo_story,amazing capture of human relationship
1.0,tokyo_story,One of Ozu's best and probably the most accsible to Western viewers. Elderly couple visit their children in Tokyo and end up being passed around by the children who don't have the time or money to waste on them. Typical Ozu formula of the disintegration of the pre-war traditional Japanese lifestyle.
1.0,tokyo_story,Ovviamente Ã¨ del 53 e non del 72. La piÃ¹ grande opera d'arte su pellicola di sempre.
1.0,tokyo_story,DEspite the little woman sittingi next to me who was crying the whole movie I think this movie is excellent. Family relationships shown in simple way leaves you thinking about the complexity of values and family in today's societies.

1.0,tokyo_story,Very touching story done by great Mr.Ozu

1.0,tokyo_story,"The original of ""Lost in translation"" at Tokyo, but also in family and in generation gap. Hara Setsuko is divinely beautiful..."

1.0,tokyo_story,"Un chef d'oeuvre, un classique, parfait pour dÃ©couvrir Ozu."
1.0,tokyo_story,This is in my top 3. It's got a subtle tone and a unique shooting style that fits the story line.
1.0,tokyo_story,Tokyo Story (and everything Ozu did) makes me feel naive... a simple story which cuts close to the hidden substance of human integrity and does more to convey the effects of circumstance in our lives than any other film i've seen - to the extent where i can't understand most of what it has to say!
1.0,tokyo_story,A slow moving movie that creeps up on you at the end. A sad story about apathy and loss of character and the difficulty of trying to survive as an empathetic person in an neglecting world.
1.0,tokyo_story,A Masterpiece. A movie which changes your life.

1.0,tokyo_story,"Any film by Ozu suits me, in fact I have four volumes of his dvd's, but this is the one that introduced me to the work of this remarkable director, and remains a firm favourite. His perceptions of human frailties and foibles are universal and absolutely spot on."
1.0,tokyo_story,"A masterpiece. The sadness and meaningless of human life and pettyness of human nature, told in an intimate and simplistic way, stylistically perfect. But why does this stupid Flixter say it's from 1972? It's from 1953."
1.0,tokyo_story,One of my absolute favorite movies and probably the best one of Ozu! A real Master piece!
1.0,tokyo_story,One of the most beautiful films ever made...Ozu at his most poignant...
1.0,tokyo_story,I cried for days... days.

1.0,tokyo_story,Wonderful film! A film that EVERYONE should go to see!
1.0,tokyo_story,"Justin Plummer,Perhaps you shouldn't be watching films of this caliber. You might hurt yourself. Not everyone lives in America, not everyone talks like you, and life isn't full of cuts. Your critique makes no sense. Don't be so ignorant of other cultures, moron."
1.0,tokyo_story,"Ozu's still camera quietly shows us the lives of a Japanese family. The subtleness of the story is reflective of the lives of most normal people, where many find themselves saying quite nonchalantly, ""Yes, life is disappointing."""

1.0,tokyo_story,"Besides Akira Kurosawa, Yasujiro Ozu is Japan's greatest contribution to film, and here's his signature masterwork. This quietly haunting film will leave you wanting so much more, it's one of the 100 best films ever."

0.0,tokyo_story,"I can see how many argue that it ""captures real life"" with its long takes and bland dialogue, but that is no excuse for it being completely uninteresting."

1.0,tokyo_story,All I have to say is this movie was beautifully directed.
1.0,tokyo_story,"A slow moving, but very delicate family drama. Ozu takes his time developing every character to the fullest extent, and it pays off with a very emotional final act. A beautiful, realistic film."

1.0,tokyo_story,"Excellent, excellent, excellent. Ozu is incredibly simplistic with the camera work and lets the story flow very lyrically. Ozu clearly deserves to be mentioned in every conversation of great Japanese filmmakers."
1.0,tokyo_story,"Slow and meditative and certainly not to all tastes, but Ozu's most famous work distills all his formal obsessions and has some wonderful central performances subtly conveying the tensions which are concealed between family members."
1.0,tokyo_story,"Slow, but deeply affecting masterpiece drama by Yasujiro Ozu. A very meditative look into the life of a family and its genderation gaps. It's Yasujiro's best film."

1.0,tokyo_story,The film that started my Ozu obsession. Classic.

1.0,tokyo_story,Slow and absolutely breathtaking
1.0,tokyo_story,"Bleak and moving, but as beautifully filmed as anything has ever been, Tokyo Story defines Ozu's static and understated approach."

1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"A masterpiece of the silent era, this is a simple story told to devastating effect, mainly by the expressions on the face of Falconetti and to a lesser extent by the expressions of all the other actors. Watch this if you want to see what kind of films The Artist payed homage to."

1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,This movie was really great! Her eyes really spoke to me and made me feel the suspense. It's amazing to think that this movie was made in the 1920s with all of the good editing and camera usage.

1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,Closeup city. Now I know where those cliches of European art films as closeup marathons come from. This is ridiculously well shot. Wonderful to look at. And that score...
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,The beauty of this movie is simply indescribable. Each close-up - which each scene is filled with - expresses the characters emotions more than anything. There is simply no need for dialoges as the characters' faces speak for themselves.

1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,One of the best performances ever filmed.
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"BEAUTIFUL black & white film! Although it's a silent film, Maria Falconetti has the ability to express and emote just with the movement of her body and her eyes. And emote she does! What a POWERFUL film!"
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"Incredibly beautiful. So avant-garde for its time, and the angles, the pacing, and the attention to detail make this a very unique experience. The ""Voices of Light"" soundtrack from the Criterion DVD is beautiful and works perfectly with the film. A great experience."
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,Avoids the frantic qualities of many silent films and delivers some of the most powerful images I have ever seen.It could not be more perfect.

1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"Quite possibly the greatest film ever made. Certainly (to my mind) the greatest filmed acting performance, evar. Falconetti, like the slide guitar player Blind Willie Johnson, here sets what must be considered an impossible standard. THIS is why art ... is."
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,The only true competition for Jodorowsky' The Holy Mountain in its evident self-declaration as the monolithic juggernaut against which all films will be inevitably dwarfed by. :P
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"Unlike other Joan of Arc movies, this one has no spectacular action scenes. There are no melodramatic or heroic scenes. And it's a silent movie. But still, this one remains the most mesmerizing version of the French martyr."
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,Hard to believe something like this could have made 80 years ago. One of the most powerful film I've ever seen.

1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"Amazing and unforgettable. It begins somewhat slow in the beginning, but the second half of the film leading up to the burning of Joan ranks it up with Battleship Potemkin. Falconetti's performance is amazing. Thank god for Criterion Collection."

1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"Watch this once-lost telling of the last days of Jeanne D'Arc, and be prepared for Maria Falconetti to burn a hole right through you with her eyes. A crusher, a stunner, watch it with your favourite whiskey by your side! Then watch it again."
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,OMG watch it silent. i saw it with this terrible soundtrack made by some proper cunt who wanted his tacky score to underline all the emotions and as a consequence he thoroughly ruined the film.Otherwise a great film with the addition of Antonin Artaud as one of the accusers.

1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"Renee Falconetti plays the condemned Joan of Arc in this early film. You don't need sound to feel this movie in your soul.

1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"This film, at the time, had a big picture budget. The producer was furious that Dreyer focused his camera on Maria Falconetti rather than on the costly period sets. If he had, this film would not have carried the intense psychological weight that it did."

1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"A true masterpiece ahead of its time in camera work, editing and acting. Got to see it with a live performance of the recently composed ""soundtrack,"" and was blown away. A miracle the film exists in this version...be sure to watch all the extras on the DVD."
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"Powerful, emotional, and very spiritual. This is probably some of the best acting I've seen, in any era, not just the silent era. The camera tilts that suggested power, and God were wonderfully executed. A must see."

1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"This movie was amazing. Falconetti never made another movie - but how could you, after making this one.

1.0,13_assassins_2011,"Fantastic movie this. Not all will get it, and some will think it's dumb, but the beauty of this film is in it's acceptance of Samurai Code. Also you can't go wrong with a half hour long showdown fight at the end ^^"
1.0,13_assassins_2011,A throw back to classic 60s Samurai films. Don't think I blinked the last 45 minutes. This film is epic.
1.0,13_assassins_2011,"13 could be lucky or unlucky [depending which side you're on]. Worth watching if only for the 45 minute epic battle sequence alone, even if Bushido ain't necessarily your thing."

1.0,13_assassins_2011,I searched along time for a copy of this. Not disappointed either a great samurai flick.
1.0,13_assassins_2011,One of the best foreign films i have ever seen
1.0,13_assassins_2011,it was like a refreshing remake of 7 samurai
1.0,13_assassins_2011,"Probably my favorite Japanese film of all time. Absolutely amazing. Brutal enough, but not over done. The story was absolutely amazing."
1.0,13_assassins_2011,"Shinzaemon Shimada: No mercy! There's no samurai code or fair play in battle! No sword? Use a stick. No stick? Use a rock. No rock? Use your fists and feet! Lose your life, but make the enemy pay."
1.0,13_assassins_2011,"Some of the craziest action sequences ever. great acting, fucked up story"
1.0,13_assassins_2011,SImply overwhelming. Breathtaking muted visuals and a heart (and gut) wrenching cast of Samurai make this extremely poetic swan song to the Shogunate era the best Samurai film since Seven Samurai. Way to go Miike.
1.0,13_assassins_2011,One of the best action and samurai movies I've seen in a long time!
1.0,13_assassins_2011,"There are several I haven't seen, but this was my second favorite movie of 2011. No nominations, though."

1.0,13_assassins_2011,"This historical action-drama, set in the years leading up to the Meiji Restoration, is dark, brutal & brilliant.If you want the kind of overly choreographed fight sequences so common in modern Asian cinema, look elsewhere. This looks real."
1.0,13_assassins_2011,"A very fine movie with a simple ""THIS guy's an asshole, THESE guys are going to kill him, LET'S SEE HOW IT GOES"" plot, linked together by samurais doing very samurai type things. I loved it."
1.0,13_assassins_2011,"Reminding myself that all samurai films appear to have the same characters and goals, ""13 Assassins"" soon made me forget that fact as it took a fresh take on the classic ""kill-the-bastard-power"" plot element and added in just the right amount of blood and gore to retain its realistic deception."
1.0,13_assassins_2011,"One of the best Samurai movies I've ever seen, and I've seen them all!"
1.0,13_assassins_2011,"This movie is a piece of perfection, an excellent story and plot laid out so beautifully rolling directly into a beautiful action film without need for extensive CGI or people flying through the air and dancing on air... simple and beautiful.

1.0,13_assassins_2011,An epic samurai equivalent to 'Unforgiven.'. Literally half the movie is an extended action sequence that works because the stakes are set up so well and the action so well-staged

1.0,13_assassins_2011,"One of the greatest Samurai movies of all time, dare I say even coming close to or even matching the greatness of ""The Seven Samurai"". Freaken loved it, you owe it to your self to seek it out and watch it."
1.0,13_assassins_2011,A traditional Shogun era Japanese film with a villain that redefines villainy.Awesome hack and slash Samurai action and fantastic story follow suit.

1.0,13_assassins_2011,It's awesome. The political context is awesome. The Samurai are awesome. The beginning is disturbing (but based on real practices of the time). Also there might be a magical Chinese God? Maybe?
1.0,13_assassins_2011,It's classic grindhouse meet the seven samurai in this great action film by Takashi Miike

1.0,13_assassins_2011,"This movie is awesome. To reiterate Sean O'Connell of the Washington post ""Does Guinness World Records have an entry for longest on-screen fight? If it doesn't, Takashi Miike's ""13 Assassins"" just set it. And if a record actually exists, Miike's film just broke it. """
1.0,13_assassins_2011,Modern day Kurosawa . I LOVED THIS FILM
1.0,13_assassins_2011,Probably one of the coolest movies I've ever seen.

1.0,13_assassins_2011,"Man, I needed a fantastic movie, and this movie definitely delivered! I haven't seen a samurai epic this great in a LOOOOOOOOOONG time. I highly recommend this to anyone, not just samurai film fans, but anyone... that doesn't hate intense violence because it is quite violent."
1.0,13_assassins_2011,"This movie is awesome. 13 men (the thirteenth is a ""Kukishiro"", for those in the know) plan to assassinate the sadistic younger brother of the Shogun."
1.0,13_assassins_2011,It is seriously the most epic samurai action movie I've seen by far. No wires or CGI was used in the sword fights. Last 30 minutes = HOLY SHIT! Takashi Miike is genius. Even the Kill Bill movies won't ever top this one.
1.0,13_assassins_2011,Bushido ethics challenged. Do you blindly serve your master or do you serve what is just? This movie is an allusion to our modern day political dilemma. Serve your party blindly or do what is best for the nation even if that means not being re-elected. I think we know the right answer!
1.0,13_assassins_2011,"Holy crap, do I want to see this! Miike at the helm of an Edo Period Piece action film? What's not to Squeee about?"

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,The plot balance is amazing. All-around very well made movie with deep meaning.
0.0,the_rules_of_the_game,I just wasn't really able to follow this. Maybe because I'm sleep deprived. But I also found it hard to care about these characters. Is the point that they're all hypocrites or tritely immoral? Okay.... plenty of people are. Why should I care?
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Talvez a mais precisa e mordaz crítica à superficialidade burguesa. Uma obra extremamente política travestida de comédia de costumes.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Incredible film. Everything was superb!
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"The brilliance of the film apparently eluded audiences at its release, but seen nowadays, it ranks among the supreme masterpieces of moviemaking."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Very Shakespearian in its tragic elements. We see this tale unravel in complete and utter chaos. It's breathtaking.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,It's overwhelming tragedy makes you crush your heart yet it grows into you oh so fondly.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Overrated. But brilliant. I just think Jean Renoir put out some better material that doesn't get the credit this one does.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A moral narrative on amorality. Enjoyed longer takes in contrast to annoying editting.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Après ce film de Renoir, le cinéma est entré dans une nouvelle ère qui - bien qu'ayant depuis connu maintes innovations et maintes évolutions - perdure encore à travers la vision géniale de Renoir."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Probably the best cinematic example of using lies to tell the truth. Simply marvelous entertainment.

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A message of substantial proportions, a class of souring sensibilities, La RÃ¨gle du Jeu is powerful, potent and smart."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Jean Renoir is the director who best explains on screen that most people are neither good or bad; but sometimes do good things and sometimes do bad things. He finds humanity in every character.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Absolutely stunning to behold. Renoir's definitive work. Manages to celebrate, condemn, and mourn pre-war french decadence."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"One of the greatest movies ever made, yo. It's like YEEEAAAAHHH MY MAN, JEAN, MAN. HE'S MY BOY. MAH BOY."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Jean renoir's masterpiece The rules of the game is the most authentic and original film of the classic cinema. his vision of the low class with the high class is superb, even when the two classes collide is fantastic, the connection between the poor and the rich and their desires and misadventures."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Not only works as a clever satire of upper class society, but as a precursor to modern affair based films. This may very well be one of the greatest of the silent films I have seen as of yet (though city lights is still my favourite). Excellent!"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"At this point, we've run out of ways to say that this is a great movie."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Terrific. Of course.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Renoir's tragicomedy set in pre-WWII France is an absolute delight. The director's use of deep focus combined with long takes allows the film to progress in a remarkably lifelike manner.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A rule-breaking, jaw-dropping fabulous comedy; a whirling, seething, absolutely scathing look at the French upper class, running pell-mell like lemmings into the sea. One of the greatest, darkest comedies ever made."

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"yes, we all have our reasons."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,One of the masterpieces cinema has to offer. The way the camera moves in this is simply amazing. You'll rarely see a movie staged as well as this.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Devastating. Part comedy of manners, part slamming door farce, all wrapped up in a shell of class warfare and their similarities. I am in pure awe of this perfect film."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"It's no insult to call the film an uncompromising, fascinatingly sophisticated echo of Hemmingway's 'The Sun Also Rises'."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,An absolutely sublime film. My 2nd favorite film of all time - following only Les Enfants du Paradis.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Jean Renoir`s satire of human manners is easily one of the most profound and multifaceted films I`ve ever seen!
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Jean Renoir's masterpiece is easily one of the first great films of the 20th Century.

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Soooooo good. Just brilliant.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"One of those movies you can watch over and over. The characters are shallow and complex, shrill and humorous, affected and vulnerable, all amounting to a tragicomic highwire act of dour resplendence."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"One of the most important films ever made, Revoir's classic stands through the weathering of time, without being rusted a bit."

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A Summer's Tale: Again I am in love with a Rohmer's character. It's not hard to guess which one, if you've seen this film. The Rules of the Game: Ah... finally I watched this. Amazing how so much is said, but what is untold carries even more depth."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,One of my all time favourites. Full review coming up.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Every frame of La regle du jeu seems dominated by Renoir's personality; yet the most appealing facets of that personality are generosity, openness, responsiveness. As a result, La regle is at once the auteur film par excellence and a work of co-operation and active participation"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Renoir's painfully brilliant comedy of manners is one of the best films of all, a masterpiece of movement, and a balancing act of character. In the words of Desson Thomson, it is life at its messiest unfolding at its most beautiful."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Renoir truly creates a masterpiece here. A biting look at high society in France at the time, this 'controversial' film is gorgeous nigh its whole length. It's vilification of society is matched in efficacy only by it's humor, which is dark and transgressive."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Often regarded as a precursor to Citizen Kane as the first modern sound film
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A very great masterpiece, 'Rules of the Game"" is to film what ""Don Giovanni"" is to opera--a perfect work of art and the completion of its genre"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Renoir's finest, as I am sure many directors would confess for copying Renoir's style. Obviously better films have been made in the same genre, just remember is was Renoir was the first to make such a film, thus the origionality is his, an no one elses."

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"For many film lovers, there's Jean Renoir, and then everybody else. Well one look at this astonishing film, and it's hard to dispute such a notion. Rules of The Game may very well be the Citizen Kane of French cinema. Check it out."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Starts slowly, but develops beautifully into a rich space."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,One of the best and memorable French b&w; movies. Satirical look on bourgeoisie is packed with walloping punches from an amazing script and excellent Renoir direction. And that ending is sadly haunting.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"So quintessentially a French cultural experience, it's almost equivalent to the first time one sees Paris at night. Cinematic perfection."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Clasico del cine frances acerca de ""los de arriba y los de abajo"" que en su epoca fue un completo fracaso de taquilla. Ahora es un trabajo absorbente, complejo, lleno de dialogos inolvidables y con una fotografia exquisita. Un trabajo inmortal."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Quite simply one of the greatest movies ever made. An intricately crafted work that never loses touch with the intimate human elements of the characters it depicts. All the more amazing since it seems to be so... effortless.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,In the same league as Citizen Kane in that any descriptions do not suffice this film's grandeur.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Cada vez que ves esta Obra maestra sacas nuevos detalles que antes te perdiste :D
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Though it is my opinion this film is over rated-it's not one of the greatest films, it still deserves a top rating. It's basically about how passions can lead people astray and make them act foolishly. The ending is somewhat shocking and justifiably legendary."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,this one hit me like a ton of bricks.
0.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"I appreciate the satire and that it was good for its time, 70 years ago, but I found it quite boring to watch. Plus they seemed to be speaking too fast!"

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Towering masterpiece from a time when film directors still respected their audience and aspired to communicate something about the human condition. This film as as life-affirming as most contemporary cinema is the opposite
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"The perfect example of a farce, with the added inclusion of a tragic ending."

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Perfect, the ultimate movie. Far too dense to absorb. Every role, every movement, every element of stage, every breath, evey word, eveything has a purpose. The equal of citizen Kane if not superior, really amazing."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Superb comedy of class, manners, behavior. Fine performances. People who like Gosford Park (and Robert Altman films in general) will get a lot out of this one."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,One of the BEST films ever made. period.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"I bought and watched this one cold, only knowing that it was ranked as the number 3 movie of all time in a census of film critics and directors. And this scathing attack of the fickle French bourgeoisie deserves to be there."

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Renoir is charming and funny. He believes in the good in humanity.I'm in love with Octave.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A great movie to revisit at any time - on the grandness and pettiness of love, friendship, and human emotions in general. Unforgettable characters. Jean Renoir is great for an actor, too, not only for a director! Can't believe it's from 1939 - beats anything I've seen from the new century..."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"It's better every time you see it, especially with all the extras in the Criterion Edition."

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Oh my yes. One of the best movies ever made. If you're reviewing this movie, then you are familiar with it and I dont have to explain that is a an amazing satire on the class system in 3rd Republic France blah blah blah"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,I remember this film. Saw it way back in College.. FAntastic. ..Now I want to see it again. Renoir--sheer genious

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"This wonderful film is lucky to still be intact after bannings by the French government and burnings of all available copies by the Nazis. That being said, the movie explores the tense relationships between lovers and friends in the pre-War French high society."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Es tan espectacular que hay que verlo para creerlo. Todo es innegablemente excelente, obra maestra de obras maestras. Sin palabras."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Fantastic movie. A must see if you have not done so yet. Picks apart the upper classes and caused a ton of controversy. A must see, I don't know how much more I can stress that."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Classic Renoir. Nuff' said.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"I know the film is about the French pre-war aristocracy, but I loved what it had to say about love, lust, and friendship, and how often they can be concealed or confused."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A great movie for those who love movies. One of the first films ever shot it depth, Rules of the Game is technically far ahead of its time. Beyond that, the characters are well developed, and the implication of montage shows the tension of pre-WWII France as the war draws nearer."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,One of the Cinema's most historically significant and most controversial works is an outstanding irreverent satire of bourgeois sensibilities from the master Renoir.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Considered one of the greatest films of all time. Jean Renoir
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Like ""Gosford Park""? See where it came from here. So much going on in this film, you could watch it ten times and see something new each viewing."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Renoir famously said 'Everybody has their reasons'. This, his most encompassing film, reconciles his obsession with deep staging and focus with his empathy and love for people caught up in their messy lives and problems. Humanist cinemas towering masterpiece."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,This really is the film you can watch over and over and over and keep seeing it as fresh as ever. At least that's how I feel after my fifth viewing. Renoir's films invite you into them - they build walls that set you free to roam within their interiors to discover layers of humanity.

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A rule-breaking, jaw-dropping fabulous comedy; a whirling, seething, absolutely scathing look at the French upper class, running pell-mell like lemmings into the sea. One of the greatest, darkest comedies ever made."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A masterpiece of understatement and half-expressed emotion, with a lot of colorful and interesting characters put through their paces in a narrative that doesn't force anything."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Great dark comedy. Highly recommended.

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,This is why I decided to be a Director
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,it feels like your peeking through the bushes watching this.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Better than Citizen Kane and was made 2 years before. Wonderfully beautiful film, use of the moving camera and different plains of action was radical and groundbreaking. Great Movie."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Tout simplement un film brillant. Peut-être plus important encore que ne l'est Citizen Kane. Les longs travellings en chassé-croisé dans le couloir de l'hotel sont des moments forts de l'histoire du cinema.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Conveys the hypocrisy and conformity in social circles perfectly. Renoir's best film, perhaps."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,One of the finest motion pictures ever made. Absolutely a masterpiece. I cannot recommend it highly enough.

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Pretentious, Moi! But it is a devastating look at pre-war French society, which confirms many prejudices. And it is made by a Frenchman, which shatters many more."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A humorous movie that pokes fun at the upper-class. One of the finest in french cinema
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Essential Renoir. It's difficult to find a director with two films bot has good as this and The Grand Illusion. Simply Great.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,It's biting and hilarious - and there is a guy in a bear suit (who doesn't love that?).
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Frankly my all-time favorite movie, nothing matches Renoir's extraordrinary direction or his script and the last image is one of the greatest and most haunting images ever put on a screen"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Vicious and biting, yet somehow still oh so funny, The Rules of the Game is one of the best social critiques on film. Renoir goes right for the throat of the oblivious upper class, and he tears their jugular right out. A classic."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Jean Renoir's 1939 masterpiece is still the most humorous film of any decade. Think of it as a caustically hilarious documentary of the discreet charm of the bourgeoisie.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A biting critique on class -- Renoir's calling card
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Two words: Jean Renoir. No one expresses the inherent bittersweet beauty of the human condition better.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Terrific. Of course.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Jean Renoir (son of the Impressionist painter, Auguste) transforms film into art with this movie. Robert Altman borrowed heavily from ""La Regle..."" for his movie ""Gosford Park"" (also fantastic). An acute observation of the upstairs/downstairs world of high society 1930s France."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Renoir is the bestest.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,This is one of the many important Renoir masterpieces. Dude was a true rebel.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,what can you say about the greatest film right before the beginning of the greatest war?
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A movie by Jean Renoir
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"The original upstairs, downstairs examination. The sheer depth of material that Renoir is able to capture in his long takes is mighty impressive. As is the dramatic but still inherently complex emotionally honest lives of the film's many characters."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Why does PT Anderson love Renoir so much? Well look at how much he takes from him (excluding There Will be Blood). The fluidity of movement and space in this film is just off the charts. Engaging to watch.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"So widely (and wisely) praised now that it's tempting to resist iconoclastically, but this is really a wonderful movie. Notice the incredible use of countryside footage - fields and grasses and grounds. This film looks like no other. It's set and filmed like no other. It's so unspeakably gorgeous."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,This film gets every character right and has to be one of the first to make full use of cinema's possibilities for using space to tell a story.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Another one of those films that is considered among the 'best of all time' that actually lives up to hype. Visually this has to be one of the most sophisticated films ever, but it is never showy or obvious."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,really holds up well to repeated viewings. i think i prefer this one to grand illusion even
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Life is like that, sometimes."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Was surprised at how bad ass this movie is. Classic? Yep. Long takes? Yep. Commentary on the class system? YEP!
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,How can I only be seeing this for the first time? Jean Renoir's story of a disastrous country house weekend in pre-WWII France is a devastating look at the folly of over-reliance on social mores. Essential viewing.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,pretty much a perfect film.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"I was surprised at how modern the characters were in this. I know that seems strange, but considering the year it was released, I didn't expect male-female relationships to be so easy (I see the irony, considering the end)."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A delightfully comic but equally scathing commentary on the hollowness of the aristocratic pre-World War II French society.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Renoir et tous les acteurs sont bons!
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Quite possibly the best film ever made. Moves with such energy and wit. The pace and intense characterization are outstanding! With each viewing, there is always something new to be absorbed. For anyone interested in classic cinema, this is a beast to be reckoned with, in the best possible way."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A ferocious social commentary. If you were to give the script to a studio in these days, there's no way they would fund a production for it."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Brilliant, layered, subtle, I have seen this 3 times and each time I discover something new. The cinematography is breath taking this film is a must!"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"One of the best movies ever made? Yeah, yeah, that's about right."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A must see - french classic - life of the privileged.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Social engagement as sexual revolution. This movie turns your adopted Puritan ideas of 'the way sex should be' on it's ear. What's more, it was made in 1939. Beat that, Closer*.*movie starring Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"One of the most beautiful films of all time, it is so consistent, the acting is superb and Renior is a genius behind the camera and the angles and positioning"

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Meilleur film francais ever ?
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,One of the all time greats!
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"I've read that a true classic grows with each reading/viewing. That is exactly why this is my favorite movie. I generally don't go in for wishing I could meet people from the past, but Jean Renoir is the exception."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"The movie where Jean Renoir explore the sequence plan and the image great gray scale to tell us a modern 1939 fable about love, jealousy and death between a noble married couple: he is a French man and she is a German woman."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Absolutely perfect in every way. I've watched it dozens of times over the course of my life and find new things to admire in it every time. If this rating system allowed ten stars, that's what I'd award it. Or thirty. Or a hundred."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Almost 80 years old and still standing the test of time. Little known film (outside of critical studies circles) and should be seen by anyone who gets a chance.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Not only a satire on the upper-class, but a full-on indictment of the facades of human nature. ""Is it a comedy, or is it a tragedy? Either way, it's a masterpiece."""
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"The grandaddy of all those rich-Europeans-gather-at-someone's-estate -for-the-weekend movies. Very funny, very tender and very tragic, this has lots to say about life, love and human folly. Should be required viewing for anyone with a heart."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"this film really stands up to all the critical praise. a wild romp through the french aristocracy circa 1939. renoir's classic is hilarious, meticulously filmed, thoughtfully scripted, and ultimately heartbreaking. this is one of the greats."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"paul schrader considers this the film without which there can possibly be no 'film canon.' i whole-heartedly concur. a brilliant, moving, hilarious and painful film, featuring great performances, great photography, and wonderful dialogue."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A Comedy From France? No. The French can't do comedy--not from the same country where Sartre was born. This is a farce-- It hurts to laugh and that was Renoir's point.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A Black and White French film? Really? But it is amazing that this film written about the different classes in French Society still is resonant today. Octave is one of my favorite characters of all time.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Brilliant, lost for words."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,holy shit freaking amazing.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Yeah, it's one of the best films ever made. There's really not much else I can say."

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Incredible movie by Renoir with a clear indigtment of the decaying morals and social uselessness of the upper classes of pre-war France. A true movie masterpiece and a stinging satire.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A Jean Renoir classic, this film truly deserves its place at the top of many film lists."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Once you get to know Jean Renoir, his films are more rewarding with each viewing. To some it may be dry, but it has such strong complexity to how everything is composed. Characters, movement, timing, conversation, cinematography, DEEP FOCUS, all utilized to gratifying extent."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,An almost perfect mess of drawing-room farce and biting social comment from master director Renoir (son of Auguste). The hunt scene has to be seen to be believed.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"absolute brilliance! a truly bold statement on class rules, and the sheer uselessness of idle people. you may not get it's greatness right away, and thats the brilliance of it. it is so subtle, that it takes a while after viewing it for the true meaning of the film to sink in. a true masterpiece"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A phenomenal film that needs to be seen several times in order to fully appreciate (or even just understand) it's reputation as one of the ""greatest"" movies ever made."

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"This is it, folks. This is the film That Which No Greater Can Exist."

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A fascinating look at the alien world of the French upper class before World War II. Essential.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Some critics have called it the greatest film of all time. It's certainly in the running. Highly influential, justifiably so."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Jean Renoir's magnum opus.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Starts off a little slow, but once it gets going its definitely a treat. Renoir's look into class is as fascinating as the characters in the film, but the real achievement of the film is the technical skills displayed- simply outstanding. 9.5/10"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Classic, influential, funny, tragic, and just perfect."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Top 5 movies of all time. The plot is a simple comedy. But the filmmaking skills on display here may never be equalled.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Renoir is one of my favorite directors. If you want to know why just see this gem of a movie that ranks amongst the best movies ever made by anyone in any country.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Renoir's virtuosic dissertation on class relations has remained as fresh as ever, influencing an entire generation of filmmakers from Altman to Godard."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,This is on my top ten favorite movies
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Robert Altman (my favorite director) once famously said ""I learned the rules of the game from The Rules of the Game."" And Altman may be the only director who's shown that he has the breadth of vision that Renoir has in his masterpiece, one of the small handful of the greatest films ever made."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"If I had 5 films to take with me to a desert island, this would be number one. It's a film that you can't reasonably begin to appreciate the first time, and each time after 10, you dicover how awe is a boundless state."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"If an alien species descended upon Earth and asked me to explain to them what is cinema, I wouldn't say a word. I would simply sit them in front of a TV set and show them two films: Citizen Kane and The Rules of the Game."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"It may not have the distinctive look of 'Citizen Kane' or the thrills of Hitchcock, but this is as perfect as films get: fluid, alternately comic and tragic, always graceful in presentation... with just a little bit of sex"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Brilliant. One of the best of all time.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A humanist masterpiece!

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,In my top 5 for sure. By far the best French film of all time by my second favorite director Jean Renoir.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"greatest film ever, period. End of discussion."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"One of the greatest of all time. The camera is a character, exploring and discovering just as much as any of the actual characters. It is funny, sad, and everything in between. It is the elegy to a society that is destined for, and meant for, extinction."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"It's the ending that makes the entire movie worthwhile for me. Good stuff overall; don't let expectations of it being ONE OF THE GREATEST MOVIES EVERRRRRR get in the way of just enjoying it, either."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Early cinematic movie, therefore it's very dramatic but in a good way because it's not too exaggerated. The cast was perfect and there is a surprise ending, but the beauty of this ending is not in of itself--it is NOT the climax of the movie.......you'll just have to watch it"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Easily the greatest movie ever made

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,All-time best Renoir? Hard to choose just one...
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Wow, one of my favorite movies. Renoir really knew how to capitalize on multiple levels of action, and really knew how to play with emotions and test our acceptances of societal conventions. If you like older movies, you definitely have to see this one."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Renoir's brilliant satire of bourgeoisie. Focusing on the lives of many characters and intertwining them perfectly during a weekend hunting trip, this film is one of the greats."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Renoir. With the craftsmanship of his father, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Jean paints a satirically delicate and critical portrait of French aristocracy. Easily outshines The Grand Illusion in my opinion."

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,By far the greatest film EVER made.

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Truly one of the classics of film. I am baffled when I heard about all of the people that disliked it upon initial release. This film is absolutely awesome. Renoir was definitely a master of his craft.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Renoir handles the politics of class, sex and (quite literally) the boundaries within and outside le chateau with such deft and artistry. Such a great work of dialogue and imagery-- a striking and potent commentary of a Europe at the edge of another World War."

0.0,district_9,"First 10 minutes promised an imaginative provocative story with clever reportage techniques and interesting photography. Sadly, it all goes downhill thereafter."
0.0,district_9,Graphics were awesome. That is it. The movie was so full of F bombs it became completely unwatchable. I watched a commentary on it and it seems the more the movie went along the less the main actor stuck to the script.
1.0,district_9,Not enough humans could be blasted to bits.
1.0,district_9,Such a great movie! The story kind of starts as a news story and I think the writer was trying to show early on that the public's perspective based on the media can be far from what's actually going on. Highly Recommend !!!

1.0,district_9,I have not seen anything so original in years. You begin by hating the main character. Then you enjoy seeing him become a victim of an infection and then you're pulling for him at the end. And did I mention this is a sci-fi with stunning graphics that takes place in South Africa.

1.0,district_9,Why can't we have prawns instead of black people.
1.0,district_9,Incredible. Honestly this movie was done in such a style that it sticks in your mind after the movie ends. Jackson combined great action with relevant plot to generate a great overall story.
1.0,district_9,"It was refreshing to see a SciFi movie that turns the genre on it's ear. The movie is fantastic in it's realism, with even the most over the top special effects believable. It is also a sad truth of how we would treat an alien species, if they happened upon out planetary doorstep. A must see film."
1.0,district_9,One of my favorite movies. Super awesome action and effects.
1.0,district_9,"Excellent, you actually feel bad for the aliens"

0.0,district_9,"I going to start banning Peter Jackson movies. First King Kong and now District 9. I think it would of have been better if it had taken place in the United States, and have the aliens not look like cockroach people who eat cat food. I give it a C- and thats being generous."
1.0,district_9,"Another masterpiece from Peter Jackson (LOTR). The story could stand alone successfully, but what really sets this movie apart from other modern sci-fi is its allegorical nature. Replace the word ""prawn"" with an oppressed group, and you have a civil rights film. Terrific film."

1.0,1213205-prophet,This is among one of the most brilliant works in modern cinema. I can't say that with enough enthusiasm. The greatest prison picture ever made.
1.0,1213205-prophet,"A masterpiece. Best film of 2009. Oscar stolen by the pretty-good, but not-as-masterful Argentinean mystery ""The Secret in Their Eyes"""
1.0,1213205-prophet,I saw this movie when it came out just after it's premiere at the Toronto Film Festival. One of the best foreign language films I've seen. Shawshank has NOTHING on this film. Everyone that has watched Shawshank MUST watch this.
1.0,1213205-prophet,"Tahar Rahim turns in an amazing performance as a young Arab man thrust into a difficult situation in a French prison controlled by the Corsican mob. He navigates his way through a boulder field of rocks and hard places in this compelling, violent drama. Highly recommended."
1.0,1213205-prophet,"A Prophet is a powerful and electrifying, but very subtle film about a teen who rises to power in the crime world throughout his years in jail. Tahar Rahim and Niels Arestrup give fantastic performances and the fact that this film lost the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film is a tragedy."
1.0,1213205-prophet,Amazing. Must make sequel.
1.0,1213205-prophet,"brilliant, powerful, and artistic"
1.0,1213205-prophet,WOW!!! This is a stunning movie. An amazing watch of a young man rising through the ranks of the Mafia through prison. BRILLIANT!!!
1.0,1213205-prophet,"Honestly one of the best prison around...if no THE best. Tahar Rahim is brilliant in this, your just wondering what he's thinking constantly when he interacts with such weird and wonderful cast. Such a good film, people need to see this."
1.0,1213205-prophet,"The best prison film ever made. It is absolutely brutal and at times will have you feeling queasy. I really hope this opens up plenty of doors for Tahar Rahim, he is a very talented actor."
0.0,1213205-prophet,Completely overrated - along with The Godfather.
1.0,1213205-prophet,Best crime drama I have seen in a long time. An intense prison thriller that is well worth 2 and a half hours of you're time.
1.0,1213205-prophet,"Expertly crafted so intricately, A Prophet is visually stunning and features a compelling and original story line supported by great performances."
1.0,1213205-prophet,a contemporary version of the godfather set in europe. it does not glorify gangsterism. This film depicts the genre in a more visceral state.
1.0,1213205-prophet,Absolutely enthralling- every minute was intriguing and I didn't want it to end. Would recommend to anyone interested in human behaviour and the personal development of a man during years of prison life
1.0,1213205-prophet,"and if i could give it more stars , i would.. everything is prefect in that movie.. it's a pure masterpiece"

0.0,1213205-prophet,Worst movie ever. Didn't bother to finish it. I barely could keep my eyes open. The movie was too slow for my taste. ZERO star for this one!
1.0,1213205-prophet,Finally got around to watching it and I really enjoyed it. Have to say French prison food looks really good.
1.0,1213205-prophet,"Like ""Bicho de Sete Cabeças"", this movie shows that the prison system is the best way to create criminals or to make them much worse then they could even imagine. As simple as that."
1.0,1213205-prophet,tout simplement incroyable
1.0,1213205-prophet,Elegant French prison thriller Scum meets Scarface.
1.0,1213205-prophet,They don't get much better than this.
1.0,1213205-prophet,"Gripping, engrossing, gritty. Well shot, acted and edited. Gives you a look at the hard life and the progressive descent into the world of organized crime by the main character but balances it with humanity. Original and thought provoking."
1.0,1213205-prophet,"superb, three things I like from France now, pain o chocolat, Eric cantona and this film :0-)"

1.0,1213205-prophet,Perfect. Perfect. Perfect.
1.0,1213205-prophet,"I always suspected that HBO's Oz tv show would have played better as a long, engrossing movie, and look here, I was essentially right."

1.0,1213205-prophet,"As many have stated, one of the best prison movies ever made."
1.0,1213205-prophet,"This was incredible. I can't believe I actually liked it more than 'The Shawshank Redemption,' as far as the prison genre goes. I think that's enough said."

1.0,1213205-prophet,"One of the all time great crime films. Not so much about crime but the human beings behind. Great mood, acting and atmosphere, realism, morality and survival, entertaining and witty. The critics are definitely right. We need MORE of this kind of intelligent cinema!"

1.0,1213205-prophet,One of the best flicks all year
1.0,1213205-prophet,"INSANE PRISON DRAMA! It gets to you slowly over its 2 hour and 30 minute runtime. Cold, grim and not always easy to watch, but its worth it."
1.0,1213205-prophet,Great movie. Really good story telling and great acting. Highly recommended. 5 star movie.
1.0,1213205-prophet,Best French Prison/Gangster film I've seen in years
1.0,1213205-prophet,Estupenda. Respeta a su público al no querer explicar lo que están viendo como en la mayoría del cine actual. De lo mejor que he visto últimamente.
1.0,1213205-prophet,"Much like all the other foreign films on this 2010 list, this movie didn't see U.S. release until this year. Anyway, I'd equate this almost to a modern day Godfather--certainly the scope isn't as epic, but the character arc is just as solid and I really loved everything about this movie."
1.0,1213205-prophet,"Best film I've seen in probably 3 years. Outstanding, do not miss this!!!!!!"
1.0,1213205-prophet,awesome. brilliant and perfect.
1.0,1213205-prophet,"It's a crime this prison flick didn't win Best Picture, let alone not win best foreign film."

1.0,1213205-prophet,"YOU HAVE TO WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!! One of the best films of the year, dont let the language turn u off (its in french), an awesome gritty hardcore movie"
1.0,1213205-prophet,"Imagine The Shawshank Redemption meets The Godfather... A little slower though, and in French, but well worth your two bucks, if you want my two cents."
1.0,1213205-prophet,Superb central performance and an absorbing take on the gangsters tale. Highly recommended.
1.0,1213205-prophet,"Well paced thriller which kept me guessing, entertained and surprised throughout."
1.0,1213205-prophet,"Esta pelÃ­cula esta en mi top 5 de dramas criminales. La vÃ­ con mi hermana en agosto y quedamos ""blown away"" por la historia y la excelente direcciÃ³n de Jacques Audiard."

1.0,1213205-prophet,Unbelievably powerful movie!!!
1.0,1213205-prophet,Fantastic. A must see.
1.0,1213205-prophet,"One of the most original and imaginative twists on the gangster genre. Unlike most American attempts at reinventing the neo-gangster film, French auteur Jacques Audiard capitalizes in all the right ways. ""A Prophet"" will stick with you long after you finish watching it."
1.0,1213205-prophet,"Yojimbo (Asian), The Man with No Name (White), Fresh (Black), El Mariachi (Hispanic): Malik (Arab) is the greatest of them all (until a Pacific Islander comes along, perhaps). Favorite prison film as well."
1.0,1213205-prophet,I wouldn't know where to start with this one - a very good movie.
1.0,1213205-prophet,"Newcomer Tahar Rahim breaks through in this tour-de-force of a movie. Audiard creates a gripping masterpice, so vibrating, complex, and thrilling, as ""Goodfellas"", that when it finishes, you're left shaken and stirred. This is a film to be applauded."
1.0,1213205-prophet,"Dark, gritty and completely believable. Audiard creates a looming feeling of despair throughout the length of the film that outweighs even the most ""happiest"" of moments, including freedom itself. See this film."
1.0,1213205-prophet,"Fucking amazing! this movie is mind blowing. It is gripping, has amazing acting, an amazing story, and is almost impossible not to be captivated by. It is THE GODFATHER in prison."
1.0,1213205-prophet,"Just watched this, mind-blowing, one of the best crime sagas, an instant classic!"
1.0,1213205-prophet,"This is simply one of the best crime/gangster movies ever made, a new classic. The film is as good as The Godfather or Goodfellas, realistic with a great story and sharp acting from the entire cast all around and violent to boot. 5 stars."
1.0,1213205-prophet,"El único ""pero"" que le encontré, es que duró demasiado... pero es una película soberbia!!!"

1.0,1213205-prophet,Best movie I've seen in a while...as good as Gomorrah.
1.0,1213205-prophet,"A crime thriller of chilling, unrelenting intensity. Matching an inscrutable protagonist to an impeccably authentic prison system is brilliance. It's been a while since a movie like this has been so savage in it's honesty and yet you can't look away. Must see."
1.0,1213205-prophet,"Good realistic plot, great acting. I love it when you can't realy say that a character is good or bad, just trying to play their hand the best way they can."
1.0,1213205-prophet,Pass the hash please.
1.0,1213205-prophet,"A Prophet is one of the most tense, gripping, and thrilling prison movies I've ever seen. A taut genre piece and a deep character study all at once, with a unique style and presentation that drips with both style and stark realism. It's a unique and masterful piece of filmmaking."
1.0,1213205-prophet,Highly Recommended...Class
1.0,1213205-prophet,"Excellent flick, the godfather meets shawshank redemption"
1.0,1213205-prophet,"Terrific, tense crime/prison thriller. Ignore any Godfather comparisons (e.g., the one on the case), and just enjoy it on it's own merits. Great acting by the lead, and brilliant screenplay."
1.0,1213205-prophet,The most satisfying account of a rise to power since Scarface.
1.0,1213205-prophet,Pode ser considerado um dos grandes filmes de crime organizado do cinema europeu.

1.0,1213205-prophet,"A gnaw-bitting, brutal prison gangster film. Not only is this one of 2010's best, but, one of my new favorites. ""Un Prophete"" re-defines the word ""EXCELLENT""."
1.0,1213205-prophet,Best movie I have seen all year!
1.0,1213205-prophet,There are some foreign films that I watch that make the majority of American films being made today look like absolute crap. This is definitely one of those films.
1.0,1213205-prophet,... one of the best movies I've seen this year ...
1.0,1213205-prophet,Excellent foreign film. Best Ive seen a while.
1.0,1213205-prophet,"A cinematic gem in every key category (acting, writing, directing, cinematography). The comparisons to the Godfather are legitimate in this troubled version of a coming of age story gone wrong. Tahar Rahim in the lead role is a star in the making. Easily one of the best films of 2010 so far."
1.0,1213205-prophet,"Bad ass movie!!! At the top of my list with scareface, godfather, ganster#1 and now A Prophet."
1.0,1213205-prophet,"Just fantastic stuff.  Just compelling, engaging and absolutely draining at times, in the best way possible."

1.0,1213205-prophet,"It was awesome! an Uneducated Arab in a french prison forced to join a Corsican mob inside the prison. It just so happens that he's good at it. Great prison drama, very realistic, plenty of backstabbing, and a very entertaining 150 minutes."

1.0,moolaade,"Every effort should be made to see Moolaadé, to see the turmoil of modern African women, and to absorb the accepting, upholding, stirring promise of filmmaking."
1.0,moolaade,"An eye-widening depiction of the unknown part of the African norm. I say, I have never been so culture-shocked by a film before."
1.0,moolaade,"A socially important film from one of the corners of the world, Moolaadé rich cultural meaning and thematics reminds us about the mental delay in big parts of the world, but Ousmane Sembene shows the values of the women and the human conception of freedom and colective thought."
1.0,moolaade,Without doubt one of the best movies I ever saw. If you ever want to see a movie about the power of Black Women then you need to see this one. Grandmaster director Sembene could have taught some American directors a thing or two. If you ever get the chance see this movie.
1.0,moolaade,A powerful attempt to expose misconceptions towards religion that have been speciously accepted as traditional norms for generations. Audacious and unforgettable.
1.0,moolaade,Poderoso film hecho con 20 lucas.
1.0,moolaade,"I've been waiting to watch this movie for a long time, and it didn't disappoint. I wasn't prepared for how beautifully shot it was. I don't know if it had ""actor"" actors or not, but whether or not they were trained they were all great here. And, of course, I love the political message."
1.0,moolaade,"I found this to be both a disturbing look into the lives of women facing struggles of African tradition and an uplifting tale about their resistance. Overall, Moolaade is a powerful and intelligently written film from Ousmane Sembene."
1.0,moolaade,É lindo. É forte. É denso. Vejam já!

1.0,moolaade,another awesome foreign film set in Burkina Faso around the horrible practice of FGM
1.0,moolaade,"Art as a catalyst for change...the story is gripping, the characterizations are memorable, and the subject matter resonates. It's a film about different manifestations of COURAGE."
1.0,moolaade,A masterpiece. Semebene manages to balance the heavy-handed subject matter and poignency of the story. I enjoyed the film on an emotional and intellectual level.
1.0,moolaade,way to go women! that is a fucking revolution done right!
1.0,moolaade,Shame sembene won't be making any more films.
1.0,moolaade,Tough and beautiful movie about the harsh and complex reality of female genital mutilation. Strongly recommend it to gain a better awareness of FGM in subsharan africa.
1.0,moolaade,"Very powerful story!!....About the whole purification process, My legs get crossed automatically whenever I think about it."
1.0,moolaade,"A very special movie about brave women who stand up against this horrible tradition. EVERYBODY should see it, and take a stand, and do something to make this tradition disappear from our lives. Education is the key, and this movie is doing it."

1.0,moolaade,RIP Sembene. Such a sad loss.
1.0,moolaade,"One of the most beautiful, beautifully made films I've seen."
1.0,moolaade,"Wonderful film. The story centers around a woman who shelters several girls seeking sanctuary from getting circumcized in a Birkina Faso village.

0.0,elle_2016,"1st 15 mins or so you think wow this is going to be a confronting movie and from then on it just turns into laughable dribble, the end scene in the cemetery just highlights that the Director through everything at it to make this very painful/boring movie more absurd and cringe worthy."
0.0,elle_2016,This movie was Terrible. Ridiculous situations and pathetic attempt to be suspenseful. I couldn't wait for it to be over. We guessed who the attacker was in the first 15 minutes. From there it was just watching the heroine's bizarre and uninteresting behavior.
0.0,elle_2016,Terrible movie...terrible writing
1.0,elle_2016,"Finally, Paul Verhoeven has made the movie he was born to make. In the 1980's and 90's he was trying to communicate large themes in films that were very much of the time. Now, he brings his biting humor to material that could have played like another rip-off by Tarantino."

Although it has star appeal, the writing is abyssmal, the music boring and repetitive, the dance numbers uninspired, and the storyline formulaic.

1.0,seventh_seal,This movie needs no review. A masterpiece.
1.0,seventh_seal,"The Seventh Seal, a film of grim and haunting thoughts on death, pain, and agony"
1.0,seventh_seal,"The harder you try to wrap your head around it, the less you'll truly appreciate it. It's best to watch ""The Seventh Seal"" for what it is: a cerebral and existential portrait of crusade-era Sweden that stands as a solemn reminder that death comes for us all."
1.0,seventh_seal,"Philosophical, compelling, wildly fascinating."
1.0,seventh_seal,"Bergman's masterpiece set in medieval Sweden, with mind-blowing visuals and heavy theme of death."
1.0,seventh_seal,"A classic and masterpiece in its own right, The Seventh Seal is a profound examination from Ingmar Bergman about a quest we all can relate to. A challenge that not all will like to take, but for those willing to, it will be rewarding all its 96 minutes."
1.0,seventh_seal,"Tackling universal themes with an intelligence rarely seen since, The Seventh Seal is a landmark in cinema and one of Bergman's finest and most influential works."
1.0,seventh_seal,"One of very, very, few old pretentious classics that I really liked. Has a lot to say, and it says it well."
1.0,seventh_seal,"The Seventh Seal is a singular and macabre story, filled with symbolisms and striking visuals that brought the talent of Ingmar Brgman to the screens."
1.0,seventh_seal,"A knight ponders the meaning of death in a land gripped by the plague. Be wary playing chess with a pale fella dressed in black, there is plently of comedy to offset the heavy themes. The film contains some of the most iconic shots in all of Cinema and the Criterion collection release looks great."
0.0,seventh_seal,I was too impatient to sit through it and too disinterested to know what it was about. That was some weird shit right there.
1.0,seventh_seal,"Haunting, whip smart and totally enthralling - this visual, metaphysical odyssey is wholly original and a must see for film lovers."
1.0,seventh_seal,"Death is a cloaked man who knows how to play chess. The more you know, kids. This is Ingmar Bergman's masterpiece. One of the world's finest tragicomedies."

1.0,seventh_seal,Hypnotic. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. It's a beautifully shot film.
1.0,seventh_seal,A towering pinnacle of horror in the face of death. A death that can talk and play chess with you.
1.0,seventh_seal,"The peak of Bergman's cinematic brilliance, The Seventh Seal is the epitome of brilliant and calculated filmmaking with every reel inspiring deep inquiry and reflection traced behind by a rising and falling atmosphere from hope to looming drear."
1.0,seventh_seal,"one of the most brilliant dark fantasy film from a genius director. Ingenious, brooding, morally sophisticated and powerful enough to move someone out of their seat not to piss but by this time, to contemplate... incredible"
1.0,seventh_seal,"With an intro from the book of relevation, Bergman summits his tale of ""dance of the dead"". Imagery so alive and breathtaking, filled with core-deep faith philosophy. A journey towards the jugdement day, filled with horror, humor and irony. One of the very best films ever made."
1.0,seventh_seal,A true masterpiece. The opening scene with the chess game has become a well deserved classic.

1.0,seventh_seal,My favorite film of all time. Bergman's masterpiece.

1.0,seventh_seal,"Truthfully, I don't really understand the metaphor and message in The Seventh Seal. But The Seventh Seal is a stunning and beautiful masterpiece which will bring you a philosophical journey."
1.0,seventh_seal,"A Masterful take on the 14th century in sweden about religion and hope in a world full of dispair. Very spiritual and aknowledge some social problems wich we face in everyday life, but in another time period."

1.0,seventh_seal,Way ahead of its time...really draws you in...
1.0,seventh_seal,"Bergman's best, and an excellent pictorial explanation of Christian vs atheistic existentialism. Max von Sydow and Gunnar Bjornstrad are outstanding and the black and white cinematography breathtaking. A movie you can never forget. The score for this one should be 100%."

1.0,seventh_seal,"No foreign film has been so ingrained into popular culture, and though it's sad that it can't help but overshadow Ingmar Bergman's other masterpieces, Seventh Seal earns its spot."
1.0,seventh_seal,"A thought-provoking, character-driven drama on the purpose--and futility--of life."
1.0,seventh_seal,"The seventh seal may very well be Bergman's most prolific work of his career, which is saying quite a lot . It helped to launch his career as a notable and respected director of foreign films. His mezmerizing classic has transcended time with a message that still feels relevant even today."

1.0,seventh_seal,"Ingmar Bergman's grim masterpiece fluently esteems good and evil with minimalism and assurance - it is a profound creation that echoes such wisdom as the Bible, as Shakespeare, as philosophy to produce its own theatrical language."
1.0,seventh_seal,"A profound spiritual film by one of the masters, one of my favorite films of all-time."
1.0,seventh_seal,"The final scene of everyone, hand-in-hand, dancing off into the distance, has stuck with me since. It's powerful."

1.0,seventh_seal,I need to watch it again because I was in a trance during first viewing.
1.0,seventh_seal,A classic and a film not well known but the images of death have been immortalized.

1.0,seventh_seal,"Thought provoking and raises several relevant questions. The filming, acting and the symbolism make this a great work of art as well as an enjoyable movie."
1.0,seventh_seal,An undeniable classic. Those who don't like it should just lose a game of chess against Death.
1.0,seventh_seal,"The bar was raised by Bergman when he made the seventh seal, and very few directors have been able to come close."
1.0,seventh_seal,"""The Seventh Seal"" explores a topic used in movies so many times that today it would seem dated. That topic is facing death and not knowing how to react. Everyone has done it. But even if ""Seal"" was released tomorrow, it would still be as fresh, beautiful and perfect as it was in 1957."
1.0,seventh_seal,Max von Sydow is so stupid doesn't he realize he IS God?
1.0,seventh_seal,What could be more difficult than trying to keep your cool as you await death to make is movie in chess that will determine if you live or die.
1.0,seventh_seal,"Outstanding film about life and death and the thin veil that separates them, using Medieval symbolism with great efficiency. It's like a moving Albrect Dürer."
1.0,seventh_seal,One of the *classics*! I love Bergman films!

1.0,seventh_seal,"How is it possible that this film doesn't have a 100%? This film is probably Bergman's biggest achievement. I personally like Wild Strawberries better, but this is a movie that you will have to end up watching if you want to be even the slightest bit efficient on movies."
1.0,seventh_seal,"Though it has dated a little (okay a lot), this is still one of the most challenging and thought-provoking films of the 50s (and provocative if you are a believer)."

1.0,seventh_seal,"A knight returning from the Crusades plays chess with Death in a countryside stricken with the plague. Great gloomy masterpiece that bludgeons you on the head with the message ""you're going to die... no one can save you... and it's going to be HORRIBLE."""
1.0,seventh_seal,"What's to say that hasn't already been said about this one? It's a beautiful observation on God, faith, and life, executed stunningly by Bergman. While I prefer The Virgin Spring (of Bergman's work that I've seen, which isn't nearly enough), this is as good as cinema gets."
1.0,seventh_seal,Amazing film. Great movie about how to deal with death. this film is up high on my list of favorite foreign films.
1.0,seventh_seal,"Having finally seen it, I can say I was surprised by the amount of humour as well as the nuance to Bergman's typically spiritual subtext. Other than that, the stunning scenery, chilling score and cinematography, and... oh, you know, it's a masterpiece. Sheesh."
0.0,seventh_seal,"I didn't like it. At all. I usually like films dealing with themes like this. I usually like a little twisted and surreal films, but I didn't like this very much at all."
1.0,seventh_seal,Death always wins. Death is always around the corner. The answers only come from Death. The sanest characters in this film are indifferent of God's existence entirely. A legendary masterpiece.

1.0,seventh_seal,"Visually striking, sombre but also often (darkly) funny tale of life, plague and death ravaging Sweden in medieval times. Iconic chess scene with Knight Von Sydow and Death is not to be missed."

1.0,seventh_seal,Easily one of the greatest films of all time.

1.0,seventh_seal,An apocalyptic feel permeates the entire film; this film is also one of the most well-balanced films I have ever seen: nearly every scene is shadowed by another scene of an opposite emotion.

1.0,seventh_seal,"Thought-provoking movie full of metaphors about life and death, light and dark, good and evil, and heaven and hell. A complete work of art that allows for individual interpretations of the questions it asks."
1.0,seventh_seal,A ton of Bergman's dialogue is deceptively straightforward. It was fun listening to my inner optimist and fatalist on opposite shoulders come to quite different conclusions about the Knight's search for purpose in an unforgiving universe.
1.0,seventh_seal,"Un cavaliere incontra la morte, ma prima di soddisfarla vuole trovare Dio e il senso della vita, cosÃ¬ prende tempo sfidandola a scacchi.

1.0,seventh_seal,"Bleak, shadowy cinematography combined with the menacing presence of Death at every corner, life filled with half-hallucinations of divinity and the common madness of mankind, it's Bergman at his finest."

1.0,seventh_seal,"Swedish knight returns home to plague ravaged country. This iconic Bergman movie, apparently panned in Sweden for its theatrical acting, is one of the great foreign movie classics for the subtitle crowd."

1.0,seventh_seal,"Nothing like what I expected from this film, but it still blew me away. I want to watch it again just because I think more of it would sink in. Bergman made an extremely deep film, but what would you expect from a film that has ""Death"" as a character?"

1.0,seventh_seal,"Misanthropic, bleak, grim, and yet hauntingly beautiful and majestic, The Seventh Seal is a masterpiece of film."
1.0,seventh_seal,A must see for anyone considering general religious studies or the evolving history of film. Was revolutionary in it's time for asking hard questions aloud. An artistic masterpiece.

1.0,seventh_seal,"Ingmar Bergman's breakthrough art film. One of the best movies ever made. Both dark and beautiful, manages some powerful images... My favorite - Max Von Sydow playing chess with death."
1.0,seventh_seal,This movie was abso-incredible!
1.0,seventh_seal,"A very somber and melancholy film all the way throughout (although it does take place during the Middle Ages while the black plague is sweeping Europe). Bergman always uses some sort of self or primal doubts in his films, but I think this is the most successful at conveying that. Masterpiece."
1.0,seventh_seal,No other movie has spiritually moved me as much as this one.
1.0,seventh_seal,"So much as been said and written about The Seventh Seal already that I would be unlikely to add anything particularly eloquent or insightful to those comments. Suffice to say that this is a must-see film. Also, the Blu-Ray presentation by Criterion is absolutely stunning - top notch."
1.0,seventh_seal,Another film that everyone should watch. Many times while I was recording this movie has saved my computer.
1.0,seventh_seal,This Bergman classic is a new favorite of mine. I especially enjoyed the knight's confession scene. Highly recommended.

1.0,seventh_seal,"A knight comes home from fighting in the Crusades during the period of the Black Plague and begins to question his faith in God and his actions; engaging in a game of chess with the Grim Reaper himself.

1.0,seventh_seal,"el juego entre la vida ya la muerte es sencillo de entender, si lo juegas."
1.0,seventh_seal,"A knight and death face each other in a game of chess, but is is much more then that. This is basically about the fear we have with death. I love this movie for many reasons, but watching the knight overcome the fear of death. This movie is not for everyone, but is should be!"

1.0,seventh_seal,The first and best Ingmar Bergman film I've seen. A knight from the crusades challenges Death to a game of chess for his life when approached and told that it is his time to die.
1.0,seventh_seal,"Beautiful, thought provoking, and pretty much perfect. Max Von Sydow plays Chess with Death so he can find his purpose in life before his inevitable death. Funny in places, very direct in its questioning of God's existence and the exploitation of the weak by organised religion."
1.0,seventh_seal,"Bergman's trademark crisis-of-faith seen as a medieval morality play. A stunning and sometimes playful use of genre to work on philosophy, and truly deserving of its status as ""one of the best films ever made""."

1.0,ran,RAN is a miraculous film made by one of the best filmmakers of all time. How someone in their 70's could make such an epic take on King Lear is beyond me. It is perhaps Kurosawa's last great film in the Japanese period drama genre- a genre of films he had no equals in.

1.0,ran,A flawless retelling of Shakespeare King Lear
1.0,ran,"Mr. Kurosawa is a master of merging the epic scale with the meticulous details, the majestic backdrops with the puny humans within it. With Ran, the result is a must-see for lovers of battle films, period films, or cinema as a whole."
1.0,ran,"An epic film with some of the most greatest battle scenes, characters, and visual shots. It's a superb film adaptation of Shakespeare's King Lear."
1.0,ran,Just another reason Kurosawa continues to reign as my favorite director. So few people can make films this epic and this intimate. Plus it has one of the best uses of color in film history.

1.0,ran,EPIC and just plain beautiful to watch!! I love Akira Kurosawa!!
1.0,ran,I thought it was just another prodigal son story. I was wrong. Epic movie is epic!
1.0,ran,What an epic battle. This film is so good. Kurosawa is the master of Japanese film.
1.0,ran,"Kurosawa's greatest film, and my personal favorite when I was in high school and liked PRETTY COLORS AND BLOOD."
1.0,ran,"It has been said before, but I would like to reiterate: if Shakespeare made films chances are they would look like Ran. Kurosawa proves that he could still direct films well into his eighties and still obilterate the competition."
1.0,ran,What a drag it is getting old.
1.0,ran,First time I saw it I wasn't crazy about it. I just watched it again and loved it. One of the most intense movies I've seen in a long time.
1.0,ran,A spectacular battle epic
1.0,ran,This is why Kurosawa is one of cinema's greats.
1.0,ran,One of the best war movies ever made.
1.0,ran,potentially the most stunningly brilliant movie ever made.
1.0,ran,"Wow, what a movie. I love Japan, it's culture and Japanese. This is a great movie from Japan's best directors Kurosawa. I also love the fact it's an historical movie."
1.0,ran,"""For aficionados of the war movie, the western, and the period action epic, Ran is necessary viewing."" Amy Taublin"
1.0,ran,One of Kurosawa's best
1.0,ran,Akira Kurosawa directed Ran with the same insatiable bloodlust comparable to that of Lord Hidertora's raging sons.
1.0,ran,"Best movie I have seen recently, dark, intense, philosophical, good story and good visual."
1.0,ran,"Kurosawa's interpretation of Shakespeare's King Lear through the prism of Imperial Japan, is one of the great masterpieces of world cinema..."
1.0,ran,"Superb inspiration of King Lear at the hands of a true filmmaking genius. Akira Kurosawa, you deserve a bow. Tragic epic told with as less cheesiness as possible."
1.0,ran,five stars just for the scenery
1.0,ran,Again..Akira Kurosawa...perfect
1.0,ran,"Akira Kurosawa adapts King Lear into a Japanese feudal era piece flawlessly. The Cinematography, and scale of the production design alone solidify the film as a cinematic landmark. Ran will mesmerize it's audience not only as an epic war film, but also as a ironic and engrossing morality play."
1.0,ran,One of the best Shakespeare adaptations ever!!
1.0,ran,"A classic of Japanese cinema. If you haven't watched it, do yourself a favor."
1.0,ran,"Classic epic from every level. Cinematography, music score, costume design, clever performaces, and the battle scenes. The director's re-done ideas of King Lear is as great as you expect. Slow-paced, picking up after the first hour, and then came the heartbreaking ending."
1.0,ran,One of the most epic films I've ever scene. This may currently be my favorite film!
1.0,ran,Terrific film. Possibly Kurosawa's finest film.
1.0,ran,There's nothing I have to say that hasn't been said by the consensus.
1.0,ran,"Kurosawa's interpretation of Shakespeare's King Lear through the prism of Imperial Japan, is one of the great masterpieces of world cinema..."
1.0,ran,This movie is a work of art.
1.0,ran,This movie has some of the best acting in japanese film i've ever seen. Its great i love the beginning when the father gets pissed off at his youngest son
1.0,ran,"Watching an old evil lose its head and find redemption and meaning in the most unlikely of sources, what a watch this is."
1.0,ran,This movie is going to ruin my whole day... but it was excellent
1.0,ran,Kurosawa`s last great movie!
1.0,ran,"By far the best film of Asian cinema! Being new to Akira Kurosawa, i'd love to see more of his films!"
1.0,ran,Love Akira Kurosawa movies..
1.0,ran,"One of the most beautifully filmed films, ever."
1.0,ran,"King Lear in fudeal Japan? What more could anyone need? Not much, I'd say. Kurosawa manages to find a sombre beauty in tragedy and existential crisis. This film is nothing short of astounding."
1.0,ran,"Both grand and intimate. This movie is a colorful, emotional epic that ranks up there with Seven Samurai."
1.0,ran,epic film I loved the colors
1.0,ran,"A nation is a beating heart. And it can be torn asunder.I now realize several dictators have never read Shakespeare or seen Kurosawa's films, explains ALOT.""Those who fail to learn from the past..."""
1.0,ran,Kurosawa's greatest achievement...a pure masterpiece
1.0,ran,amazingly well made epic.
1.0,ran,The best Kurosawa I saw so far! No character is shallow and most of them could have a movie on their own.
1.0,ran,One of the most compelling movies i've ever seen. Excellent in every possible way.
1.0,ran,"It took me 26 years to watch it, to my shame. Kurosawa's epic masterpiece - based on King Lear - is a monument in its own right. A stylishly designed, dark-hearted lesson in the tragical realism that the human condition so often descends into."
1.0,ran,One of Kurosawa's greatest achievements.
1.0,ran,King Lear with Samurais...
1.0,ran,"""Only the birds and the beasts live in solitude."""
1.0,ran,"The massive scale, amount of planning, direction, and coordination that went into this film makes epics like Lord of the Rings look fat and lazy."
1.0,ran,"Kurosawa's ostentatious Shakespearean masterpiece wields vibrant colors, a visceral musical score, extravagant set pieces, and overwhelming epic battles. Despite that, it seemed Kurosawa butchered Shakespeare's play. 98/100"
1.0,ran,Nothing short of an epic and one of Kurosawa's last great work and nothing short of it. I liked just about everything and thats what makes it amazing.
1.0,ran,again I got a VHS copy of this before but now where can I find a copy?
1.0,ran,very long and just beautiful. no words can describe this large scale epic. this is Kurosawa's last great work.
1.0,ran,Het grandiose epos van Akira Kurosawa dat 'King Lear' vertaalt naar het 16de eeuwse Japan. Een meesterwerk en klassieker die je als zelfrespecterende filmfan moet gezien hebben!
1.0,ran,"Sprawling, ambitious, and beautifully shot, Akira Kurosawa's Ran is a marvelous film that showcases Kurosawa's skill for complementing narrative with visuals. The last shot of the film is incredible."
1.0,ran,Kurosawa strikes again with another hari-kari filled samurai flick shot in colour! Superb.
1.0,ran,Kenneth Branaugh eat your heart out. Now THIS is how you adapt Shakespeare
1.0,ran,One of the finest films ever made.
1.0,ran,"For Kurosawa to turn in such a stunning achievement while in his 80s and struggling to find funding and a market in his own country is quite a feat. Kurosawa made plenty of pictures with personality, but none moreso than Ran."
1.0,ran,"A fitting ""end"" to a great director's career that is a classic in of its self."
1.0,ran,"Ran proves that even near the end of his life, Akira Kurosawa will always be one of the greatest directors who ever lived."
1.0,ran,"The thing with Akira Kurosawa's films is to me he's flawless. This is scientific proof of that considering he was over 70 when he made this tale of karma. Lord Hidertora Ichimonji is ruthless, cold, and sadistic. Watch it yourself. Take my word."
1.0,ran,"flexor!!! from rashorom to ran, akira kurosawa never let us disapointed! akira forver!"
1.0,ran,"So fuckin cool. Excellent cinematography, excellent story."
1.0,ran,"in a mad world, only the mad are sane!"
1.0,ran,Kurosawa three of top-ten! Japanese version of King Lear...
0.0,ran,Overrated. Dont know how its in IMDB top 250
1.0,ran,"Epic, beautifully stylish, tragic and disciplined."
1.0,ran,Watching Ran on the big screen is a movie-going experience akin to seeing Lawrence of Arabia in 70 MM. A beautiful and tragic movie.
1.0,ran,"Maybe the best cinematic treatment of Shakespeare (along with Branaugh's HAMLET), with dazzling cinematography and some of the greatest battle sequences ever filmed. Must viewing for anyone not afraid of subtitles."
1.0,ran,This is an exquisite piece of cinema. Shakespeare and Kurosawa make an unbeatable team. See this movie.
1.0,ran,I just saw this at the Belcourt Theater in Nashville and it was AMAZING!
1.0,ran,"another great Kurosawa film, another vision of a great shakesphere play told through his point of view. Like ""Throne of Blood"", Ran is a film that takes Shakesphere vision, translated them into Japanese history, but manges to keep the universal themes."
1.0,ran,Best tragic film ever. More analysis later.
1.0,ran,One of Kurosawa's best
1.0,ran,Kurosawa = Stunning achievement in epic cinema. and in Color!
1.0,ran,"Mieko Harada is creppy and evil as Lady Kaede. The sweep of the ""King Lear"" story is ever sprialling downward. The visuals are striking and gruesome and beautiful. A wonderful film."
1.0,ran,A masterpiece. Epic battles with thousands of extras makes them even more spectacular. Just perfection.
1.0,ran,A Giant Samurai Epic based on Shakespeare's King Lear with great Battles and Natur Shots grandious directed by the Master Akira Kurosawa a tragic Masterpiece about Trust and Mistrust
1.0,ran,Gorgeous masterpiece.
1.0,ran,"This is a masterful and almost perfect visualision and dramatisation of a story thay anyone has ever commited to a film reel, in my opinion. Kurosawa, the master of cinema."
1.0,ran,"Ran is slightly marred by some too obvious straining toward masterpiece status, yet it's a stunning achievement in epic cinema. Working on a large scale seems to bring out the best in Kurosawa's essentially formal talents."
1.0,ran,"One of the, if not the, best film ever!"
1.0,ran,One of the greatest films ever
1.0,ran,"A Tragedy stained with blood, soaked in Cinema"
1.0,ran,saw this years ago as an undergrad. it was incredible! would live to watch it again
1.0,ran,just... amazing. Kurosawa is definitely the greatest of all time.
1.0,ran,Akira Kurosawa's last epic is every bit as brilliant as his early epics.
1.0,ran,"For what can be considered to be Akira Kurosawa's final epic, I honestly can't think of a better way to go out. Visually awe-inspiring. I haven't seen a movie that looks this great in years. As far as I'm concerned, this movie is as close to feudal Japan as modern man can get."
1.0,ran,"A true tragedy, to be sure, but one that always manages to get me in a tremendously deep way. By far my favorite film of Kurosawa's."
1.0,ran,This may well be the best epic film ever made. It's certainly amongst the best I have ever seen.
1.0,ran,"Beautifully filmed and the battle scenes are stunning. Movies like this (Braveheart, Kingdom of Heaven, Troy) are either great or bad in my opinion. Kurosawa never made a bad war film, or a bad film at all really. Check it out if you don't mind subtitles and long takes."
1.0,ran,Perhaps the best Shakespearian adaptation of all time by the cinematic master Akira Kurosawa.
1.0,ran,"I know this has become a cliche saying among movie critics and others. But its so true, nobody could shoot a battle scene like Akira Kurosawa did."
1.0,ran,"Shichinin no Samurai this, Seven Samurai that, and blablabla, yes ppl may say Shichinin no Samurai aka Seven Samurai is Kurosawa's best effort, but this is without doubt my favorite from him ! (and just fyi, i love Seven Samurai, gave it 4 1/2 stars and also in my top 100)"
1.0,ran,A true masterpiece by Kurosawa. The battle sequences were made to look like a ballet on a Sunday night. Truly profound and beautiful.
1.0,ran,"The first movie to have made me cry.I don't cry often.Not when my dog died, not when grandparents pass.This made me cry."
1.0,ran,excellent movie. good job akira
1.0,ran,Kurosawa is infallible. Great take on King Lear. Awesome use of color and scenery.
1.0,ran,Fantastic Epic. The most beautiful opening landscape scenes!
1.0,ran,"One of many Kurosawa movies that is absolutely riddled with amazing costumes and Characters. ""I am lost."" - ""Such is the human condition."""
1.0,ran,"A fantastic adaptation of ""King Lear."" Epic in proportion and brilliantly acted."
1.0,ran,"""Man is born crying. When he has cried enough, he dies."""
1.0,ran,A pure masterpiece. It takes a overdone genre ?samurai films? and pushes the limits. Using Shakespeare as a foundation and building the story into an epic tale of betrayal. This movie has inspired so many filmmakers it should never be ignored.
1.0,ran,Totally breathtaking!
1.0,ran,"Overwhelming and magnificent visual style, resonant and poetic, dynamic, painterly composition and striking, expressionistic color. Mieko Harada is flawlessly ruthless as the vengeful Lady Kaede. The last and greatest masterwork by Akira Kurosawa."
1.0,ran,"Quand Kurosawa se met à la couleur, ça donne un tableau à chaque plan. Un chef-d'oeuvre digne des plus grandes tragédies grecques."
1.0,ran,King Lear in Japan. My favorite Kurosawa and the best King Lear adaptation I have seen. The absence of sound in the battle sequences is haunting.
1.0,ran,A masterpiece by Kurosawa. Easily one of the greatest film adaptations of Shakespeare in history.
1.0,ran,"Very dark existentialist film, one that I identify with very much. Some of the best war scenes ever filmed. Cinematic perfection."
1.0,ran,"The brilliant Japanese director Akira Kurosawa's take on William Shakespeare's KING LEAR is nothing short of stunning. Unforgettable imagery and characters abound in this beautiful work of art. The first viewing may be a bit difficult, but repeat viewings are a joy."
1.0,ran,"I'm pretty sure that this was Kirosawa's first film in technicolor, and it has that stunning colorful beauty of early technicolor films. The acting is great, and the direction is ahead of its time, as with most of Kirosawa's movies."
1.0,ran,"I absolutely love this movie. The first time I rented it from Netflix, I actually watched it twice the same night! Heart-wrenching but wonderful!"
1.0,ran,"I love how colors. Nice, but violent."
1.0,ran,"Undesputably the best battlefield movie merging grand picturesque, Japanese culture, powerful drama and cross reference with Shakespeare's ""King Lear"" by artistic shoting and mastery in directing. Hats off to Akira Kurosawa!"
1.0,ran,The Japanese version of King Lear done many times better. I love that time and moments are savoured in this film. The gorgeous cinematography is really a treat.
1.0,ran,Breathtakingly brilliant.
1.0,ran,Best Movie based on Shakespeare ever totally stunning
1.0,ran,"High tragedy on an epic scale. Gorgeous, lush cinematography. (Those beautiful grassy hills!)"
1.0,ran,Brillant. Tout simplement.
1.0,ran,Extraordinary. Excellent acting. Extremely moving and 3 hours doesn't seem long enough. Mmm.
1.0,ran,Oustanding transfer of King Lear to a samurai epic; interesting choice of long shot photography by Kurosawa.
1.0,ran,"This is by far the best Shakespeare adaptation ever shot on film, and maybe even the best film ever made -- but this is only my humble opinion, of course."
1.0,ran,man crave epic movie. it just can get as epic as this story of shogun who earned everything and lost it all at his final days to a woman full of scorn.
1.0,ran,One of the greatest movies ever made. Possibly Tatsuya Nakadai's greatest role.
1.0,ran,Simply one of the best.
1.0,ran,rarely watch something more beautifull and powerfull on a silver screen
1.0,ran,A true spectacle of cinema. If you can find the time watch it.
1.0,ran,Another bloody film that I surprsingly enjoyed. Hail to Akira Kurosawa.
1.0,ran,Kurasawa's King Lear -- and his masterpiece.
1.0,ran,Kurosawas best movie and probably one of the best movies ever made.
1.0,ran,"""Ran"" must surely be Kurosawa's masterpiece. Mieko Harada is extraordinary,and the settings are simply stunning."
1.0,ran,Excelente filme que la nueva generación no logra apreciar. Ja.
1.0,ran,"Incredible. Costumes, cinematography, direction are all just unbelievable. It makes we wonder what Seven Samurai and other epic Kurosawa would look like in color."
1.0,ran,As near perfect as a film can get.
1.0,ran,"The oldest hath borne most: we that are young,Shall never see so much, nor live so long."
1.0,ran,"I had been meaning to see this for a long time. I thouroughly enjoyed it, it is not as some people think a direct adaptation of King Lear. Yet again another excellent Kurosawa film."
1.0,ran,One of Kurosawa's best in a long career of brilliant films.
1.0,ran,epic. beautiful film by Kirosawa. they don't make films like this anymore.
1.0,ran,one of his best movies!!!
1.0,ran,Superb! Akira Kurosawa didn't fail us. Ran is a breathtaking masterpiece which everyone should watch.
1.0,ran,Kurosawa's last epic is probably the most beautiful of all is films. His direction is impeccable.
1.0,ran,"This movie is a pure EPIC. The scope: EPICThe acting: EPICThe setting: EPICThe story: EPICKurosawa pulled out all the stops for this one, and does not disappoint."
1.0,ran,Kurosawa's portrayal of insanity is one of the bests in cinema.
1.0,ran,What can I say? This man has not made a bad movie (at least with the ones that I have seen). But the story is absolutely amazing and fucked up as well but it is just an amazing piece of cinema. This is a must see. Very well done.
1.0,ran,One of my favourite movies of all times.
1.0,ran,"Based on King Lear, an artistic masterpiece. Kurosawa's best."
1.0,ran,"Wow, wow, and wow. 2 hours and 40 minutes flew by. Great movie all around."
1.0,ran,"Wonderful film. (I should note that it was not released in 2000, but in 1985.)"
1.0,ran,Let's put it this way. Shakespeare was history's greatest playwright. Lear was his greatest play. Kurosawa improved upon it. Nuff said.
1.0,ran,Makes everything else look cheap.
1.0,ran,one hell of a bleak picture. so intense and beautiful (in a very ugly way)one of kurosawa's best.
1.0,ran,YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSH
1.0,ran,"It's fucking Kurosawa, how can it NOT be good?"
1.0,ran,It could only be better if they added ninjas.
1.0,ran,Great adaptation of King Lear.
1.0,ran,Quite simply a masterpiece!
1.0,ran,The performance of actors were very good and the score was excellent. The cinematography was marvelous and the way Kurosawa brought out the colors was just in a genius way. This film is a color masterpiece by Kurosawa.
1.0,ran,Kurosawa is genious.
1.0,ran,"scenery, score, everything was absolutely amazing. it seemed real, until the hyper real blood took hold of the scene. but ti was strong on the connection and emotional portrayal of the characters."
1.0,ran,"Akira Kurosawa's sweeping period piece. The word ""epic"" gets tossed around alot these days, and most of the people who use the word, in regard to film, have no idea what the true meaning of the word is. This film is ""epic"". ""300"" is not!!!"
1.0,ran,"I'm not a huge fan of the story (ie Shakespeare's macbeth), the color, cinematography, emotion, and artistry are truly special.. if it is on story, i prefer his movie seppaku"
1.0,ran,Simply put: a must-see.
1.0,ran,Who would have thought that carnage could be beautiful?
1.0,ran,Another legendary movie.
1.0,ran,I only like Shakespeare when Kurosawa does it
1.0,ran,"This is my favorite Kurosawa film, which is saying a lot considering I love every single movie Kurosawa directed (yes, even Dreams)"
1.0,ran,"highly recommended Shakespearean adaptation by ""Seven Samurai"" famed Akira Kurosawa. an epic story of deathly family relations that shape the lands and sear them with flame."
1.0,ran,Kurosawa is perfection
1.0,ran,"Interesting that it took Japanese film master Kurosawa to make the best screen version of KING LEAR, transforming it into a samurai epic. Grand entertainment."
1.0,ran,Great Film can not add anything that has not been said before or better
1.0,ran,What can anyone say about Kurosawa? Absolutely amazing! Yet another interpretation of Shakespeare that I hasten to say may be better than the original.
1.0,ran,"Perfect. At least as epic as the source material, possibly more so."
1.0,ran,"Truly a masterpiece. Kurosawa reverts to an incredibly simplistic way of shooting a movie, yet that gives the story so much more weight, which is how it should be with Shakespeare. Kurosawa is a master, if all his other films didn't prove that, then Ran certainly sets it in stone."
1.0,ran,The greatest Shakespeare adaptation ever!
1.0,ran,Kurosawa at his very best!
1.0,ran,Il ricordo di una notte insonne passata ad ammirare un grandissimo film!
1.0,ran,So powerful I was literally awed. A masterpiece.
1.0,ran,My favorite Kurosawa movie. And that's saying a lot. Right up there with my favorites of all time. There is no way this movie could have been better. Perfect.
1.0,ran,"A masterful reimaging of ""King Lear"" and possibly my favorite Kurosawa movie of all time. Colorful, beautifully shot, and well-acted."
1.0,ran,King Lear set in Japan
1.0,ran,"Un monumento de peli­cula. Adaptacion japonesa de la obra de Shakespeare ""King Lear"". Cada detalle del filme es arte."
1.0,ran,"Kurosava gives perfectly in Japan the "" king Lear """
1.0,ran,"An epic masterpiece if there ever was one. I cannot find fault with a single aspect of this film. Like Shakespeare's tragedy, Kurosawa's tale is so beautifully dreary in tone, complemented perfectly by the picturesque imagery. If I could, I would frame every shot on a bare, boundless wall."
1.0,ran,amazing film that i think everyone should see
1.0,ran,Best Shakespeare adaptation ever.
1.0,ran,"Shakespeare and Samurai by Kurosawa, in color this time! A great movie, but you have to be prepared for the stylized Japanese approach to acting."
1.0,ran,"Kurosawa does Shakespeare, is there anything he CAN'T do? One of those films I have to call a masterwork."
1.0,ran,"kurosawa's take on king lear. you will feel the pain and sorrow here. you will ask yourself, why do we live amidst such pain and death?"
1.0,ran,"Huge, epic, and utterly brilliant. A true Kurosawa classic, the kind of film you will never see made again."
1.0,ran,"A stunning masterpiece of Japanese cinematography, Kurosawa-san seamlessly blends the romanticism of both feudal Japan and a true Shakespearean classic. This is one of my favorite movies of all time!"
1.0,ran,"Japanese King Lear. Great movie, great shots."
1.0,ran,A classic in my collection
1.0,ran,"Kurasawa's last movie was him at his best. More than King Lear, its predominantly pessimistic and dark tone contrasts starkly from some of Kurosawa's more impetuous movies. It is an epic delivered with strong theatrical and thematic elements."
1.0,ran,"My favorite film directed by Kurosawa (along with ""Ikiru""), this is the Japanese samurai version of King Lear. It should come to no surprise then that this is one depressing movie."
1.0,ran,"If Lawrence of Arabia is one man's epic, Ran is mankind's. Transcends culture. Kear Lear from The Master of narrative film."
1.0,ran,"Not a movie I can just watch any old day (long, and slow paced at times), but still perhaps my favourite from Kurosawa (or anybody else)."
1.0,ran,This movie made both Shakespeare and Japanese Cinema click for me. I owe much of the rest of my movie watching life to its greatness. -Ryan
1.0,ran,"Ran is Kurosawa at his best; brilliantly filmed on a grand scale. Kurosawa has an amazing ability to chronicle the faults of mankind in ways that are incredibly simple, yet powerful."
1.0,ran,"Great version of Samurai/Lear/Shakespeare, totally tragic and stunning realisation that God cries for man's injustice to man. Kurasawa outdid even himself here going beyond the culture to man's core essence. Beautiful to look at as a movie should be."
1.0,ran,this is like the best kurosawa's movie ever! not a single flaw can be found! a superb performance from tatsuya nakadai AS USUAL! who could ever forget the ending and the scenes where the castle burnt to the ground??
0.0,ran,"A legendary work of epic cinematic genius? Maybe, but I think it's fuck boring and have decided never to endure a Kurosawa movie ever again..."
1.0,ran,Perfect... anything else I say would just diminish this master piece.
1.0,ran,"Possibly one the best EVER. Kurosawa's direction, spotless. Shakespeare's storyline and charactes, awesome. Dialogues gracefully toned down. Acting, superb."
1.0,ran,Two towering masters meet: Shakespeare and Kurosawa
1.0,ran,It is the Grand Masterpiece of Akira Kurosawa.
1.0,ran,King Lear in Japanese. Beautiful beautiful cinematography (omg the battles) with great characters. Possibly the best epic tragedy I've seen.
1.0,ran,this movie is beautiful
1.0,ran,"Stunning! The battle sequences are drama and tragedy mixed with spectacle and lyricism. The whole film is beautifully made, with the tragedy of King Lear (on which it is based) and then some!"
1.0,ran,"This was an amazing film. The cinematography, the costumes, the script... I can see why it was nominated and won so many awards. The ending was very depressing and oh so Shakespearian. I recommend it to all.Btw, the trailer doesn't do this film justice."
1.0,ran,Akira Kurosawa is genious! Brilliant movie.
1.0,ran,fantastic! i especially love the colors and the banners and the crazy makeup on the father
1.0,ran,"If you sit down to see RAN, be prepared for a jaw-dropping experience. Akira Kurosawa-Shakespeare of the Japanese Film industry."
1.0,ran,"Kurosawa's ""painting on film"". possibly the most beautiful film (in colour and scope) ever made."
1.0,ran,"Overwhelming in its portrait of human blindness, consequence, and regret, ""Ran"" is a visual meditation that never stops giving, with moments of painterly beauty juxtaposed with terrible moments of violence. The haunting music cues in the large-scale battles will knock you on the floor."
1.0,ran,"One of the last movies made by the legendary Akira Kurosawa. Being almost completely blind when making ""Ran"", the crew had to rely on paintings Kurosawa had made to make this adaptation of Shakespeare's ""King Lear""."
1.0,ran,"The crowning achievement of a legendary career, it's a masterpiece on every level. One of the few adaptations of Shakespeare's works that lives up to the original as a work of art."
1.0,ran,Kurosawa was a painter too... it shows
1.0,ran,"Excelente adaptación del Rey Lear en manos de Kurosawa. La mejor dirección de arte que he visto, está en esta película."
1.0,ran,"With ""Ran"", Kurosawa takes the greatest play ever written to a whole new level and the end result is unbelievable."
1.0,ran,"Excllent very cool. A character driven epic full of loyalty, betrail, friendship and action. The battle scenes especially highlight the epic nature of the film as well as being historical acurate."
1.0,ran,"This film gets a wrap for holding a very depressing world view. Everything made sense though, power over family, suffering over religious sanctuary, etc. Seemed realistic in that vein..."
1.0,ran,"Another great from Kurosawa and one of the best retellings of ""King Lear""."
1.0,ran,"kurosawa's quickly becoming one of my favorite directors. it's absolutely thrilling to see him retell shakespeare's ""king lear"" in a way that stays faithful to the original while still leaving his unmistakable stamp on it."
1.0,ran,Kurosawa's last masterpiece.
1.0,ran,Kurosawa's last masterpiece.
1.0,ran,If you do not see this movie then you have no soul.
1.0,ran,"Drama épico dirigido por el inigualable Akira Kurosawa. Narra la historia del clan Hidetori, basado en una obra de William Shakespeare."
1.0,ran,Epic and one of the best adaptations of King Lear ever.
1.0,ran,"Another stellar performance from Kurasawa, at times the movie was hard to folow, but it was still very well done. Also was shot beautifully which you come to expect from his movies."
1.0,ran,Kurosawa doing what he does best!!!
1.0,ran,"epic, almost grandiose, but intimate and visually lyrical"
1.0,ran,Another favorite. The single most beautifully shot film ever made.
1.0,ran,"even though i've never actually read ""king lear"" i thought that the story was executed amazingly well. it's gripping and the japanese setting made it all the more spectacular. my favorite characters were hidetora dono and kaede sama. ^w^"
1.0,ran,"Facebook provides too small a space to do justice to a movie like this, so I'll just say that it has one of the most beautiful final images I've ever seen in a movie, right up there with Nostalghia."
1.0,ran,"Kurosawa has a tendency to drag it out, but this adaptation of the Shakespearian tragedy deserves it. A great film to watch despite its length and subtitles (unless, of course, you speak nihongo)."
1.0,ran,All-time-favoritt. Best-asian-movie....EVER!
1.0,ran,This may well be the best epic film ever made. It's certainly the best I have ever seen.
1.0,ran,I was becoming more and more emotionally attached to this movie as I was watching it.. definitely one of his best! I wonder how it would have been with Mifune.
1.0,ran,"Un tres tres grand film, pour un des plus grands realisateurs que la terre n'ai jamais portee!"
1.0,ran,"Excelente, la fotografÃ¬a y ambientaciÃ²n da el toque perfecto a una tragica hisoria donde los conflictos son transversales a sus personajes. Impacta la crudeza de las escenas de batalla y la lealtad de los samurais a su seÃ±or"
1.0,ran,there are really pretty colors and samurai charging each other.
1.0,ran,this film justifies the use of color for film. The stark use of it makes for visual masterpieces that should be required viewing for all art majors
1.0,ran,"Akira Kurosawa does big budget busy yet atmospheric King Lear meets samurai epic in glorious technicolour, featuring a mad dad, two no-good sons, one very angry woman, plus all out war. Absolute carnage. I loved this."
1.0,ran,Kurosawa is The Man.
1.0,ran,"An epic, moving and beautiful film. Kurosawa paints on a huge canvas but looses none of his trademark humanity, something that many a director mining for an Oscar can learn from these days..."
1.0,ran,"If there is such thing as a perfect film for me, I think this is as close as they get. There's nothing in this film I don't like. Visually mesmerizing, thematically powerful, emotionally haunting. I hate that something this good exists, because it forces me to face my own limitations."
1.0,ran,"To put it simply: King Lear where everyone actually has real motivations, rather than just being evil because the play needs a villain."
1.0,ran,As epic as epics get. Massive battle scenes would lead one to believe that making LOTR without any CGI would be possible.
1.0,ran,AMAZING!!! Kurosawa is a genius! One of the best war films I've ever seen.
1.0,ran,King Lear. Medieval Japan. Kurosawa. You haven't seen yet - Shame on you!!!!
1.0,ran,"This is a tragedy, one of the most bleak movies of all time. As well as one of the most perfect."
1.0,ran,"quite possibly the apex of kurosawa's brilliant career. his version of king lear, perfectly transposed to feudal japan is restrained, beautiful and tragic."
1.0,ran,Arguably the most beautifully shot and designed movie I've ever seen.
1.0,ran,Kurosawa's bloody take on Shakespeare's King Lear is a feast for both the senses and the mind.
1.0,ran,so nihilistic that you probably won't be able to sleep peacefully ever again. the tragedy of man's eternal search for bloodshed. yay.
1.0,ran,The only way I can describe this movie is as a masterpiece
1.0,ran,"Visually beautiful, especially towards the end, there's this a battle scene in slow motion w/ excellent music in the background. Almost surreal. Brutal."
1.0,ran,The battle at the third castle is one of the most beautiful pieces of film I've ever experienced.
1.0,ran,Kurosawa + Shakespeare = Masterpiece
1.0,ran,"Ran, simply put, is a cinematic masterpiece. The cinematography is absolutely perfect and precise, the shots and settings are beautiful and stunning, and the character development is complex and masterfully executed. Another excellent film by Akira Kurosawa."
1.0,ran,A fantastic & truly great film - Kurosawa's final great epic
1.0,ran,A Japanese re-rendition of Shakespeare and one that quite surpasses the original.
1.0,ran,Visually the most entertaining of Kurosawa's body of work.
1.0,ran,"Called the master's best film and for good reason. This is Kurosawa's adaption of King Lear, and he owns the material completely, making you think that Shakespeare stole his ideas from Japan."
0.0,ran,"Perhaps I'm not cultured enough, but I found this movie long and boring. It was pretty hilarious when the king was all confused and had flowers in his hair. But let's face it, I had not idea what was going on."
1.0,ran,Immense. The transposition of King Lear into Japanese cinema is inspired. The enormity and artistry of cinema has never done Shakespeare so much justice. And vice versa.
1.0,ran,A great Japanese King Lear! Powerful!
1.0,ran,"A riot of colour, violence and intrigue in this adaptation of King Lear from the master of period Japanese film."
1.0,ran,"Another stupendously good film from Kurosawa, this one an adaptation of King Lear. Ran is a stunningly powerful war drama and is unforgettable."
1.0,ran,"This is one of my top-five. Why? Certainly for the imagery (that's what the movies are about, if you ask me), more than the story (King Lear). The battle scene(s) are simply the best movie scenes ever done. Period."
1.0,ran,"This movie is the definition of Epic.  Plus, all the extras actually died. Japan is so xhardxcorex."
1.0,ran,"The greatest film ever made, by the greatest filmmaker of all time! It's long, though, and not for the casual film-goer. You won't get much out of it unless you are willing to ""read into it."" Don't watch it JUST for entertainment value, like so many losers out there do!"
1.0,ran,A classic by Kurasawa
1.0,ran,"All I have to say is that this should have won Best Picture in 1986. Instead the Oscar went to ""Out Of Africa"". Oh, the pain!"
1.0,ran,great movie enjoy kurosawa
1.0,ran,"Absolutely goddamn masterful. Released in the '80s (not 2000 like this site mysteriously says), this is Kurosawa's last true masterpiece. Probably my favorite film adaptation (however loose) of ""King Lear,"" and some of the best battle scenes in film history."
1.0,ran,Akira Kurosawa's best shot in my opinion! Great movie.
1.0,ran,This film is breathtaking. It is clearly Kurosawa at his best. Normally I despise interpretations of Shakespeare but this makes King Lear as poignant as ever.
1.0,ran,A Glorious masterpiece that all true movie lovers should see.
1.0,ran,Commanding. Epic. Majestic.
1.0,ran,My favorite all-time movie. Epic and bizarre yet poetic.
1.0,ran,This is one of Kurosawa's masterpieces. The film is a retelling in of King Lear on an epic scale. The battle scenes are terrific.
1.0,ran,Kurosawas's retelling of King Lear would made Shakespeare proud! Has the best battle sequence of all time as well!
1.0,ran,"it's a long movie, but it's worth it with the beautiful story."
0.0,ran,Snooooore Fest but I get that it's a classic...
1.0,ran,I remember this one from when I was little...still one of my faves!
1.0,ran,"Epic translation of King Lear twinned with the Japanese legend of three arrows. Performances range from excellent to sublime. Minamalist music sets of the immense beauty of the background. Builds up to a stunning culmination of loss, betrayal and murder. A perfect film."
1.0,ran,"Post-apocalyptic, despite the fact that it's set in the 1600's. A guttural lamentation to the miseries of the world."
1.0,ran,"loved many things about this movie and i am not blood thirsty, but that was some of the best blood spurting i have seen and the dying man holding his own severed arm. wow."
1.0,ran,"Yet again, superb work from Kurosawa."
1.0,ran,fantastic and beautiful movie
1.0,ran,Kurosawa is not a broom... ; )Inspired by Shakespear..
1.0,ran,amazing visions and depth.
1.0,ran,"I hate to say this, but this may be the greatest Shakespeare adaptation of all time."
1.0,ran,Blood is not thicker than water!
1.0,ran,one of my favorite films of all time; back before CG armies
1.0,ran,"Paranee, oka katselu kerta. Ja Maijakin alkoi heto odotella seuraavaa. Kertoo maailman lumipallo efektista, jonka ehka ihmiset voivat saada alkuun, mutta jota ei hallitse kukaan. Siita nimi ""sekasorto/kaaos"". Lisaksi nayttaa mita kay jos joku todella ymmartaa miten valo taittuu ja tekee elokuvan."
1.0,ran,"it is an excellent adaptation of king lear, the videotape we watched though must have been so sucky though because it looked like it was from the '70s"
1.0,ran,My heavens. Kurosawa's best? Probably. As good a film as Lear is a play.Yeah. It's that good.
1.0,ran,"the idea of remaking a Shakespeer masterpeice in another culture is great, Kurosawa pulled it off flawlessly...A perfect tragedy"
1.0,ran,- I am lost...- Such is the human condition.
1.0,ran,"A masterful film with amazing set pieces. It is worth trying to get a hold of the special edition of this film, as the DVD has a making of doc on it with behind the scenes footage of AK."
1.0,ran,Lear in Japanese sounds like a strange idea but this is vintage Kurosawa. The concepts of honour/dishonour and family are also very Asian as Kurosawa depicts. The visuals are a feast - see it on a big screen.
1.0,ran,The David Lean of Japanese cinema. I am truly ashamed to say i have only seen two Kurowaswa films. I dont know why?
1.0,ran,"One of the biggest, if not the biggest influence on film-making even to this day. Kurosawa truly captures you in this film, through beautiful visuals, unbelievable shots of Japanese landscapes, and more."
1.0,ran,"beautiful visuals, tried and true story expertly told, well acted, enormous armies on horseback executing maneuvering on the field? count me in!"
1.0,ran,"The most tragic, beautiful, and intense movie since Das Boot, and I think a considerable expansion and improvement on Shakespeare's tragedy of King Lear."
1.0,ran,Akiro Kirosawa is the man - George Lucus stole alot of ideas from him - shame on you George...but chur for the Empire Strikes back aye
1.0,ran,Yet another masterpiece by Kurosawa. I want to have his babies.
1.0,playtime,'Playtime' has no equivalent.
1.0,playtime,It's hard to put into words the achievements this film makes in every aspect of satire. I was expecting a more artful slapstick Chaplin-esque film and got something much more subversive.
1.0,playtime,"Fantastic, modern, brillant !"
1.0,playtime,"Loved Playtime, a masterpiece satiring 'modern' life and an obsession within people to leave / erase the past and been seen to own everything or be seen everywhere deemed acceptably fashionable despite how ridiculous it makes them look."
1.0,playtime,"Jacques Tati's hilarious parody of industrialization, over-population, and other contemporary facets is just as relevant today as it was in 1967. 4/4 - Knox Morris"
1.0,playtime,Playtime is a masterpiece of slapstick that finds the joy and the scorn in how high-tech and detached the world has become.
1.0,playtime,"A remarkable Jacque Tati classic. It's a delightful, inventive, charming, imaginative, light-hearted comedy that both satirizes and celebrates the modern world of technology."
0.0,playtime,"vicually captivating, Masterful use of various sounds and merticulous attention to the sounds, but overall I just didn't enjoy it.The plot seems to miss the point, and it felt like a a bunch of artistically interesting sounds bits and visual images, but nothing more."
1.0,playtime,"The combination of superb production design, amazing color schemes and the magics of 70mm depth of field make this film my favorite of all times. This is more than a movie, this is a deep dig into a world."
1.0,playtime,"A masterpiece!!! I couldn't stop laughing, which doesn't often happen. Jacques Tati is a genius and this movie is his best."
0.0,playtime,Whatever was funny about this in the 60's escapes me. This is one of the most dull movies I've seen. Does not withstand the test of time at all (and I'm from the 1960's)!
0.0,playtime,Total pseudo-intellectual arthouse garbage. This movie is so pretentious I wanted to kill myself three different times throughout.
1.0,playtime,Tati oozes originality.
1.0,playtime,For me this film should be seen on one's tv it needs a bigger screen than a laptop or even a desk top PC to revel it's beauty.
1.0,playtime,"Not a story, but a tremendous cinematic universe, that never stops to amaze with its detail and brilliance. An unbelievable film. Might be the greatest cinematic achievement of all time."
1.0,playtime,"An inspired, spirited farce of humanity breaking through the lifeless edifice of rigid modernity."
1.0,playtime,"Still in my top 3 movies of all time. Simple and silly, yet sublime and strong. A great riposte of Paris modernity that is still as relevant today for the whole modern world."
1.0,playtime,A delightful physical comedy which is wonderfully choreographed.
1.0,playtime,"One of the greatest films ever. Extremely fun, hilarious, inventive and continually perfect. My personal favorite of the M. Hulot films. It is absolutely gorgeous and brilliantly shot."
1.0,playtime,"Jaques Tati's masterpiece, and one of my personal favorite films. Its long, static shots and nearly simultaneous sight gags distinguish it as a classic piece of French cinema"
1.0,playtime,"Like peeking through a portal to a strange anachronistic land with its own customs and behaviors, Tati's highly amusing, nearly wordless masterpiece is more a film to be experienced than simply watched. Beautiful 70mm cinematography, incredible sound design. There is no other film quite like it."
1.0,playtime,Absolutely Love this movie!
1.0,playtime,"If you doubt Tati is a great director, notice the changes in tone and pacing in this. His best movie,"
1.0,playtime,scene: finale in street
1.0,playtime,"An truly mesmerizing kind of cinema; one that most people, myself included, are surprised by at first. One of my lifetime dreams is to see this on 70mm."
1.0,playtime,Jacques Tati's vision of space is just amazing... How could one live in a world made out only of concrete and glass?
1.0,playtime,"perfect vision of how things are today, totally unique"
1.0,playtime,What a fantastic movie! It reminds me of a painting that's always changing and moving. The remastered Criterion version looks greaton blu-ray. Check this movie out.
1.0,playtime,Visuele humor ten top! Deze film is puur genieten! Bovendien is deze film tegelijkertijd een commentaar op als een ode aan het modernisme. Faut le faire.Zo'n klassieker verdient dan ook 5 sterren!
1.0,playtime,"If Buster Keaton were Luis Bunuel he'd be Jacques Tati. An incredible achievement of humorous ballet form and comic mise en scÃ¨ne with themes reminiscent of Charlie Chaplin's ""Modern Times."" Not as obviously funny and breezy as ""Mr. Hulot's Holiday"" but perhaps even more brilliant."
1.0,playtime,Incredible chaos of absolute order!
1.0,playtime,One of the greatest (and most original) films ever made. Brilliant mise-en-scene ensures you can never tire of watching it. There is always something else to notice. It looks especially beautiful on bluray.

1.0,playtime,"Simple, yet profound, observations of human life in the increasingly alienating modern world"
1.0,playtime,Probably the best comedy i've ever seen that has almost no plot whatso
0.0,playtime,"This Mr. Magoo crap is pissing me off! Why do people care about this rube and his adventures in France? They made 3 of these? I have seen all 3 and they are pretty pointless, unless the point is that the French have the worst sense of humor on the planet."
1.0,playtime,"MisstÃ¤nker att Blake Edwards inspirerades av TatiÂ´s ""Playtime"" nÃ¤r han och Peter Sellers gjorde filmen ""The Party"" 1968."
1.0,playtime,"Now that I've seen it on blu-ray projected on my wall, I'm determined that this is one of the greatest achievements in film ever. Tati has made a film like no other before or since. You have to see this movie."
1.0,playtime,"A masterpiece of controlled chaos, comedy, and choreography. No filmmaker alive today has displayed anything near the visual brilliance conveyed here in every frame. That makes this a very special film, and makes today's cinematic climate kind of disappointing."
1.0,playtime,This is an absolute masterpiece.
1.0,playtime,This movie is unexplainable. You just have to see it. Trust me. A carefully orchestrated ensemble and visually stimulating movie. You'll get something different out of it with each viewing.
1.0,playtime,Best movie about modernism in culture and society!
1.0,playtime,"The best of Tati's Monsieur Hulot films and probably his best overall. As always, the Chaplin influences are there...particularly ""Modern Times"" for this one. You won't find a funnier predominately-slapstick film from the last 50 years."
1.0,playtime,Mind-boggling masterpiece
1.0,playtime,"What a joy. A visual dream, funny, mesmerizing and as its named, Playtime for adults. It felt like a brilliant short documentary, thats how enjoyable it is, as it is really 126 minutes long. It is superb, see it if you can."
1.0,playtime,"The most ""silent"" and sonically rich movie I have ever seen. ""Silent"" as in the narrative, there ain't much to ""say"" but we hear a lot! We hear bunches of sonic information...... Tati is amazing!"
1.0,playtime,"An outrageous, absurdist, intelligent comedy the style of which is totally unique. This is a movie that demands your attention, and rewards you richly for it."
1.0,playtime,It's like a french elevator music musical. Only imagine the music being pushed right to the background and the people populating the widescreen images making constant references to the perils of modernism. What a beautiful movie!
1.0,playtime,"An truly mesmerizing kind of cinema; one that most people, myself included, are surprised by at first. But that's why I love it. One of my lifetime dreams is to see this on 70mm."
1.0,playtime,A Glassic Masterpiece
1.0,playtime,"A perfectly choreographed, nearly balletic comedy. When you're not laughing, you're admiring. And you're often both."
1.0,playtime,An obvious influence of the Zucker brothers!
1.0,playtime,"Physical comedy genius. Writer, Director, Actor, Set designer."
1.0,playtime,"Brilliant, funny and no movie like it. Jacques Tati is a genius!"
1.0,playtime,A sophisticated yet hilarious look into the old and modern world of Paris.
1.0,playtime,So amazing - it allows you to give yourself over to a movie and fall in love with the modern world around you - a marvel to watch and experience and soak in over and over without losing an ounce of discovery.

1.0,playtime,"Un monumento filmico donde la modernidad, la ciudad, la cotidianeidad y los comportamientos naturales del ser humano entretegen el humor."

1.0,playtime,"Amazing, stylized, and original task of film making."
1.0,playtime,"An amazing film. There's almost no dialog, and very little in the way of a plot, but it doesn't matter. It's very funny and sweet. I want to live in Hulot's world."
1.0,playtime,"unspeakably beautiful. flaws, yes. but the kind of that live on with you as you try to repair them in your head"
1.0,playtime,"My favourite Tati's. An aesthete film, where picture tells much more than dialogs (hardly existing here)."
1.0,playtime,"One of the most unmarketable large format films out there. (Save Stan Brakhage's IMAX attempt, of course.)"
1.0,playtime,"A wholly unique and absorbing cinematic experience. Beautiful 70mm widescreen compositions featuring unbelievably detailed sets and precisely choreographed movement plunge the viewer into Tati's sleek, ultra-modern (but amusing) world."
1.0,playtime,see this as soon as possible. and over and over again. you'll be doing yourself a favor.
1.0,playtime,"My personal favorite of the Hulot films. Wicked humor and satire abound in this ""modernized"" Paris. How this film ever flopped is beyond me."
1.0,playtime,People act like this guy is pretentious. That's like saying that it's pretentious to watch kids play. People guard mediocrity pretty closely. It's the best foundation for consumerism.
1.0,playtime,After having a chance of seeing it again reminded me why this film is so highly regarded
1.0,playtime,"Few minds in cinema operate as strangely and playfully in a perfectionist manner. If you're a hardcore film-buff, it's a must."
1.0,playtime,Almost inconceivably brilliant.
1.0,playtime,"probably the greatest film of all time. if i had seen this in 1967, i wouldve expected the future of cinema to look like this. seeing it on the big screen is like watching a performance."
1.0,playtime,"Inside these frames the viewer has no predesigned guide of what we must see, while we get completely shallowed by the fascinating-mind-dumbing architecture of modern life. A masterpiece."
1.0,playtime,The best Jacques Tati's film! This is my favourite film all the time.
1.0,playtime,"""Playtime"" is one of the most interesting things ever to happen in the history of film.Watch it, read about it, watch the documentary, watch the film again."
1.0,playtime,What the fuck is this shit? Some guy in a trenchcoat wanders around for two hours looking for a bathroom -- by the time this was over I understood his dilemma.
1.0,playtime,"Playtime has no real plot and unless you totally engage yourself with the mise-en-scene you will hate. Yet, throughout the duration of this film, I couldn't stop smiling. I swear I didn't want it to end! The humor is subtle, clever and heartwarming."
1.0,playtime,"This isn't laugh-out-loud funny, this is more of a consistent-smile-on-your-face type of humour. But there are also poignant moments - the lost images of Paris reflected in glass, for example - that make this film so much more than a comedy."
1.0,playtime,what a pity this was the movie that ruined tall jacques' carrier.shame on the bloody cowards in the studios!
1.0,playtime,Tati's satire on the modernization of our culture is a terrific achievement in film-making. Funny and delightful. You haven't seen the beauty of cinema until you watch Playtime.

1.0,playtime,watching this movie was like having my greatest memories come streaming. Tati is a genius.
1.0,playtime,A work of art! Mise en escene parfait!Colour and Photography amazing! What a Film Director! That for me is the definition of a master piece of film making!
1.0,playtime,"What a beautiful and inventive film. Packed with sight gags and and physical humour, but combined with a thoughtful critique of modernist culture."
1.0,playtime,Mind-blowing. Tati is an indisputable genius; everything he touches is a masterpiece.
1.0,playtime,Totally astounding. Nothing like this had ever been made before (not even by Tati himself) and nothing like this will ever be made again. I would kill to see this on a big screen in the original 70mm. My favorite film.
1.0,playtime,"Ein av dei beste, mest for seg gjorte komedier som er laga. Ein hysterisk satire over modernismen."
1.0,playtime,Perhaps the most brilliant comedy ever put on film. I only wish I could see this on the big screen. It takes a few viewings to appreciate entirely.
1.0,playtime,Supermodernization of the modern world...Auge and the nonplace. Beautiful comedy.
1.0,playtime,"A Tati film is a visual workout, as each shot is loaded with subtle comedy forcing your eyes to wander the frame in search of silliness. An enjoyable comment on modern living and its effect on the Old World."
1.0,playtime,Comedy meets art - this film bears repeated viewings because there is always something to seen afresh - another Tati gem.
1.0,playtime,"Once again, Jacques Tati's character M. Hulot causes madness and mayhem in his attempts to understand modernity."
1.0,playtime,"Awesome comedy about the little things in life, the crazed future and the unavoidable nonsense of technology. There's no way you can just watch this... you have to lean forward, and pick out the details. For a movie so old, it still speaks to us. Also, the sight gags are hilarious."
1.0,playtime,"delicious, hilarious and surreal film about modernity and its nonsenses. Very stylish and so full of details that is one to be seen again"
1.0,playtime,"One of the few truly unique films that I've seen. It's also one of the funniest. In a way it's ""physical"" comedy. But it extends beyond that. Each movement and interaction makes a statement on man and his relationship to the post-modern Habitrail that he populates."
1.0,playtime,This is the greatest movie ever made.
1.0,playtime,"So epic, yet hardly any plot. Hilarious and beautiful, really an amazing film."
1.0,playtime,"An inexplicably wonderful film. One of the few that elevates Cinema to an actual art. But it can be ""difficult"" to watch, especially for ""modern audiences""."
1.0,playtime,"Tati's use of 70mm has to be seen on a big screen to be believed. Some of the best blocking ever imagined, and a movie that interrogates the absurdity of modern industrial Parisian life (Similar to Godard at the same time) only with out being heavy handed."
1.0,playtime,Favorite Movie. I need to find a way to see in in 70mm.
1.0,playtime,Never before has architecture been so funny.
1.0,playtime,Kjære Jacques. Det her e komplett brillianse. Hilsn Sigbjørn
1.0,playtime,"I have seen this film in just about every format now: video, DVD, 30mm, 70mm (Yes, yes--70MM!!). Nothing can compare with seeing it on the big screen. You have my permission to be jealous!"
1.0,playtime,"Mr. Hulot meets modernity, shot in 70mm. Beautiful and absurd."
1.0,playtime,"Filmen har en genuin positivitet over seg, samt at jeg ofte føler meg som Mr. Hulot gjør filmen til en av mine favoritter."
0.0,playtime,Just Crap. i was forced to see that in my movie class
1.0,playtime,Tati's tragic masterwork -- this film only gets better with multiple viewings
1.0,playtime,"tremendous fun with visual jokes and ""gentle slapstick"", but also a deep commentary on modernity. Tati is in complete control of all the filmic elements. Truly magnificent"
1.0,playtime,"I can not comprehend how Tati manage to capture so many details in one single frame. The settings, the laughs, the subtle acting, its such a huge accomplishment which words cannot describe. Modernistic masterpiece."
1.0,playtime,"'A film that comes from another planet, where they make films differently' -- François Truffaut"
1.0,playtime,Ah Tati. Not my favorite of his but still a really really amazing film.
1.0,playtime,"This is my all-time favorite film. It might take two or three tries to really get into it, but it pays off."
1.0,playtime,"Such a cool looking film! The third, and final film in Jacques Tati's Mr. Hullot series. Probably his most mature. Check this out, but start in order, M. Hulot's Holiday, Mon Oncle, and then this one"
1.0,playtime,Another Tati-classic!
0.0,playtime,"I wouldn't recommend watching this movie sober, although I am not sure alcohol alone would enable me to get through it."
1.0,playtime,Greatest movie ever? Perhaps.
1.0,playtime,Unlike any movie ever made before or since! The perfect ballet of visual action and human comedy so enchanting the film grows until a top shape ending. Jacques Tati's most underrated masterpiece and one of the most beautiful films of all time.
1.0,playtime,"As one of the most breathtaking films in history, Playtime is an unparalleled experience that I presume will get better with subsequent viewings."
1.0,playtime,A masterpiece of choreography. Every time I watch it I find something new to marvel at!
1.0,playtime,"Mixing slapstick comedy with a distict undertone of cynicism toward the modern age, Tati was able to produce hilarious and poignant comedies featuring one of my absolute favourite characters of all time, M. Hulot (played by Tati himself)."
1.0,playtime,See it in 70mm or don't see it at all.
1.0,playtime,Fantastic and fun movie!
0.0,playtime,maybe a bit to ... old? artistic? dunno
1.0,playtime,"A unique film - visually one of the most stunning i've seen and as fresh as a daisy now as it was when first released. Tati was a genius and this is his 'Modern Times' except it is much, much better."

1.0,timbuktu_2015,"Fuerte, extremo y poderoso. Fotografía impecable."
0.0,timbuktu_2015,I was super disappointed in this movie. I kept waiting for something wonderful to happen. But it never did. How did this movie get such great reviews????
1.0,timbuktu_2015,"Beautiful, tragic tale. Amazing, quiet acting and gorgeous photography."
1.0,timbuktu_2015,"man, people will hate this condition"
1.0,timbuktu_2015,Heartwrenching. A must see to understand the difference between true Islam and terrorists who use Islam to control and exploit those who are weaker.
1.0,timbuktu_2015,Saw this film today and found it exquisitely directed and quite thoughtful in its portrayal of the clash of values and ideals within today's practice of Islam. Great portrayal of the starkness and beauty of the Sahel.
1.0,timbuktu_2015,I wound mine seen this movie with my mom?
0.0,timbuktu_2015,"When this wasn't totally boring me, it was horribly depressing."
1.0,timbuktu_2015,"Excellent film - visually stunning, heartbreaking, honest."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,my favorite film ever
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"The best foreign film I've watched, thus far. Its so good that writing a review would take too much time, but let me just say this: This is a film EVERY person should watch and a film that will still be important a CENTURY from now."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Erich von Stroheim was as always superb in this movie. Thank you Jean Renoir for this beautiful film with such a great message.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the most crucial and humanist of films.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Simple yet emotionally complex. An anti-war story about patriotism, war, brotherhood and humanity. La Grande Illusion served as an influence to many future filmmakers dealing with the topic of war. Sad, funny and moving all at once!"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the best movies of all time. I've never had such a strong urge to watch a movie a second time right after seeing it.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A terrific masterpiece that should be known and watched by everyone. Its important anti-war message, along with powerful topics such as friendship and humanity, makes this film an essential viewing experience. A masterful classic that will continue to be admired and studied in years to come."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Greatest Foreign Language anti-war movie, aside from being a great movie on its own terms. Admirable restoration!"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Like All Quiet on the Western Front, this film is still one of the best war films ever made."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"One of the few films that rank among the best of any art form. Shocking and brave for it's time, the progressive ideology of the film is more progressive than most films out today."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"An incredible film, with such a brilliant message and such a well thought out manner of portraying it that it deserves its place as one of the greatest films ever made."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Classic perfect film. Old film that is entertaining enough for modern filmgoers to enjoy throughly. For those who may want to watch the film more studiously pay attention to how the film deals with its major themes (race, class, war)."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"An arrestingly humanistic, anti-war masterwork, in part thanks to the camera's light and calm motion."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,It's a beautiful film. Not just for the way it looks but what it says & how it moves.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,There's a reason this is always listed among the best film's ever made. It is. The restoration brings Renoir's perfect cinematography to new clarity. Von Stroheim's performance is quietly elegant. You cannot call yourself a film fan until you see this.

1.0,la_grande_illusion,"simple story with characters both subtle and heartfelt, it's timeless, moving, and easy to love."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,A classic that moves one on many levels. See it if it's playing nearby.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Jean Renoir aims high with this film. Renoir exceeds this and he doesn't miss a beat. After you watch this film, you feel so emotionally drained. Outstanding achievement in telling the story and cinematography. Just as political as it is emotional. My personal 2nd favorite film ever."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Brilliant film. Nuff said
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Admit it: you wish you could be as cool as Jean Gabin.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,The 75th Anniversary restoration is absolutely beautiful. Grand Illusion is a powerful and unforgettable film.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,My first (movie) Criterion that I purchased. How can a guy forget his first?
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Le monde change devant nos yeux. Film absolument superbe!
1.0,la_grande_illusion,[i]Review coming soon.[/i]
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Probably the most fun I've ever had with an anti-war film. Renoir's film is rich in flair, thematic material and humor, and earns every right to be considered one of the most important films of all time. Casa Blanca, took more than a few cues from this."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Perhaps not Renoir's most radical film, but in my opinion his most moving, about the dislocations created by war and the at times futile struggles of men to stay somehow connected--to friends, to social classes, to lost conventions."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Oh sweet Jesus, so much deep focus. Such a good story. Such great directing. Sublime acting. I LOVE IT!"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Sublime, serene, and elegiac. I watch this once a year and that may not be enough. I'm not sure what's more sad: the horrors of war, or trying to place a gentleman's agreement on top of the whole mess. A true 10-star masterpiece."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Great Jean Renoir war film about officers and the death of the nobility in World War 1. Renoir is one of the best directors of all time, and this is one of his best movies."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,ExperiÃªncia cinematografica cinco estrelas. Um filme que quase desapareceu da histÃ³ria do cinema mundial.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A beautiful, subtle, humane, enormously influential look at war, the people who fight on both sides, and a system of the world that was inexorably on its way out, for better and for worse."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Renoir is easily one of the greatest directors of all time
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Jean Renoirs La Grande Illusion er intet mindre enn ett tidlÃ¸st mesterverk! Jean Gabin, Pierre Fresnay og Erich Von Stroheim spiller hovedrollene i dette episke verket om vennskap og aristokrati. En klassiker!"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Grand Illusion is a timeless peace of cinema forever ensured to be remembered generation by generation. It`s just a remarkable film you have to experience for yourself.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"I love that the original P.O.W film is the one that manages to break the stereotypes, the WW1 setting also adds an extra dimension awesome"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,c juste trop grandiose!!!
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A magnificent film which questions the very nature of our social and ethnic divisions. Offers in the grimmest of contexts, when all the divisive prejudices have sunk along with all prior notions of civilization, the possibility for a new model of pacifism, humanism and egalitarianism to emerge."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Very exciting and extremely ingenious
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"It's a curious film. The title is purposely misleading. The ""illusion"" doesn't have to do with escaping from any POW camp."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A very layered, and thoughtful work. Fantastic use of a disjointed 3-act structure. I think I prefer to The Rules of the Game. 9.5/10"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Never have I seen an Anti-War film so impressionable; one of the deepest, most critical films of its century."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,one of the 10 greatest films I have ever seen...
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A intelligent and subtle way of expressing the fear of war through the people effected by it. Some directors today still feel righteous to show heroism during war, where in fact Renoir's anti war message is considerably more apt."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Renoir is the bomb. A prison camp film from WWI with a unique perspective. Finely acted and thought provoking.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,There are some minor flaws but mostly this is incredible. Good on him for making it right before WWII. It's shocking how much The Great Escape steals from this movie.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"My favorite Renoir, and starring the great Jean Gabin and Erich von Stroheim"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,A fantastic war film that has had a clear influence on nearly every other escape movie since.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Fantastic film from Renoir! I was shocked and a bit moved by the scene where the prisoners of war find pleasure in looking at women's clothing. Just one of many scenes that make this a rare and unbeatable war film.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"There are so many good things about this movie. The cast is perfect for a start. The guts Renoir showed in making it. The arc of the story. The triumph and tragedy of it's characters. And Erich Von Stroheim, what a guy!"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,The best french movie ever made?
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"The first ""P.O.W. Escape"" movie, and by far the best"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the best films ever.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Truly powerful, poignant, and moving."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"der film hat mir sehr gefallen, will mehr filme von renoir sehen. erich von stroheim ist ja auch in sunset bv."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,It's amazing how real this movie feels.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,I had forgotten how flabbergastingly great this thing is. Just astonishing. Renoir's introduction is a must.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,I saw this in my TFM class and it's one of the oldies but goodies. Really romance driven.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A beautifully optimistic tribute to human nature in the face of the tragic idiocy (or ""grand illusion"") of nationalism, class, ""duty"", politics and everything else that divides us."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,An amazing film with some very amusing moments. A classic must-see Jean Renoir film!
1.0,la_grande_illusion,a testament to humanity in the midst of war
0.0,la_grande_illusion,"When you really sit down and talk about it, World War is silly, don't you think? I mean, instead of fighting we could, I don't know, be drinking wine or eating cheese . . ."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"The most unique WWI film I have seen. No attempt to show the trenches, but the relationships of people. I enjoyed, hmm-mmm."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"I hadn't seen this in years! This is a newly restored version, and it's poetry. Lots of movies demonstrate that war is hell, but this is a rare movie that says that war can bring out the best in an individual."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the greatest films ever made!
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Nice little ""surviving adversity"" film with a sorta/kinda happy ending. Oh, wait...what's this subplot about class? Or antisemitism? Or relationships transcending politics/class/language? WTF! Why is all this serious stuff in my entertainment?"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"If this isn't the greatest movie ever made, it's certainly in the top 20. There is layer upon layer of subtext and social commentary in this film, on top of a pretty gripping story. It's much more than a POW film, and it's worth seeing at least once in a lifetime."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,A great anti war film. GW would ban it if he could...
1.0,la_grande_illusion,the great classic. everyone should have seen it
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the best movies of all time!
1.0,la_grande_illusion,You've heard of this for a reason. It's one of the best films ever made. It's silly to say anything more. But it certainly holds up more than well.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A very nice, fun film. It deals with everything from war to class to race in a prison camp environment. A classic brilliant film."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Consistently number one or two on my list of greatest films of all time. Pure cinematic poetry. Unforgettable.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"An amazing, deeper-than-expected film by Jean Renoir. It's a complex look at war, and the fracturing and bringing together that it is capable of. Humor is wisely weaved in, and with a superb cast, this film tackles the war with whole-hearted conviction."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A beautiful film in many ways. Renoir's constantly moving camera provides the film with a wonderful kineticism. I was surprised at how funny the film was, which works in its favor and makes its anti-war message that much more poignant."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"My favorite movie of all time. Probably one of the earlier anti-war films, it takes place, mostly, in a prisoner-of-war camp during WWI, and depicts the class struggle on both sides of the conflict."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Most nuanced war movie I've ever seen. Incredible.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,un chef d'oeuvre : humour a la Audiard avant Audiard et humanité en temps de guerre. magnifique
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"If we through Bogart and Gable in this bad boy we have the Beatles of early sound film. This all star cast and amazing director combine powers to create a film that has stood the test of time for over 70 years. Erich von Stroheim is the coolest sad, old man in the history of cinema... maybe."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,The 86% of people 'not interested' in seeing this film should be ashamed.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Something that great films have in common is that they stretch across more than 3 acts. There is a reason why most critics include this film in their 'top 5' list of greatest films.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the greatest war movies ever.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"fabulous. lots of later 50s war films (great escape, colditz story) are copies of this. class, ethics, camaraderie, friendship, love. in the usual, surprisingly 'modern' style of all Renoir's films and the French 'c'est la vie' realistic attitude. I BLOODY LOVE RENOIR FILMS"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the best movies ever made
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Probably the best war movie ever. Steve McQueen's ""Great ""Escape"" was a dumbed-down version of this film. There are class struggles, castle escapes, WWI tearing apart Europe, solitary."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Absolument merveilleux sur le plan humain.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A movie for all time about man-made caste systems, ethnic and country divisions. Questions the true nature of honor."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Powerful movie... one of the 3 best films I've ever seen (with Citizen Kane and The Godfather Pt. II). Gabin is incredible! I used to have the Criterion Collection DVD of this film; sadly, I sold it a couple of years ago."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Hitler called it Cinematic public enemy number one. Amazing stuff, heavily borrowed by Casablanca but a richer film that is the true father of all anti-war movies"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A magnificent film which questions the very nature of our social and ethnic divisions. Offers in the grimmest of contexts, when all the divisive prejudices have sunk along with all prior notions of civilization, the possibility for a new model of pacifism, humanism and egalitarianism to emerge."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,AWESOME! I loved it. I think Professor Dine-Young for having film class watch it because sadly I would have never picked it up on my own.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,the passing of the old guard
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A war film where only 1 shot is fired. This, Paths Of Glory & The Deer Hunter are the finest films about the absurdity & horror of war --if you ask me."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A grand masterpiece with a great trio of actors, Jean Gabin, Fresnay and Stroheim. A must see anti-war movie."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Ultimately through the visuals of the endless, snowcovered, Swiss Alps Renoir teaches the viewer that the borders humans create are not recognized by nature, but rather just a grand illusion."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"""Frontiers are an invention of men. Nature doesn't give a hoot."""
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Le film pacifiste par excellence. Il raconte la fin d'un monde, prophetise les horreurs de la deuxieme guerre mondiale qui s'annoncait a l'epoque, tout en affirmant l'humanite de tous les etres humains, sans exception. Les pseudo-pacificistes de notre epoque devraient en prendre de la graine..."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,To all you people who spend your afternoons writing long reviews of various Jennifer Lopez romantic comedies: You goddamn peasants wouldn't good cinema if it shot you in the face.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"renior's son as director. awesome, scary monicale guy was tight."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Are you kidding me?! One of the best films ever made. Beautiful film, I could go on for minutes about how lovely this film is. Stroheim is fantastic!"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the best war films I have ever seen. Well worth a watch or two.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Not optimistic. The way I like my movies. lol.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,A classic...a pacifist tale about being a prisoner during WW1 and written just before WW2...still very modern
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Ultra classique, cette oeuvre pacifique a reconcilie le temps d'un film la gauche et la droite des annees 30, qui pourtant se detestaient plus que Sarkozy et Laguiller. C'est dire la qualite du film."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Aristocracy, jewes, common people and the meaningless of wars. Great drama."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Greatest war film of all time?Could be.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,So good that I blatantly copied part of it for one of my 290s.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,So good that I blatantly copied part of it for one of my 290s.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A truly moving French classic about WW1. Performances are great, and the work of Renoir deserves 5 stars."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"One of the best ever, and best by renoir - and also amongst the best war movies ever."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Perhaps the best look at the insanity of World War I and the breakdown of European societies, from which they've arguably never really recovered."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,it's the best pacifist movie ever.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"GIRL IN WHITE: We saw ""Grand Illusion"" here last night.ALVY AND ANNIE (In unison) Oh, yeah?MAN ON THE SOFA (Looking over his shoulder at the group) That's a great film if you're high."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Perhaps the best anti-war film ever made.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"You have to see it for yourself to really understand why ""La Grande Illusion"" is pretty perfect as far as I can tell--to the point of feeling like it was made by someone magical or with a supernatural perspective."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,both Woody & I like this one
1.0,la_grande_illusion,easily one of the top 3 movies ever made
1.0,la_grande_illusion,the best anti-war film ever made!
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"un film de guerre humaniste, mais oui c'est possible."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,svartvit klassiker som handlar om grundläggande värderingar.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Prefect thoughout. Touching, deep, and full of social commentary. Both the cinematography and acting are ahead of thier time. I'm amazed that both Jean Gabin Erich von Stroheim were not awarded oscar nominations for thier performances."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the best film ever
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Le meilleur Film Anti-Guerre realise un peu avant la Deuxieme Guerre et tellement encore d'actualite! Une Grande lecon!
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"This is one of the best Anti war films I have ever seen. It describes the tragedy of the first world war so well, showing the changes to society that occur at that time perfectly."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,I watched it on TV in Japan. It was truely a piece of humanistic work.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Probably my favorite movie of all time, shot by the famous painter's son, beautiful depiction of gentlemanly peace in wartime. We're all just humans after all."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,A profound statement for peace. Starts as a prisoners-of-war picture but soon moves beyond genre and achieves... humanity.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Perhaps the finest WWI film ever. An anti-war film made at the brink of WWII.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,jean gabin is a sexy man
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Every good radical, socialist, idealist, anarchist, anti-nationalist, pacifist, humanist, and on and on should see this movie."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"In a cast of brilliant actors, I must single out Erich von Stroheim as the MOST brilliant! And that final scene, on skis. does NOT let you go!"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,My kind of war film.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A beautiful film in so many ways. Taken at face value, the film is entertaining as is. Delve below into the messages and implications of the story, though, and you'll find a bittersweetly intricate tale of human interaction and conflict and the strife that it so often carries."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A classic movie that defies easy classification. I would not call it simply ""anti-war""; war is mostly distant. Perhaps it is mostly about people in a situation that forces them the make ultimate choices of displaying what they are, or what they would like themselves to be."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,La Grande illusionUn classique magnifique et toujours d'actualité! Le combat des classes sociales! Tourné avant la 2ième guerre!!! ( 10/10 )
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Perhaps not Renoir's most radical film, but in my opinion his most moving, about the dislocations created by war and the at times futile struggles of men to stay somehow connected--to friends, to social classes, to lost conventions."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Lieutenant Rosenthal: Frontiers are an invention of men. Nature doesn't give a hoot.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,How can you make a war movie that's this witty and humane without trivializing its subject? Amazing. And the camera work is unrivaled (except by Bunuel).
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Excellent composition on war, culture, and class."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the truly great films.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"One of the most important movies ever made, reminding us of where our loyalties ultimately lie."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Absolute classic - and Jean Gabin is gorgeous!
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the finest films ever made and banned by Goebbels. A quintessential study on struggles of war and class.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Very rich metaphors, fabulous acting, very touching end scene...Rich portrayal of the war times and the never ending differences between nations...Very glad to have seen it..."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Far too overshadowed by its near-contemporary Rules of the Game, I think it's a masterpiece. Gabin and von Stroheim are outstanding, and the relationship that develops between them really gives a glimpse of what could have been had not the catastrophe of the Great War intervened."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Movies don't get much better than this.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Hay que ver este filme. Muuuy bueno, entretenido e inteligente. Grandes actuaciones, excelente guion y puesta en escena."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A story of class and nationality in the First World War, told with Renoir's characteristic intricacy."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"What a brilliant movie, brilliant sequencing of WW I and WW II, a good example of poetic realism and the ironies and bitterness of life."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the greatest prison escape movies of all time with so much energy and enthusiasm.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,An incredibly powerfal piece for it's time. It's scary to think this was almost lost forever when the Nazi's occupied Paris...
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"The absurdity of war, the death of class privilege and the brotherhood of man. All in one great film."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,A beautiful film that is so real and alive. It takes a long time and lot of viewings but the payoff on this film is incredible.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Orson Welles said if he could only save one film it would be this one. Nuff said.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Renoir would be proud. the disection and evolution of class, a timeless story."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"This film says so much about the futility of war. It especially looks into the future,and it's message says a lot about what's going on now as it did in the 1930s."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Takes on the grand illusions which an organized society fabricates to make sense of the world, and which we ourselves use to put ourselves in our place. As good as Renoir gets. Which is pretty dang good."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,My favourite movie of all time. I don't know what else to say.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"It's a Jean Renior film, what else can I say?"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Jean Renior's flawless war fable delivers one of the densest portraits of combat ever filmed.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Where all those prison escape movies came from. Great characters and unexpected plot.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Jean Gabin + Renoir = perfection.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"For all those who consider The Shawshank Redemption to be the greatest prison escape movie ever made, perhaps they need to take a look at Renoir's outing and reconsider."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,There's Jean Renoir and then there's everyone else. It's kind of true after you see this film. What a solid picture! A miracle of a film until you realize the sublime heartand mind of the artist in charge!
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A great political film. It's not just anti-war, it's also anti-jingoism. It's incredibly level-headed for an film produced by a French director on the eve of WWII."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Probably my favorite film by Jean Renoir - and that's saying something! A sophisticated reflection on class and civility during the Great War. Featuring some of the finest acting the camera ever captured, Renoir's Grand Illusion stands deservedly as one of the cinema's all time greats."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Certainly my favourite film. I prefer it to Rules of the Game. A most beautiful and humane film.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,An unmatched look at the farce of war and a clear proof that you don't need any bulletholes to make a war classic.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of those films that just makes you go 'whoa.' Needs to be seen on the big screen.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"One of the greatest french films ever made, and my personal favorite of renoir's. His humanism is strikingly apparent in this film. It is amazing."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,It's a real shame wars aren't fought like this anymore. Hell I'd probably sign up.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the best movies I've ever seen. I both rue and lament the end of the UC Theatre.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,86% of people are not interested. Jesus Christ.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Super amazing classic. Even if you're not into old movies or things outside your national language, you should still give Grand Illusion a try."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,So incredibly beautiful. I am speechless about this movie.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,A great movie with a timeless message. The characters are fully developed and it showcased Renoir at his best.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Top 3 movies ever, and easily Renoir's best. Well, I shouldn't say easily since all of Renoir's stuff is great. But top three, easy."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Absolutely fantastic! A french masterpiece from Jean Renoir - the nazis tried to destroy it during the war, but by luck it survived. Watch this movie. Watch it now."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A powerful film from the french master, Renoir. Jean Gabin gives an excellent performance alongside many others."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"""I think we can do nothing to stop the march of time."" My favorite Renoir film, a anti-war film that doesn't show the war."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,As close to perfection as any film ever made.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"You can't beat the work of the great Renoir. Plus Jean Gabin is very cool to watch. Despite being a war film, war is left off screen, leaving character development through dialog to bring the plot to fruition."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"'For a commoner, dying in a war is a tragedy. But for you and I... it's a good way out.'"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"My first Renoir! And oh-my-goodness, what a doozie!"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Von Stroheim is terrific in this. Heck, it's full of incredible performances. One of my favorite films of all time."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the greatest war movies ever. Plus the cover of the DVD features the greatest hair cut ever.

1.0,la_grande_illusion,"The first prison escape film, and certainly the best."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"As a aspiring filmmaker, this film compels me in many ways. It is a great work that is truly brilliant. The idea of a man battling the human psych for untold riches. Who ignores all social requirments to find his one and only city of gold. It is a masterpiece that should live on forever."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"This film rocks, ticking slowly towards its inevitable conclusion. The picture is shot beautifully with long shot duration takes. It is very powerful and I enjoyed it very much."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Less the God of Wrath, more of The Lord of The River Flies. It's short, but an epic film of grand proportion and might."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"While it was a little odd hearing Conquistadors speaking German, that can quickly be forgiven as no other actor could have embodied Aguirre so well. This is a captivating tale of greed, obsession and insanity, with breathtaking visuals and camerawork."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Aguirre is a masterful, poetic examination of the collision of humanity and nature, with a brilliant script that brilliantly juggles its selfish characters, but yet allows them to be human."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,This harsh film is also a fascinating show of power and it's effects.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Visually stunning with live colors and epic haunting atmosphere because of Werner Hertzog's cold touch and Klaus Kinski's frightening performance. A true masterpiece in cinema history.

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Herzog and Kinski team up and produce an intense journey into madness, greed and death. Its influence over Coppola's 'Apocalypse Now' is evident and admired."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"An incendiary, nightmarish journey into hell that obscures the line between ambition and madness. Klaus Kinski delivers one of the most menacingly crazed performances imaginable. Historical epics don't get less romantic than this."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"A band of conquistadors led by a megalomaniac face mutiny, cannibals, & the unyielding forces of nature as they float down a river to their slow demise. The juxtaposition between man's horrible fate & the natural beauty of the world is awesomely portrayed in this must-see German film."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,A perfect film and truly iconic Art House classic.

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"One of the greatest pieces of German cinema, it depicts a nightmarish trip into the depths of the South American jungle, with a haunting performance by Klaus Kinski and a setting that couldn't be more beautiful."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,The brilliance of Herzog's approach is in how the film transforms over time from looking almost like a History Channel recreation to a cinematic spectacle as Aguirre's grip on reality loosens.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Such an amazing piece of film. It captures the psyche of the conquistadores and lays it out in a really depressing tale. Really fantastic!
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"There is no ""Apocalypse Now"" without ""Aguirre."" Pre-documentary Herzog at his best. Stunning and haunting, ""Aguirre"" is everything the historical film should be, and a significant influence on global cinema in the 70's and beyond."

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,A great film! A descent into madness on an insane quest for the city of El Dorado. Kinski is perfect in this role. A true Herzog classic!
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Disorienting film that ends very powerfully. Kinski's ambitious madman compares to that of Brando's Colonel Kurtz in Apocalypse Now as the greatest acting performances I've ever seen. A lot of worthwhile dialogue and imagery. One of the best endings to a film ever.

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Incredible Cinema. Herzog shows film how it should be - epic, grandiose and just seemingly dangerous. On the edge at all times, Kinski seems possessed by the search for gold and will let nothing get in his way. A must-see film and a moment in Cinema history."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Werner Herzog's greatest work. A haunting and doomed fever dream into madness.

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Everytime I watch it, I slip deeper into its strange, alienating, feverish universe"
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Herzog has a distinct talent for completely enveloping an audience into a different time and place and mood than we are used to occupying in cinema.

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Brilliant. Completely mad in front and evidently behind the camera. The legendary partnership of Kinski and Herzog is born. And so is my fascination... Herzog is very easily climbing up the pile that is my list of favourite directors. More to come I hope.

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Simply one of the finest movies ever done, however, not for the American crowd who require gunfights and explosions every 3 minutes to hold their attention. Surreal photography, cinematography and soundtrack. The themes presented are timeless through man's history."

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Don't let the cover fool you, this is one of the best movies ever made, it is like someone took there handheld camera traveled back hundreds of years and started filming actual events, and Kluas Kinski turns in such a wonderful performance."

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"A 20th century masterpiece, built out of blood, sweat and complete madness."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Incredibly haunting film. This movie obviously had a lot of influence on the making of Apocalypse Now, which automatically earns the film its due. Not very character driven, with the exception of Klaus Kinski's mad eyed Aguirre, the movie induces a mood that stays with you well after seeing it."

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"More or less a perfect film, with the most fantastic establishing shot you will ever see, and a final scene that is unforgettable. And all the bits in between are fabulous too."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,One of Werner Herzog's masterpieces and notably his first film working with Klaus Kinski. You really have to see this film for yourself to understand what all the hype is about. See this film.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Unbelievable film, blurs the line between fiction and fact in true Herzogian style and features a manic, inspired explosion of a performance by Klaus Kinski. I won't try and sum it up, just see it!"

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Herzog and Kinski score big with this one. The initial build up is slow but when things get going they get going. One of the most haunting depictions of a descent into madness ever on film.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Great movie with a great soundtrack by Popol Vuh, what it lacks in action it makes up in tension, and Aguirre's slow descent into madness is unnerving yet convincing. Fantastic little find of a movie which deserves more praise :)"
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"One of a kind, must-watch movie. Considered by TIME magazine to be one the best 100 films ever made. Klaus Kinski at his manic best."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Wow! This film explains the origin of our exploitation. Ironically, done by a german director. Great movie."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,One of the greats. every shot is mesmerising and the opening sequence is so haunting. Kinski and his raft overrun by monkeys at the end is one of the great images of cinema.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Although I am not a big fan of Herzog, I liked this film a lot. A dark parable about a bunch of Spaniards on a raft who want to conquer Latin America."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Ingeniously combines Herzog's gift for deep irony, his strong social awareness, and his worthy ambition to fashion a whole new visual perspective on the world around us via mystical, evocative, yet oddly direct imagery. It is a brilliant cinematic achievement"

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,A masterpiece. One of Herzog's best films and perhaps Kinski's best performance. The last shot is as striking as any before or since.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,An amazing movie from start to finish.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"First collaboration between Herzog and Kinsky and... bingo: well deserved success. As with a number of Herzog productions, the story of making Aguirre (the character based on infamous Lope de Aguirre) is nearly as fascinating as the film itself. And there wouldn't have been ""Apocalypse Now""."

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Add a review (optional)...
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"The madness of Aguirre mirrors the madness of Kinski. The editing and action mirrors the rapidity of the Amazon. Where the river fans out and become serene, so does its action while the madness is increased. Amazing!"

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,The Heart of Darkness as played out in Peru instead of Congo with Kinski playing a most diabolical variation of Kurtz. Herzog's use of the intense and natural beauty juxtaposed against the evil of power ambitions is very compelling.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"The powerful and near demonic screen presence of Klaus Kinski, combined with the very real danger of the nature that surrounds him and Herzog's gift for making every shot count, is quite remarkable."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"The best sort of film: one that sticks in your mind and stays there, whispering to you. Like Picnic At Hanging Rock, this is a slow film of small incidents, and it leaves the audience to construct what they will from it. Wonderful and enlightening stuff."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"I have to go and lower some other movie's scores now. Hypnotic and visually dynamic, the cinematography and Kinsky's performance make for a disturbing combination."

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"a hypnotic voyage into madness. This is not a film for everybody, it is surreal and bizarre. If you are new to Herzog it may be a bit much. It is though a grand allegory about madness, greed, desperation, and barbaric violence."

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Kinski is just scary as the conquistador, Aguirre. There's a moment where he's watching an Indian pan-piper, and you're expecting him to just stab him. A journey into the dark heart of the forest and man's soul alike."

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,the scope of this film is staggering.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"l'esthétique de Werner Herzog + le talent Klaus Kinski + la qualité de la BO (par le groupe new wave allemand Popol Vuh) = un film absolument inoubliable, le plus beau de Herzog je pense"
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,a perfect portrait of insanity. great cinematography and spectacular acting. popol vuh fits so perfectly as the composer. just the right amount of subtlety and a minimalist plot means this goes on the list of my favorite films.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,This movie's DVD animated menu nearly drove me insane.  I enjoyed the hell out of the movie as well
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Brilliant! Der sker ikke en skid bortset fra det der sker inde i Aguirres hoved og det er wonderful.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,One of Herzog's best
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"I was lost in the madness that is Kinski's character's mind, and I loved it."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Anybody interested in the darker side of life should see this movie, even ifonly for the fantastic ending. You can sense the insanity flowing out of Klaus Kinski as the madman Aguirre, and make no mistake, Klaus Kinski is crazy too, along with Werner Herzog himself."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Herzog crafted an absolute gem here: one of the most visually stunning films of all time, the sound editing is tense and brings on a sense of dread and DOOM. Klaus Kinski is fantastic here, it's impossible to look away from his eyes when he faces the camera."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"it probably has the best opening ever... and the best final scene ever too, besides monkeys!"
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,A great film! You can definitely see how it influenced Apocalypse Now and also Terrence Malik's The New World. It is amazing how well it has stood the test of time.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Klaus Kinski is fantastic!
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Klaus Kinski is pretty much a GOD in this movie. Herzog's best and one of Klaus Kinski's finest performances as the vicious and maniacal Don Lope de Aguirre. As we follow his doomed expedition through the jungle and his descent into madness, you can't help but feel drawn into the haunting story."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Klaus Kinski at his insane best - Check him out in Fitzcaraldo as well.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Crazy, with a huge side dish of more crazy. I can say with absolute confidence that this is the greatest film ever made."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,The cannon is rusty!
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,I'm not exactly sure what this movie means. It is a suggestion of humanity maybe.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Sort of a biopic of a great but slightly flawed man. Walk the Line meets Dances with Wolves.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Kinski is a monster!
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Puts you into a trance - Herzog at his rawest.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Werner Herzog, Klaus Kinski, no special effects and an amazing ambient soundtrack by Popol Vuh make this a film worth watching. 5 stars."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Do not see if you live in the Amazon!
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Definitely a favourite.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Or, why Kinski IS god."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"one of my favorites... eerie, terrifying and insane"

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Exquisitely filmed, acted, and characterised. Herzog strikes cinematic gold in this excellent film."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"La percezione della natura immensa e sovrastante e il modo con cui lo spettatore penetra nel paesaggio rendono questo film davvero affascinante.Il viaggio condotto da Aguirre è un viaggio verso l'inferno, l'influenza di questo film su Apocalipse now è massima..da vedere"
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"madness, death and the jungle in a herzog-kinski film. pretty much a formula for greatness."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Screwed up and dark, dark dark..."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Herzog's masterpiece featuring the best bit of acting Kinski ever did.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Hypnotic and spellbinding, borrowing from Conrad's Heart of Darkness, this is a magnificent film."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"When I watch this film I feel the desperation of the way the coquistadors lived. It was tough in the 16th century. The languid pace, the sense of being there with them and the stunning soundtrack by Popol Vuh combine to show us a vivid beauty. Kinski has as hypnotic a face as I have seen."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Amazing, so amazing. Kinski's footwork is just so key. His quest just condemns everyone around him, including himself. Just so so so good."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Herzog and Kinski FTW
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"aie aie aie, kinsky before nicholson in a crazy acting phenomenal"

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,This movie is simply amazing. The logistics of shooting it are mind boggling in themselves. The story itself is remarkable and haunting; it will stay in your mind for a long time.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,One of my favorite movie endings.  Herzog / Kinski at their best.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,European colonialists go mad in the jungles of South America in maniacal pursuit of gold. Very engaging stuff and a fine allegory for politics as we experience them today. Herzog is a seriously Great Director.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Madness. Ambition. Conquest.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"When Kinski looks into the camera and says ""Iam the wrath of God"" I started praying"
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,mad as a bunch of hatterssorry conquistadors.....
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Great Herzog film depicting a greed induced descent into madness. Very effective use of Popol Vuh's music. Favorite scene was at the very end with the camera panning around the raft and Aguirre's remaining subjects.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,the most beautiiful anti capitalist piece of art ever made (exept of 9/11) or just a interesting historical story. or if you like little monkeys dancing..
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Sinking into madness and despair, Kinski gives one of his top performances showing the destructive effects of greed and ambition, and, in effect, blasphemy. A movie about the unravelling of man in the horror of nature and fate, Conrad and Golding are beautifully evoked."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Here is a movie I heard was good before ever seeing it. Upon seeing it, I wasn't prepared to how good it was going to actually be. I'm going to have to watch it again. And soon."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,solid. Herzog never takes any shortcuts and it shows. I don't particularly care for rainforest movies but this one is so irreproachable it gets the coveted five stars gratis.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Oh Werner Herzog! Oh Klaus Kinski! Oh beauty on the screen!
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,it's all about the guy playing the pan flute. sweet.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Absolute deliria, great improvisation, very big movie and...Klaus Kinski. Nobody does movies like Herzog."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Great example of artistic restraint...allowing the story to 'tell itself'. Never seen a movie where the location was such a ""character"". There is no other film like this....except maybe Fitzcaraldo! :-)"
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Great herzog/ kinski collaboration, my favourite of theirs and especially enjoyable when you read the stories of how badly the two fought during filming."

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"I give it five for describing desperation and nightmarish, never ending conquest...but it's so depressing, I won't watch it again..."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"I completely fell in love with this film the first time I saw it. There is a subtle beauty in the raw images and Kinski's performance is gigantic. It is probably the most unforgettable film I've ever seen, an absolute masterpiece from the great Werner Herzog."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Stunning masterpiece from Werner Herzog. Klaus Kinski is brilliantly insane in the lead role.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,A brilliant film on every level if you can see past the likes of Independence Day. If you like psychotic germans playing psychotic spaniards in a rainforest then this is the film for you.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Herzog & Klaus Kinski at their finest.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Documentary realism meets dream-like surrealism in this masterpiece by the inimitable Werner Herzog. A rogue conquistador hijacks an expedition to El Dorado and leads it to its doom. Crazy man Kinski gives the performance of his career as the megalomaniac Aguirre.

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Between the history of this film and its making, Kinski's brilliant/psychotic performance as a madman (...as himself, perchance?), and Herzog's beautiful direction, Aguirre is a masterpiece."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Herzog, Kinski, a pygmy sloth, and a marmoset getting hurled off of a raft. One of the greatest movies of all time."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Lo que hace el ego y el afan de poder, parte I"

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Very powerful movie. Excellent scenery and camera. A story about conquistadors. Main theme - blind faith does not prove anyone right. Great example of how illusions bring dangers
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Severely creepy. Dare I say haunting? Yeah. Yeah, Iâ??ll dare that statement. This movie is haunting. Herzogâ??s best. And Kinskiâ??s. And cinemas...Al right. Not the latter, but I LOVE this movie. I mean. You gotta love that last scene. The one with the monkeys."

1.0,8-12,"It's a seminal work of interwoven dreams that is so seamlessly put together the audience often has trouble deciding what is relatity, and what is not. For most movies, this would prove disastrous. But for 8 1/2, it's a factor that is critical in the film's success."

1.0,8-12,A true masterpiece. Wonderfully surreal sequences.
1.0,8-12,The best italian film in 60's
1.0,8-12,"A movie that ventures into the deepest and darkest sentiments of a filmmaker in a humourous way. With felliniesque visuals, disconnected scenes and superfluous symbolism, the whole is even more magical than the sum of its parts in a square root. It comes to an 8 1/2."
1.0,8-12,"Not my favorite, but probably the best movie about filmmaking ever made."
1.0,8-12,Fellini's dreams and reality of the cinema put onto film is perfection. Features an incredible performance by Marcello Mastroianni as the pivotal character embodying an artist at the peak of their career. One of the great films about directing films.

1.0,8-12,"Easily one of the best films about filmmaking, if not, the best."
1.0,8-12,Fellini's brilliant beginning of what is known for his genius in the film industry. The movie leaves you confused and at the same time full of thought. It's not a movie you will watch over and over again but it will blow your fucken mind.

1.0,8-12,"Like La Dolce Vita, but more introspective, this film is still a relevant statement about fame and celebrity."
1.0,8-12,"An autobiographical tour-de-force of directorâ??s block, misogyny and Catholicism. One of most unique, best looking and craziest films ever made. This universally regarded masterpiece pre-dated the work of Kauffman by decades but demonstrates similar themes and ideas."

1.0,8-12,Amazing Movie .. really a great unique masterpiece...
0.0,8-12,"Uninspired, self-indulgent and overrated. I hate it. The worst movie ever made. And you probably wouldn't even believe me if I told you why."
1.0,8-12,"Not only one of Fredrico Fellini's best movies, but easily the best film ever made about the film industry. Every single frame is a beautiful work of art."
1.0,8-12,Una obra maestra!...
1.0,8-12,"con la hermosa fotografÃ­a de Gianni di Venanzo y un extraordinario Marcello Mastroianni, Federico Fellini logra una cinta soberbia, honesta y muy personal; me gustÃ³ mucho la escena de inicio, el diÃ¡logo con Claudia Cardinale y, por supuesto, los flash-backs a la infancia de Guido..."
1.0,8-12,"A fascinating insight into the creative mind and the demands, justifications and obligations to talent and inspiration."
1.0,8-12,Fellini's self-refferential masterpiece give the cinema its Hamlet.

0.0,8-12,"This is gonna sound like heresy since this is supposed to be ""one of the best movies of all time"", but I did not like this ""classic"" at all. Pretentious artsy fartsy crap."
1.0,8-12,"what's the feeling, when you were happy with guilty?"
1.0,8-12,"Beautifully crafted and totally confusing. Guaranteed to leave your head spining. Some of the most striking and memorable moments in cinema history."" Enough of symbolism and these escapist themes of purity and innocence"" absolute genius!"
1.0,8-12,I cannot do this movie justice with words.
1.0,8-12,Semi-autobiographical masterpiece
1.0,8-12,As good as everybody says it is.
1.0,8-12,(ITALY 1963 -Federico Fellini-)
1.0,8-12,One of the ten finest films ever made.
1.0,8-12,"A unique Fellini picture with a stunning cast about a confused, frustrated artist. Incredibly personal and realistic, this is Italian cinema at its best."
1.0,8-12,Amazing movie. Was great even with all the wonderful things I'd heard about it. I was not disappointed.
1.0,8-12,Fellini speaks the language of intellectual cinema and whether we really need the system of it when we ourselves are hypocritical in all senses of life.
1.0,8-12,Fellini's masterpiece
1.0,8-12,I'm going to need to give it a second viewing. There's so much going on in this movie. Loved it though.

1.0,8-12,todos deberÃ­an tener la oportunidad de ver esta pelÃ­cula
1.0,8-12,"A cinematic masterpiece. Fellini is a genius, for making such a legendary movie about a guy who can't make a movie. This is an instant favorite."
1.0,8-12,Wow... wow... wow...O_O
1.0,8-12,"I can tell that this is a movie that is going to get richer with every repeat viewing. Capturing the anxieties of the filmmaking process, Fellini has made one of the most bizarre and interesting stories about the creation of art."
1.0,8-12,The harem scene is a beautiful film classic!
1.0,8-12,My little 2 cents wont make much of a differece how briliant this film is.
1.0,8-12,"The perfect film. Full of beautiful women, sharp lighting, gorgeous shots and fragile humanity."
1.0,8-12,"Completely engrossing and beautiful story. Great script. Acting is very well done.Fellini sure knew how to pick his women.Awesome movie, watch!!"
1.0,8-12,The greatest work of art about the pressures of the artist regarding works of art
1.0,8-12,"I don't really like Fellini, but this, and La Strada, surprised me; 100% engrossing and brilliantly realized."
1.0,8-12,its absurdity was spectacular!
1.0,8-12,Larger-than-life ideas spawn what many consider is one of the best movies ever made. This inspired many other great movies. May be the king of all Italian movies.

1.0,8-12,"Una pelicula sobre una pelicula o sobre la vida misma. Las mujeres jamas entenderan cual es la esencia de esta pelicula que brota testosterona por todas partes, acerca del bloqueo masculino, la frustracion masculina y la ensonacion masculina en todos los sentidos posibles de estos conceptos."
1.0,8-12,What a masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,8-12,"In Fellini's own words, ""Beautifully confused""."
1.0,8-12,It was maybe the most important movie for me in studying moviescience! I remember the lecture on italian film and the sequences from otto e mezzo. It was something special I had never seen before ... So I did my thesis about Fellini ...
1.0,8-12,Such a beautiful film. A perfect entrance to Fellini's extraordinary career.
1.0,8-12,"Very well directed, great cinematography, and Guido is a great character; he's very sympathetic, well acted, and has the coolest glasses and sunglasses around"
1.0,8-12,"A masterpiece in ways I can't describe, but must see again soon in order to elaborate upon."
1.0,8-12,"Intense, mind-engaging and deeply personal depiction of what it takes to be a filmmaker. I watch this film every time I have problems with creativity."
1.0,8-12,Another Top Ten Favourite for me. Marcello Mastroianni was the Italian character actor with all the flawless charisma and technique of Cary Grant. Fellini is genius- period. And this film is the smoothest of Fellini's surreal landscapes with the most emotional bumps.
1.0,8-12,If you have not seen this then you do not know film.I've seen it on my birthday and it just shattered everything i thought i knew about filmmaking or storytelling. Its a masterpiece
1.0,8-12,The rare occurrence when a film lives up to the years of expectation heaped upon its shoulders is something to remember. What can I add that has not already been said about this film? It is magnificent. It also features the most beautiful cast of women I have ever seen.

1.0,8-12,Awesome writing. The pinnacle of avant-garde filmmaking.
1.0,8-12,"The greatest fantasy in the history of film. It's also a vey mystical film because it speaks directly to my sub-conscious. And also, one can just relax and wallow in the fun of it."
1.0,8-12,"trippiest movie ever made? perhaps not, but for the mainstream viewer, yes, yes it is."
1.0,8-12,One of greatest movies I have ever seen!
1.0,8-12,Way back when...upon watching the first five minutes I finally realized someone else saw life the same way I did. Took my breath away.
1.0,8-12,Another flawless classic from Fellini. A lot of the deeper allegories were lost on me but the film is genuinely fun to watch and skillfully paced.

1.0,8-12,So tasty tasty tasty movie....
1.0,8-12,Like Shakespeare...watch it twice to get it once.
1.0,8-12,A foreign film for people who don't like foreign films. Art doesn't get any better or more breathtaking than this.
1.0,8-12,How can you go wrong with a protagonist named Guido?
1.0,8-12,"Not for everyone. First time I saw it I didn't understand it, but the film looked beautiful. But after rewatching it and take the time to really absorb it, you'll be rewarded for its endless creativity and thoughtful examination of humanity."
1.0,8-12,Fellini balances playful and dramatic storytelling without one compromising the other. Throw in Mastroianni and Cardinale and you got one beautiful film.
1.0,8-12,One of the moust inspirational movies I have ever seen.
1.0,8-12,"The most brilliant autobiographical work in film. Reflective, poetic, a showcase of Fellini's art and wizardry. Mastroianni is perfect in alter-ego performance."
1.0,8-12,Lives up to its reputation
1.0,8-12,**Fellini s masterpiece** the man who cant love...
1.0,8-12,Brilliant and crazy film about a director trying to reconcile his life. Images really jump out at you in this one.
1.0,8-12,Fellini... sei sempre il megliore
1.0,8-12,Outstanding film. Really hypnotic & fascinating.
1.0,8-12,"the greatest italian film? It is quite possible. The story itself is nothing great but it is the depth of each of the characters, along with some of cinema's most memorable shots that make this truly great."
1.0,8-12,"This film is highly poetic in its presentation, emitting the same degree of intensity as any of James Joyce's best writings. A must-watch."
1.0,8-12,"I swear, this film is what is inside my head, more than any other movie I've ever seen.  In my opinion, this is Fellini's best (although La Dolce Vita is a very close second), and this is hands-down Mastroianni's best performance."
1.0,8-12,"what an amazing journey into the middle-aged man's psyche...but if you watch it with the sound off, the visuals are purely breath-taking (even Fellini played with the idea in the opening scene, so why not?)...a cinematic treasure!"
1.0,8-12,A must see for anyone who needs inspiration by something completely visually stimulating.
1.0,8-12,Truly a miraulus masterpiece. A director who just couldn't figure out what to do with his movie makes a movie about a director who doesn't know what to do with his movie. This is a must see for any type of moviegoer.
1.0,8-12,"I didn't catch it all in the first viewing, but a very subtle film about love, life, and family. The main character is very rich in layers as he goes through his life."
1.0,8-12,i've been watching this movie for as long as i can remember and i never try to analyze it but rather just feel it as it unfolds. fellini is like no other and has always kept me guessing. mesmerizing
1.0,8-12,"A ravishing compendium of sights, sounds, and performances in a film that has the great Federico Fellini turn creative block into transcendent art. Not to be ignored."

1.0,8-12,Don't think I will ever finish this movie... absolutly fantastic!!
1.0,8-12,"I agree with Ebert. Film is about images. If all you want is story, go read a book. If you feel the same way, then this is a masterpiece."
1.0,8-12,"Sure, I may be a Fellini junkie, but I never get tired of this flick. Just the way the camera moves through this story is dreamy. Quite a journey!"
1.0,8-12,Fellini was a ridiculously good director and this is a ridiculously good film. I can only think of a couple that I like better than this one. Easily one of the greatest ever made.
1.0,8-12,"Ultimately, this is a really funny movie. It's obvious from a lot of the reviews here that many people don't know a comedy when they see one."
1.0,8-12,This is such a cool movie in so many ways.
1.0,8-12,Si esta no es la mejor pelicua de la historia pega en el palo.La genialidad de Fellini en su maxima expresion.Si de verdad les gusta el cine estan obligados a ver este film y las demas joyas de Federico.
1.0,8-12,"Mental opening, the best ever portrayal of a dream I've ever seen. Great."
1.0,8-12,"A masterpiece of all time, no more words. Strong charachters and Fellini's ability to ride us to a thick border between reality and fantasy. I finally understood the strong influences with T. Gilliam's Brazil."

1.0,8-12,This is possibly one of the greatest movies of all time
1.0,8-12,"By blurring the lines between dreams, memories, and the present, Fellini produces the most accurate reproduction of the experience of life ever to be captured on film. If you've ever wondered what it's like to have other people call you an artist, this film will let you live it."
1.0,8-12,The opening scene...wow. It sets a great symbol for the rest of the film. I love how the transitions between reality and surrealism become less and less clear as the film progresses.
1.0,open_city,"A great movie from back when fighting Nazis, not joining them, was considered the most patriotic thing you could do."

1.0,open_city,ANNA Magnani my myth
1.0,open_city,"A classic neo-realist film, where Rossellini examines issues of humanity in the devastated surroundings of German occupied Rome."
1.0,open_city,"A masterpiece of the Itallian neorealist movement. Hugely contraversial, it's a shocking and moving look at the fall of an Italian resistance group during WWII."
1.0,open_city,I'll take this over the Bicycle Thief any day of the week
1.0,open_city,Classic drama about people resisting their new fascist rulers.
1.0,open_city,"A great early Italian Neo-Realism film, a must see."
1.0,open_city,"Unusually tight plotting for a neorealist film, though just as moving."
1.0,open_city,Open City is unquestionably one of the strongest dramatic films yet made about the recent war. And the fact that it was hurriedly put together by a group of artists soon after the liberation of Rome is significant of its fervor and doubtless integrity
1.0,open_city,"""We mustn't be afraid now or in the future,"" says Francesco, ""because we are on the just path."" Loaded with the kind of raw power that sneaks up on you and slaps you in the face, Rome Open City is totally devastating and immediate, a masterpiece of the post-war Italian realism movement."
1.0,open_city,"Desgarradora a mas no poder, esta triste historia sobre la guerra se clava en el corazon y llega hasta las visceras. Profundamente humana, profundamente italiana."
1.0,open_city,"The film to pronounce Italian Neo-Realism. Thousands of films owe THIS film for taking us out of the studios and into film truth.""Rossellini turned defects into virtues. He willingly sacrificed polish for reality, [sets] for real locations, fiction for life."" Gerald Mast"
1.0,open_city,A brilliant tale of defiance told through an intimate setting and group of characters.
1.0,open_city,Classic. Very moving scene when the priest gets shot by firing squad as the kids look on from behind the fence.....
1.0,open_city,"Shot on captured Nazi film stock, Rossellini pulls people off the recently liberated streets of Rome to film this gem. Brilliant!"
1.0,open_city,An excellent film about the german occupation of Italy. Its unbelieveable that this film was shot in 1946 during which some of Italy was still being liberated. The performances are great and Rossellinis very subtle style is perfect for the subject matter. An incredibly important film.
1.0,open_city,one of my favourite movies
1.0,open_city,"Rossellini's unforgettable film about Rome under Nazi occupation. Incredible, moving performance by Anna Magnani!"
1.0,open_city,Rossellini's best!!!

1.0,open_city,Masterpiece of neorealism from Roberto Rossellini!
0.0,open_city,I really dislike Neorealism.
1.0,open_city,"Another hallmark of Italian Neorealism. About the Resistance to Nazi Occupation, filmed while IT WAS HAPPENING. Incredible performances. Inspiring story. A priest as a hero, wow, that's something we haven't seen of late! Slow for the modern moviegoer, don't see it late."
1.0,open_city,Try and get the Criterion Collection version as there is VERY interesting commentary on this film that portrays how a country can get on again after (what is basically) a civil war.
1.0,open_city,Anna Magnani is the heart of the movie in this key film of the neorealistic period.
1.0,open_city,"Between a corridor, through which Anna Magnani, lays a hall. This intermediary room lingers, she follows through the street; the camera being followed as it films with the point of view of a nazi soldier.She runs towards the camera. The camera kills her."
1.0,open_city,My favorite movie ever!
1.0,open_city,Que final! Lagrimones en los ojos cada vez que lo veo.
1.0,open_city,"One of the main references of the italian neorealism, Rossellini makes an extraordinary film about the horror of the war. Compelling, beautifil and very raw at the same time."
1.0,open_city,"obvioulsly anna magnani is a force of nature, my god."
1.0,open_city,NeoRealism? I think it's boss. Rosselini knows what he is doing.
1.0,open_city,Gracias Rossellini!!!!
1.0,open_city,"tanto vero, tanto commovente.."
1.0,open_city,OMG! I couldn't understand a damn thing they were saying. It's in like Spanish or something.
1.0,open_city,A timeless film about WWII Rome and the way people can react to extreme circumstaces.
1.0,open_city,"Brilliant film about the Italian resistance during the second world war, and moral courage and decay under the most horrifying of circumstances. An early masterpiece of the Italian neo-realist movement. The gunfire heard in the background is actual sounds of Germans killing Roman citizens."
1.0,open_city,just amazing. this movie goes directly to my hearth.
1.0,open_city,italian neorealism. tough women. great.
1.0,open_city,one of those must see classics that havent aged one bit

1.0,open_city,"""It's not difficult to die well. The difficult thing is to live right."" The first Italian Neorealit film that set in motion many other powerful films."
1.0,open_city,"I really loved this. It was such a dark film, but it was uplifting at the same time with its portrayal of the strength of the human spirit."
1.0,open_city,One of my favorite Italian neo-realist films.
1.0,open_city,"I really loved this film. It was moving, and a fascinating look at Rome in this period (also suggested: ""The Bicycle Thief"")."
1.0,open_city,Italian neo-realism is an amazing genre of movies. Anyone who loves film should watch this movie.
1.0,open_city,classic italian neo realist film. a very gripping and hard hitting story about life in rome during world war 2. the camear work adds a very documentary style feel to it and some of the death scenes of key characters are very moving.
1.0,open_city,"Probablement mon film néoréaliste préféré. Brutal, mais joué de façon splendide. Anna Magnani y est... magnanime! (Elle porte bien son nom!!).***One of my favorite neorealist movie..."

1.0,1058966-red,Few films have reached this level of artistry.
1.0,1058966-red,Th cinematography and camera angles used were very intriguing and the use of color was interesting. The color red was used to signify the important characters in the movie and to highlight important things.What a great movie and what a lovely actress. Very cute and charming.
1.0,1058966-red,Wonderful movie. Beautiful lead actress. In the UK it is called Three Colours Red. Isabel Jacob was awesome. Looks at profound subjects.
1.0,1058966-red,"Perhaps the most philosophically dense film ever made. Most of Kieslowski's films seem like puzzles to me, meant to expand mind and soul."
1.0,1058966-red,"Kieslowski and his muse Irene Jacob made some of the most beautiful, thought-provoking art in the 1990s. This one deals with voyeurism, guilt, love, and of course, fate."
1.0,1058966-red,"The way several people's lives all run parallel and intersect at one point or another is incredibly realistic and believable thanks to outstanding performances. The film is truly touching and extremely emotional, the trilogy as a whole is something really special."

1.0,1058966-red,A magnificent conclusion to the Three Colors trilogy. Definitely the best of the three.
1.0,1058966-red,"simply perfect.the finest movie of all time, in my view :)"
1.0,1058966-red,"The best part of ""the trilogy three colors"". So beautiful and amazing."
1.0,1058966-red,"A wonderful portrait of humanity, following the lines of ""Blanc"" and ""Bleu"". A very excellent tie-up of the trilogy, although I would definitely put Blue and Red on par as amazing works of art. Perhaps people can change after all...given time"
1.0,1058966-red,"Awesome movie. Very symbolic, emotional, and compelling."
1.0,1058966-red,"The best of the trilogy, Three Colours: Red is a deeply-written masterwork that succeeds in its approach as it is a fully-realised and compelling recreation of Kieslowski's message."
1.0,1058966-red,"This is definitely my favorite of the trilogy. It's not as outright depressing as Bleu and not as Quirky as White. It strikes the perfect balance of heart, humor and drama in an expertly constructed masterwork. The way every trilogy should end."
1.0,1058966-red,"An excellent movie - beautiful, exquisite photograph, masterful directing, and excellent acting. Some of the filming is the best I've ever seen in a movie. In addition, the characters are great and the pacing of the story is pretty much perfect. It's a beautiful story. Great movie."
1.0,1058966-red,"quite simply perfect, a masterpiece"
1.0,1058966-red,The finest of Kieslowski's Three Colors trilogy.
1.0,1058966-red,I fell in love with Irene Jacob watching this movie and went to Geneva when I studied abroad just so I could see the city in the movie. A great movie that hits its mark and touches real emotions.
1.0,1058966-red,A highly ambitious finale to one of the great imaginative trilogies ever made.
1.0,1058966-red,"Easily the MASTERPIECE of the bunch. A perfect conclusion to a powerhouse trilogy. One feels that he has conquered the world of cinema after seeing this film. A unique and profound experience. Thank you, Kieslowski."

1.0,1058966-red,Perfect. My favourite movie of all time. Beautiful.
1.0,1058966-red,A masterpiece. Flawless. I cannot express the awe: my mouth is still open.
1.0,1058966-red,"This is a masterful conclusion to the Three Colors trilogy. Beautifully crafted in every way, Red features one of the most satisfying and thought provoking endings in a film I have ever seen. What an accomplishment."
1.0,1058966-red,"Maybe the strongest film of the three, ""Red"" is a deeply philosophical exploration of chance and the inter-connectivity of life. It's searching ideas, stirring beauty, and almost humble formal virtuosity present a director at the zenith of his powers and thematic concerns."

1.0,1058966-red,A great finish to a great trilogy!
1.0,1058966-red,"Wonderful, beautiful, and engrossing. This film does no wrong."
1.0,1058966-red,Liberty! Equality! Fraternity! Recently saw the trilogy again. Found Fraternity (Rouge) to be the most compelling in today's context. A decade ago my choice was Equality (Blanc) or getting even! Maybe will take some more time to fully comprehend the value of Liberty (Bleu).
1.0,1058966-red,One of my favorite movies by Polish director Kieslowski
1.0,1058966-red,"Absolutely amazing film, the best of the three and with enough stuff in it to keep you thinking for a long time afterwards."
1.0,1058966-red,"One of the director's best (sadly his last), a touching, unsentimental but hopeful film about disconnected people who find a connection a very unlikely situation. Irene Jacob has some of the best eyes in modern movies, and Trintignant is masterfully subtle. And that opening!"
1.0,1058966-red,Definitivamente o melhor da trilogia das cores.

1.0,1058966-red,"Para mí la más hermosa de las tres, una nostálgica mirada a la inocencia, la soledad y la esperanza en el destino. D.R."

1.0,1058966-red,Favorite one out of 3 Kieslowski's masterpieces
1.0,1058966-red,"What an accomplishment. Visually breathtaking and gloriously contemplative, and an ending as astonishing, if not moreso, as the two colors that came before it. Subtle."
1.0,1058966-red,C'est le destin et le hasard les themes principaux du film ou il y a beaucoup de paralleles entre differents personnes qui se rencontrent a la fin. C'est un film magnifique.
1.0,1058966-red,will watch it again for sure
1.0,1058966-red,and 5 stars is not enough...red is the best...and this is the best trilogy ever..THANK YOU KIESLOWSKI !
1.0,1058966-red,Nothing much can be said here because words are not sufficient enough. I'm so glad that Kieslowski's last film was also his masterpiece!! It was also the perfect ending to the Trilogy.
1.0,1058966-red,Perhaps my all-time favorite. Blew me away.
1.0,1058966-red,Maybe the best movie in one of the greatest trilogies of all time.
1.0,1058966-red,it was nice how all the films fell in together at the end.

1.0,1058966-red,"for all those who wonder bout the word ""LOVE"" and those who thinks they know about it all. here is an insight to it painted by Krzysztof Kieslowski ."
1.0,1058966-red,Great writing/directing/acting. kept my interest throughout and had me thinking a lot about what was happening. Anytime a movie shows me something new or different its gonna rate high and this did. I think anyone can enjoy this.
1.0,1058966-red,"Loved all three, but I think blue is the most striking.It's also sad that the director passed away 2 years after making his last film."
1.0,1058966-red,äººç??ç??å·§å??å?¯ä»¥æ??å¹¾å·§å??.......
1.0,1058966-red,"Best amongst the trilogy. Intense. All in all, Colors trilogy is a must watch! Kieslowski deserved an Oscar (IMO) I'm gonna watch it all over again, undoubtedly."
1.0,1058966-red,We watched all three of Three Colors series. All three were five star movies. Kieslowski was a master. Red was my favorite. I'm glad my memory is bad because I can watch these old classics like it was the first time. They are beautiful. If you haven't seen them put them in your queue..
1.0,1058966-red,"Of the ""Trois couleurs"" films by Krzystof Kieslowski, my favorite is ""Red.' It probably has a lot to do with the great performance by Irene Jacob. The movie is so compelling, she is mesmerizing on the screen."
1.0,1058966-red,The last half-hour of this movie gave me more or less constant chills.
1.0,1058966-red,la mejor pelicula...
1.0,1058966-red,How do you medicate your loneliness?
1.0,1058966-red,"One of my favorites alongside Bleu. This is a a grownup movie, so no kiddies please."
1.0,1058966-red,"Meu preferido do Kieslowski.Ótimo roteiro, original e interessantíssimo."
1.0,1058966-red,"Everyone owns his/her little secrets. But then, everyone hides what isn't right? Not thinking in terms of consequences, but in terms of what's right to be done - this is the great thing about the end of this trilogy. Also, it is nice to see how all the pieces blend together in the end... A must see."
1.0,1058966-red,"bleu: libertad,blanc: igualdad,rouge: fraternidad."
1.0,1058966-red,"God I love this film; beautiful, simply beautiful. There is such elegance and sensuality to these three films, and in some ways it's difficult to understand what it is that makes me love them so much; rather like a great painting, I just love it, without necessarily understanding it fully."
1.0,1058966-red,Definitivamente o melhor da trilogia das cores.
1.0,1058966-red,"Brotherhood is the theme of Kieslowski's last film, and closing piece of the Three Colours Trilogy, which features a particularly extraordinary finale."
1.0,1058966-red,The concluding chapter in Kieslowski's Three Colors triology is the best. Provocative and spinning from beginning to end. A fine farewell for one of Europe's most revered film directors.
1.0,1058966-red,"Focusing on the idea of human bonding, the film contains the most beautiful cinematography compared to Blue and White. The core strength of the film lies in the fascinating interaction between the two leads. Blue and White are great, but Red is fantastic. A great end to the trilogy."
1.0,1058966-red,and Fraternity. Genius.
1.0,1058966-red,"Si BLEU es fuerza y drama, ROUGE es pasión y misterio. Irene Jacob adorable y sensacional como Valentine. Esta película me recuerda mucho aquel cuento de Jorge Luis Borges llamado ""El Otro""... Otra joyita del gran Krxyustof Kieslowski. Memorable!"
1.0,1058966-red,"Beautiful, fantastic end to a fantastic trilogy...best of the three. Doesn't try to be too clever, just does what it does, and weaves its magical tale until the viewer becomes immersed."
1.0,1058966-red,Fraternity is what keeps us sane.
1.0,1058966-red,"wonderful! way better than ""White."" Most American's will not get the point of the movie though."
1.0,1058966-red,"An absolute must-see. Possibly, one of the all times masterpieces."
1.0,1058966-red,Toda a trilogia é excepcional e merece 5 estrelas. Mas assim fica mais claro qual foi o que mais me impressionou.
1.0,1058966-red,"Wonderful conclusion to the Trois Couleurs trilogy. Irene Jacob is brilliant and Kieslowski is at his best; Red is far more accessible than Blue. Tragically, this was his last film."
1.0,1058966-red,Foreign Films are great
1.0,1058966-red,"De la trilogia de colores, esta es la favorita de los criticos (yo personalmente, me quedo con blanco). Sin embargo, esta pelicula poco a poco va penetrando el alma de la mujer de una manera que muy pocas obras cinematograficas se han atrevido (o lo han logrado)."
1.0,1058966-red,Aunque en esta estÃ¡ Irene Jacob
1.0,1058966-red,"Our lives are strings of pearls and stones. When the strings are looped by time and experience, the juxtaposition of good and bad, history and future is often painfully sweet."
1.0,1058966-red,Ce film reste Ã  mes yeux le meilleur de Kieslowski qui va Ã  travers sa camÃ©ra faire ressortir la profondeur de l'Ã¢me humaine. Ã? noter les personnages jouÃ©s par IrÃ¨ne Jacob et Jean-Louis Trintignant ainsi que la photo de ce film: un pure dÃ©lice pour les yeux et pour l'esprit !
1.0,1058966-red,Must see for anyone serious about film or art.

1.0,1058966-red,The three separate storylines worked brilliantly and the beautiful use of red in all the appropriate places seemed perfect. The ending came as a shock.
1.0,1058966-red,"KieÅ?lowski's magnum opus. The greatest film EVER, I doubt anything will scrape thisas far as I'm concerned, on every viewing I see a little more of the genius that was Krzysztof KieÅ?lowski.

1.0,1058966-red,The Trois couleurs trilogy really is great. This is extremely dense genius film-making at its best.
1.0,1058966-red,One of my all-time favorites. A kind of meditation on coincidences and larger patterns and the currents in people's lives that draw them together without their realizing it.
1.0,1058966-red,"Three Colors - my favorite films of all time. If you haven't seen them, you should."

1.0,1058966-red,"Beautiful, character-driven film that looks inside the soul of humankind and asks some very basic, but abstract questions. Not as good as Blue, but better than White. I liked the tie-up at the end."
1.0,1058966-red,"The best of the three ... and that's saying a lot. Plus there's Irene Jacob. And the runway scene. ""Etre""."
1.0,1058966-red,"magnificent example of how films should be made...real cinema as art. a truly breathtaking conclusion to the trilogy, not sure about rating them separately..."

1.0,1058966-red,"Kieslowski takes the concepts of fate, conscience, and brotherhood and weaves them into a unique and powerful story filled with gorgeous imagery. The end just always makes me marvel at his genius. Too bad we don't have more from him."

1.0,1058966-red,"To sum up the briiliance of Kieslowski's career, one needs only to watch this film. Kieslowski is a filmmaker of compassion and meditation. Not for anyone who doesn't go to the cinema to think."

1.0,1058966-red,Kieslowski is the master.
1.0,1058966-red,just one of those movies...!
1.0,1058966-red,"Best in the Trois Couleurs trilogy.  *On my ""best of the 1990s"" list."
1.0,1058966-red,"masterpiece; kieslowski's last is beautifully human; excellent acting, delicate performances"
1.0,1058966-red,"All three in this trilogy are Brilliant. Few movies can match the creativity, depth, and quality."
1.0,1058966-red,Great characterisation. So happy the series ended on such a strong note. Trois Couleurs is one of the best trilogies of films ever.
1.0,1058966-red,"c'est un film de la beaute et comment cette beaute vives au monde... Valentine est une femme-reve - tres geniale, tres fragile...."
1.0,1058966-red,"the finale of the greatest trilogy, ever.... ties together ""blue"" and ""white"", which were all filmed concurrently and are 5-star films on their own.... all 3 films are beautiful masterpieces in exploring the interaction between personalities and consequences of their actions...."
1.0,1058966-red,"Tal vez una de las mejores películas que he visto, sorprendente, cautivadora, un ritmo genial, a masterpiece!"
1.0,1058966-red,"You have to watch the entire trilogy for this to make complete sense, but it also stands up watched individually. I like this one the best of the three."
1.0,1058966-red,"Beatiful. Must see the three of them: Blue, White, Red"
1.0,1058966-red,"A beautiful movie in its own right, and also a deftly woven conclusion to the whole trilogy."
0.0,1058966-red,thats only fucking one color you dumb fucking bimbo
1.0,1058966-red,My favorite 'Three Colors' part. The two main characters are well written and the acting is amazingly subtle. One of those quiet movies that simple minds will never get. Everyone else should definitely check it out!
1.0,1058966-red,Part of a series. I loved this movie as much as Bleu. Irene Jacob is wonderful.
1.0,1058966-red,The best of the three films. It has wonderful images throughout. Must see again.
1.0,1058966-red,I love all Kieslowski but this one is the best
1.0,1058966-red,"Final sublime para la trilogia de Kieslowsi, con una reflexion sobre la forma en que se entrelazan los destinos de los seres humanos. Una pelicula cargada de simbolos, el mas bonito : la mirada de Valentine (Irene Jacob) en la toma final."
1.0,1058966-red,Kieslowski is a great Director and this is a perfect final film. Irene Jacob is outstanding and the film is pretty much flawless in every way. It's not essential to have seen 'blue' and 'white' first but the characters from the previous films do appear in 'Red'.
1.0,1058966-red,Amazing... an all time favourite. Must see White and Blue as well.
1.0,1058966-red,Paras kolmesta. Erittain tiivis ja kaunis elokuva kohtalosta. Irene Jacob hohtaa kuten myos melkein kaikki kuvat maagista valoa. Yksi parhaimmista nakemistani elokuvista.
1.0,1058966-red,One of my all time favorite films... a true masterpiece
1.0,1058966-red,"Last film in the 3 Colours Trilogy, with scenes from White and Blue cleverly cut in to bring everything together."
1.0,1058966-red,"The last and most mature film of the director. Scene setting and sctors are wonderful. The same meaning of ""Doulbe life of Veronique"" applies to the old & young judges."
1.0,1058966-red,le meilleur film chaque plan et un tableau
1.0,1058966-red,"watch all 3, but watch them in order. Superb"
1.0,1058966-red,The best movie i have ever seen!!!!
1.0,1058966-red,"Ravishing is the first word that comes to mind with Kieslowski's last effort, coupled with Irene Jacob's stunning looks & performance! ...and Jean-Louie Trintignant's still shines as a matinee idol in winter!"
1.0,1058966-red,This movie is incdredible! Such a wonderful movie about character development and friendship
1.0,1058966-red,"I know, all flixster (77%) didn't like it. But I like it. It is one of my favorite film for all time. It enlighten me through trilogies conclusion. I got the inner feeling of french revolution."
1.0,1058966-red,One of my favourite movies of all times. Irene Jacob is so stunningly beautiful and melancholic at the same time. The music is superb. The story captivates. Visually it is a feast of light. I really need to get it on Blue Ray to see it again.
0.0,1058966-red,ZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
1.0,1058966-red,a very simple and subtle story but yet so profound in so many ways...loved it to the core
1.0,1058966-red,This one ties the trilogy together with hope. I like that.
1.0,1058966-red,"Perhaps the least intoxicating of the trilogy, but my personal favorite. Deep."
1.0,1058966-red,A really great depiction of the interconnectivity and intraconnectivity of people's lives. I thoroughly enjoying the experience of watching this film. It enlightened me. It's a flawless film and a perfect way to end the trilogy.
1.0,1058966-red,"Slutet på triologin håller samma höga klass som början den blå). Perfekt i alla delar - musik, kamera, dialog - och speciellt tankeväckande för en gammal domare!"
1.0,1058966-red,Irene Jacob is beautiful in a way you can't see until the end of the movie. The details of Bleu (et Blanc) become clearer. Kieslowski is my favorite director because of this movie and how it crowns the prior two in this series. A good watch for a relaxing afternoon without distractions.
1.0,1058966-red,A masterful ending to this genuine work
1.0,1058966-red,the most surreal of the three...voyeuristic...verra noice.
1.0,1058966-red,Kieslowski ends the trilogy well.
1.0,1058966-red,A fitting ending to an excellent film trilogy. The ending left me completely speechless.
1.0,1058966-red,The best Kieslowski's movie
1.0,1058966-red,Kieslowski fills up my spiritual space that's been emptied for so long
1.0,1058966-red,"The only part of the trilogy that matters. People do not understand this movie. The musical score, cinematography, etc. are not what's important...what's so profound about that? watch it again, and focus on the theme"
1.0,1058966-red,"Emociones fuertes, con inocencia y alegria mezcladas con el destape de pasiones humanas menos nobles. Confianza en el futuro y amor a los demas Kieslowski es un maestro"
1.0,1058966-red,"The best film in the world! Amour, hasard, silences, emotions... et la couleur rouge!"
1.0,1058966-red,"It left me speechless! So powerful, so mysterious, so romantic (in the literal sense of the word) and achieves what I thought only literature can."
1.0,1058966-red,Will probably need a second viewing but rivals Blue as being one of the best of the trilogy!!!
1.0,1058966-red,I love Kieslowski so much. He is great.
1.0,1058966-red,One of the best movies i have seen in a long time
1.0,1058966-red,I fell in love with Irene Jacob watching this movie and went to Geneva when I studied abroad just so I could see the city in the movie. A great movie that hits its mark and touches real emotions.
1.0,1058966-red,"It plays on my senses but most of all touches my soul. But I will have to say that ""Blue"" is my favourite of this trilogy. All of them are remarkable."
1.0,1058966-red,Did not know that Krzysztof Kieslowski was directing two of 'Three Colours' at the same time!!!
1.0,1058966-red,Kieslowski pÃ¥ sitt beste! Helt pÃ¥ hÃ¸yde med Veronikas to liv (og det sier ganske mye)

1.0,1058966-red,My favorite of the three... Only wish I could write like this.
1.0,1058966-red,"""No flying from fate"""
1.0,1058966-red,ROUGE is definitely the best part of the Trois Couleurs trilogy. (And this is my favorite foreign movie.)
1.0,1058966-red,"Beautiful, quiet, and delicately rendered meditation on the mysteries and meaning of love."
1.0,1058966-red,"Pure Genius, no film has had a greater effect on me than this, Kieslowski is an unsung hero, the film is beautifully shot, wonderfully poetic and features a fantastic music score, this movie still sends tingles down my spine and i've seen it many times."
1.0,1058966-red,"Honestly, I've seen a lot of movies, & I think this is the greatest ever..."
1.0,1058966-red,The last of the three and the best...
1.0,1058966-red,Thoughly enjoyed it.
1.0,1058966-red,"Best in the trilogy. Blue and White are both very good, but Red definitely trumps them."
1.0,1058966-red,"Amongst the Three Colors, I like Rouge (Red) most. Maybe I believe Irene Jocob is the best actress for Kieslowski's Movies."
1.0,1058966-red,The most beautiful film making I have ever seen.
1.0,1058966-red,"""I feel something important is happening around me. And it scares me. """
1.0,1058966-red,C'est le destin et le hasard les themes principaux du film ou il y a beaucoup de paralleles entre differents personnes qui se rencontrent a la fin. C'est un film magnifique.
1.0,1058966-red,Another of Kieslowski's great films. Great music.
1.0,1058966-red,Kieslowski my favorite directors (of course he is polish - pardon he was). His movies are like poetry you are just reading them on big screen. 'Red' is my favorite one from the trilogy. To pity that he didn't finish his last project 'Heaven' i felt to lack him
1.0,1058966-red,"Think in details The memory , the crash."
1.0,1058966-red,One of my favorite movies. Third in a trio of movies.
1.0,1058966-red,"My fav color out of the Trois couleurs. But music wise, Bleu is the best."
1.0,1058966-red,The perfect finale to the trilogy.
1.0,1058966-red,This ranks amongst my all time favorite! I love the way color and emotions are intertwined in this trilogy. This is a touching story of how nothing is a coincidence in life and that there is a greater plan that we are all a part of.
1.0,1058966-red,"The one that brings it all, expertly, together - blessing some characters and granting them another chance. Not as good as Blue - but then few things are."
1.0,1058966-red,"it took me a while to figure out what was happening. but, this has got to be one of the most beautiful films"
1.0,1058966-red,Great cinematography. Simple but effective story. Subtle and beautiful.

1.0,1058966-red,Almost 14 years after first seeing this in Georgetown I still think it's one of the best films ever made. Reviewing it reprises one of the roles.
1.0,1058966-red,The greatest cinematic story about fate. The way everything wraps up is simply genius.
1.0,1058966-red,I totally agree with Gustavo (even tough I only understood Kieslowski is an genious...)

1.0,1058966-red,My favorite of the trilogy! Loved the way the ending ties all three together!
1.0,1058966-red,Love anything by Kieslowski. I cried the morning when they announced he died of a heart attack.

1.0,1058966-red,My second favourite foreign film ever after Hana-bi.
1.0,1058966-red,So Poetic and real in a sense!
1.0,1058966-red,"The world is getting smaller, yet the gap between people grow wider. This film captures the distance in between. In the end, we are all tragic beings on a boat destined to sink; one person's tragedy is everybody's tragedy."
1.0,1058966-red,My favourite of the trilogy.
1.0,1058966-red,"A film about loneliness and isolation and escaping it. So subtle, so real, but it has a happy ending!!!"
1.0,1058966-red,The best of the three.
1.0,1058966-red,"Watch Red, watch Blue, Watch White ... Kieslowski - absolutely vintage"
1.0,1058966-red,A complex and meticulous masterpiece.
1.0,1058966-red,My absolute favorite movie
1.0,1058966-red,My favorite of the Kieslowski trilogy... What if?
1.0,1058966-red,"this is one of those movies that i fell madly in love with when i was younger and sappier because i thought that it told me real, tangible truths about human interactions. I still really love it."
1.0,1058966-red,"Un homme et une femme, fin bref. Jean-Louis Trintignant collecte des pierres. Ce soir Ã  la tÃ©lÃ©"
1.0,1058966-red,The cut that Jacob has a pear brandy with Trintignant is one of the most beautiful scene I have ever seen.
1.0,1058966-red,"Powerful, unique relation between 2 characters; my favourite from the trilogy"
1.0,1058966-red,Kieslowski is the man.
1.0,1058966-red,The cinematography and framing of the shots is amongst the best of any film I've ever seen. Great story telling and one of my favorite films of all time.
1.0,1058966-red,The most accessible and warm installment of Kieslowski's Three Colors trilogy (after a little initial discomfort in a specific plot point surround Trintignant's creepy but compelling character as a disillusioned eavesdropping judge). Irene Jacob is RADIANT here.
1.0,1058966-red,A great piece of art. I like the way this is connected to the other colors. Music served the visuals amazingly well.
1.0,1058966-red,The best of the greatest trilogy of all times. Trintignant is astonishing. Pure Art.
1.0,1058966-red,eso si es una rara joya
1.0,1058966-red,Kieslowski was a genius--a word that many undeserving are attributed with; but not here--and this is his magnum opus.
1.0,1058966-red,"The best, the don't need more words"
1.0,1058966-red,"a wonderful end to the most beautiful trilogy ever made. Red is, as Roger Ebert says, the best amoung equals. It is the best, but they're all brilliant, watch them in order: Blue, White and Red (on favorites to represent trilogy, not individual film)"
1.0,1058966-red,Seen it a long time ago!
1.0,1058966-red,"This is one of the three films in an amazing trilogy. It's story is solid, but to me...unremarkable. However, the colors are absolutely brilliant. The cinematography is so singular and special."
1.0,1058966-red,"Part of the greatest sequence of films ever made. Bleu is the masterpiece but this is not far behind. Irene Jacob befriends an old judge, and they begin an unusual relationship."
1.0,1058966-red,Last of the trilogy and the best of the three in my opinion.
1.0,1058966-red,De las mejores pelÃ­culas que he visto.
1.0,1058966-red,"If you love movies, you should see this. Especially the cinematography."
1.0,1058966-red,well.. no words exist that would accurately describe this masterpiece

1.0,1058966-red,Beautifully stunning
1.0,1058966-red,"por una historia, que no esta en el film, pero es la principal"
1.0,1058966-red,"An amazing movie. Not only was the directing and acting wonderful, but the cinematography was beautiful. One of those cathartic movies that you can't help but cry during."
1.0,1058966-red,"Not as good as the blue, but still totally amazing."
1.0,1058966-red,"Georgous movie, visually stunning. In my Top 10 all time and one of my most viewed."
1.0,1058966-red,"Master storytelling, dealing with life, fate, and destiny. This is the film in which composition heavily reflects the film's themes and motifs."
1.0,1058966-red,"even though the entire trilogy is absolutely amazing, this one is the best one."
1.0,1058966-red,"I like it! my favorite one among ""three colors."" KK is amazing~~"
1.0,1058966-red,My favourite movie by far. Krzysztof Kieslowski's best film.
1.0,1058966-red,Good - a bit different
1.0,1058966-red,A lovely and delicate end to the trilogy that will fill your heart with hope... Simply stunning...
1.0,1058966-red,"the film that hooked me onto Kieslowski; stunning film about the beauty of friendship, between and old judge and valentine (a model); there is a parallel story that brings forth the circularity of life."
1.0,1058966-red,"i'm really impressed by krysztof's last film! perfect length an hour and a half, good storyline, human relationship well portrayed, cinemathique, ... what can i complain about? nothing at all !"
1.0,1058966-red,serinin uc filmi de ayri ayri tattalar. ortak gosterilen kahramanlar olaya ayri bir guzellik katmis. muzikler ve kurgu da mukemmel. en begendigim seri diyebilirim.

1.0,1058966-red,"i fall in love with Irene Jacob after i watch it, what a girl!! although u cant control destiny, but there's always hope!"
1.0,1058966-red,"This is a beautifully subtle love story, with mysterious and enigmatic superimposed human stories. The relationship between Valentine and the retired judge is extraordinarily moving."
1.0,1058966-red,"A retired judge... or God in the bench? Rita, a dog. The door is open. A judge hearing the phone convesations. Valentine has faith in the old judge. She can't see him, because of the lights of flashes, but she hear him. The judge in the bench. And then... fate or Providence?"
1.0,1058966-red,Tämä taitaa jäädä lopulliseksi suosikikseni trilogiasta.
1.0,1058966-red,I'm so totally in love with Valentine/Irène Jacob... I'm so totally amazed by the judge/Jean-Louis Trintignant... I'm so totally fond of Kieslowski's last period...
1.0,1058966-red,A movie that means a lot to me.
1.0,1058966-red,One of these movies that can' be surpassed
1.0,1058966-red,fucking magical. kieslowski is everything that kubrick wished he could be.
1.0,1058966-red,"Incredible! This is the most intelligent film I've ever seen. Subtle, emotional, mysterious, and thought-provoking. Definitely takes more than one watch to ""get it"" and makes movies like ""The Notebook"" look so stupid in comparison. A sublime masterpiece!"
1.0,1058966-red,One of my Top 10 Favorites.
1.0,1058966-red,A masterpiece of cinema but it might take more than one viewing (of the entire trilogy) to be able to appreciate KK. If someone like Blake or Da Vinci made a movie this would be it. I am in love with Irene Jacob.
1.0,1058966-red,"Perfect. The story, the characters, the technics..."
1.0,1058966-red,My favourite movie of all time!!!
1.0,1058966-red,An incredible series by Kieslowski...I could watch all three of these on any given day.
1.0,1058966-red,One my favorite films ever!
1.0,1058966-red,I wish Krysztof Kieslowski were still alive to make these kinds of movies.
1.0,1058966-red,"The Three Colors: Blue, White and Red combined are the best"
1.0,1058966-red,Kieslowski's trilogy is just perfect. Can't say which of the films I like the most.
1.0,1058966-red,"... Why is he dead? That's a big waste. Piesewicz is still here, but it's not the same"
1.0,1058966-red,One of the all time greats. Valentine is the character for all ages.
1.0,1058966-red,Amazing performances. My stomach and heart were in knots as the movie progressed. Full of humanity and beautifully executed.
1.0,1058966-red,Vidunderlig! Maravillosa! Wonderfull!
1.0,1058966-red,Like a Maupassant story...unfolding its secrets over many viewings.
1.0,1058966-red,"Irene Jacob is stunning in this movie, and with all the layers of meaning this movie must be watched and rewatched by all moviegoers."
1.0,1058966-red,The best of out of a masterful trilogy.
1.0,1058966-red,"Punainen pÃ¤Ã¤ttÃ¤Ã¤ vÃ¤ritrilogian, mutta on myÃ¶s erillisenÃ¤ elokuvana loistokas. Oikeastaan koko trilogia on tyyliltÃ¤Ã¤n puhdasta minimalismia ja tunnelma pidÃ¤ttÃ¤ytynyttÃ¤. Jokaista asiaa ei siis katsojalle suoraan kerrota, vaan kyse on pÃ¤Ã¤ttelystÃ¤ ja tulkinnasta. TÃ¤mÃ¤ sopii makuuni."
1.0,1058966-red,"My absolute favorite of the Trois Couleurs trilogy, one of my favorite films. The cover is simple genius! I don't think I can watch this ""too many"" times. There are so many links to the other btwo films of the trilogy: the old lady trying to recycle the glass, the final scene ..."
1.0,1058966-red,PERHAPS THE BEST OF THE TRILOGY...
0.0,1058966-red,I didn't like the acting or characters and thought that it tried to understand despair from an idealistic standpoint. Not much gained by watching this film.
1.0,1058966-red,"great ending. dancing with fate, humanity etc. another graet drama by kieslowski"
1.0,1058966-red,"La trilogie est a voir - les trois films sont extraordinaires mais en plus, ils sont liÃ©s. Chaque film comprend une petite partie d'un autre."
1.0,1058966-red,"If you don't like this, you are DEAD INSIDE. That is all."
1.0,1058966-red,Irene Jacob...so many talents outside of the U.S. that we can discover if we only took the time to look. Kieslowski outdoes himself. I loved Trintignant's character...The phone tapping and how it was handled was superb.
1.0,1058966-red,"A stunning film, Kieslowski proves himself yet again."
1.0,1058966-red,One of my all time favourites!

1.0,1058966-red,"the final note in kieslowski's symphony of a trilogy. watching the trilogy in order blew me away. Rouge was the highlight, and also kieslowski's most personal film ever. passionate and complex, the film and the trilogy haunt me for days! the crowning achievement in ALL of kieslowski's works!"
1.0,1058966-red,"Perfection. Leading you inexorably to the complex mesh of emotions that are finally captured and then concluded, in a single image, masterly. It matches and then it exceeds the coda of Blue."
1.0,1058966-red,"perfecta, el colorido es hermoso. los tres colores se unen en sus personajes"
1.0,1058966-red,uuuuuuuh french movies...
1.0,1058966-red,The end of the best Trilogy from my favorite director.
1.0,1058966-red,"Beautiful, but you must watch all three movies; blue, white and then red to appreciate them"
1.0,1058966-red,"I consider the three as one, but the app doesn't, and I couldn't find white, which is my real favourite, so there you go."

1.0,1058966-red,The best one of the three.
1.0,1058966-red,Kieslowski is my favourite director there's something about the way in which he tells a story that makes me feel as though he understands me!! And again a soundtrack that haunts for days.

1.0,1058966-red,"I love the Three Colours triliogy, Rouge is by far my favorite of the three"
1.0,1058966-red,I love this film: has a lot of very heartwarming moments and a lot of alienation and animosity but the overall spirit of the film is optomstic with a happy ending for all. I think the location of Geneva is instrumental to the film's ethos.
1.0,1058966-red,I love this film. Lost in Translation for me is a similar film whereby the atmosphere is so captivating that it gives the film a dream like feeling. A true classic.

1.0,embrace_of_the_serpent,"If you like nature / artsy movies, this is beautifully filmed with an amazing story of the culture lost. The ending was amazing. The story has many difficult and violent images, much more severe since they are based on real events. If you're not drawn into the story you would be bored."

1.0,the_conformist,A movie that makes me remember why cinema is art.
1.0,the_conformist,"The Conformist is one of the most beautiful visions of life ever recorded on film, displaying Italy's architecture as monuments surrounded by tableau."
1.0,the_conformist,The ending. The very last scene in the movie. That look he gives without saying anything at all says everything about his character outline throughout the entire movie. I'm blown away.
1.0,the_conformist,"The Conformist is commendable for its lavish production and masterful photography, certainly, but where the brilliance lies is in its portrayal of a man who is in a constant struggle with not only his political affiliations, but with his marriage, his sexuality, and his life."
1.0,the_conformist,"Exquisite, poignant, and extremely alluring."
1.0,the_conformist,"Another take on the banality of evil, through the cowardice and desire for conformity even though he is aware things outside of such conformity. An entirely visual rumination on life, but difficult if to follow narratively."
1.0,the_conformist,The title says it all.
1.0,the_conformist,??...????????????...???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
1.0,the_conformist,A must see film. Bertolucci is completely at ease and this is where it all starts.
1.0,the_conformist,"'Animula vagula blandula Hospes comesque corporis' (Little soul of mine, tender and soft, sweet companion of my body). Capturing Rene Magritte's surreal paintings, this film about identity portrays an unforgettable cinematic and dynamic style of beauty."
1.0,the_conformist,"One of my favourite films - a perfect cast, great cinematography, fantastic use of colour and space. Hard to beat."
1.0,the_conformist,"Far less deep than it appears to be, The Conformist is sustained by the beauty of its compositions and the elegance of its camerawork, which capture the false grandeur of fascist Italy and one man's attempt to evade its evil in order to live a ""normal"" life."
1.0,the_conformist,"Dialogues, performances, cinematography, soundtrack: everything works perfectly and creates a tense atmosphere that helps the film to become one of Bertolucci's great masterpieces."
1.0,the_conformist,the best photographed film I have ever seen.

1.0,the_conformist,So contemporary so beautiful.
1.0,the_conformist,"Simplesmente uma obra prima. Meio que uma mistura de noir com arthouse.. Puta que me pariu, visualmente lindo , atuaÃ§Ãµes perfeitas (destaque pra Dominique Sanda que alem de atuar bem, pqp que mulher..) de primeira pode atÃ (C) parecer um pouco confuso, mas nada de mais.. recomendadÃ­ssimo."
1.0,the_conformist,"Gorgeous, possibly the best-looking movie ever made. Also some jaw-dropping direction and acting, and a huge story which is ultimately a bit too sprawling. But a must-see movie for anyone who loves movies."
1.0,the_conformist,"I could wach this movie without any sound, as it is such a great exercise in style. Bertolucci's masterpiece as far as I am concerned, and a sad reminder that the guy hasn't made anything approaching this level since the mid-70s. Resting on your laurels there, Bernardo?"

1.0,the_conformist,"As drama it just about works, but this is elevated into the ranks of greatness by the breathtaking cinematography. Every frame is a poem: the use of light, colour, shadow, shading, smoke, mirrors! Absolutely incomparable."
1.0,the_conformist,"One of the greatest movies ever. Has such a powerful theme of having to conform to ones society, obviously if you look at the title. Amazing cinematography, acting, directing and writing. This really struck a chord in me after watching it. Also one of the best endings ever."
1.0,the_conformist,A fantastic film about Italian fascism and beautifully shot as well.
1.0,the_conformist,"If the ideas don't touch the imagination, the film's sensuous texture does. It's a triumph of feeling and of style - lyrical, flowing, velvety style, so operatic that you come away with sequences in your head like arias"
1.0,the_conformist,"Probably my favorite film of all time. Best cinematography of all time, best art direction, one of the best scripts... just too much good stuff to say on here without feeling like I forgot something, so just see it for yourself."
1.0,the_conformist,"Classy, beautiful, and intriguing. A masterpiece in so many levels!"
1.0,the_conformist,"one of the early Bertolucci masterpieces- immaculate cinematography, and a theme that has been theoretically analyzed SO much by academia that is reason enough not to mention more about it here. absolute classic and a must-watch-it for any serious film buff."
1.0,the_conformist,Italian Cinema at its best
1.0,the_conformist,"THe film that annced a new master of cinema in the form of Bernardo Bertolucci... Before the REvolution was fine, 'Partner' was weird, but htis is the real McCoy. Stylistically brilliant, chic, immaculately acted and entirely memorable."
1.0,the_conformist,A masterpiece - Bertolucci's film addresses issues of self-betrayal and repression in a movie way ahead of it's time. The beauty of the film remains intact after nearly forty years.
1.0,the_conformist,"A terrifying picture of a person who commits atrocities by allowing others around him to take the actions. The acting is brilliant. Not only is Dominique Sanda unutterably beautiful, but there is a scene where she gives one of the most powerfully horrifying performances I have ever seen on screen."
1.0,the_conformist,IL MEGLIO DEL MEGLIO DEL CINEMA ITALIANO
1.0,the_conformist,Autobiography of a nation.

1.0,the_conformist,"the cinematography in il conformista is some of the most inspiring lighting and composition i've ever seen in a film. although the plot is hard to follow, due to structure and pacing, it is still a fascinating way to tell a story."
1.0,the_conformist,"shakes your insides. a beautiful capture of relationship, violence, weak vs strong, person vs fascism, beautiful scenes and...I love 70'ies."
1.0,the_conformist,"supremoper tecnica, estetica e vicendasplendido trintignant e seducente Dominique Sandail film più attuale di bertoluccie probabilmente il più riuscitosenza parole."
1.0,the_conformist,"Fantastic. A hypnotizing look at Fascism and conformity. The only reason not to see this film is if you happen to be illiterate and are unable to read subtitles, otherwise this is not to be missed."
1.0,the_conformist,"A perfect existentialist film with a double-edged finale, enveloped in Plato's fable of the Cave. It builds slowly and steadily to the most devastating final fifteen minutes of a film anyone is likely to see - if you like novels like The Pigeon and The Tenant, see this at once."
1.0,the_conformist,Sick film. Great cinematography. Top notch acting. I love it. The assassination scene in the forest is one of the most brutal scenes you're ever likely to see. The two main actresses are super hot. This is never a bad thing.
1.0,the_conformist,"There is no doubting. This is an incredible film. The editing, performances, mise-en-scene, music -- particularly the way the framing isolates the conformist against the colour, movement and lighting of other objects."
1.0,the_conformist,bertollucci has done an unlinear story-telling from 1970!! what a great movie...
1.0,the_conformist,"Well-observed relationships, gorgeous photography. I'd like to see this again and again."
1.0,the_conformist,"A beautiful film, the most stylish of all. Bertolucci's drama focuses on intrigue, sex, and politics. Trintignant is a european Bogart."
1.0,the_conformist,Bertolucci's absolute masterpiece....
1.0,the_conformist,one of the most amazing pieces of art i've seen.
1.0,the_conformist,"The possible influence of Foucault in examining what normalcy is, might be, should be, could be makes for a great character study."
1.0,the_conformist,I doubt it is still possible to make a film like that...
1.0,the_conformist,I saw this about thirty times when I was 20. It has all kinds of subtexts that subvert the original storyline from the novel as well as the overt intentions of the director. Drenchingly beautiful with one of the finest movie scores ever.
1.0,the_conformist,"My favorite scene is Marcello Clerici's visit to his father in classical Roman bedlam. No, it's Giulia's dance in the apartment."
1.0,the_conformist,"Brilliant! Probably Bertolucci's best. We are taken into the heart of a shallow man. Should be inane, but it's gripping. Trintignant is riveting. The photography is magnificent. Master film making."
1.0,the_conformist,"the best foreign language film ever made. beautiful cinematography, classic use of light from the masters Bertolluci & Vittorio Storaro"
1.0,the_conformist,"LOOOOVED IT. Stylishly filmed, beautifully put together, all the characters are fantasticly written, it might even jump to a ***** after a rewatch. -Done ;)- Just see it."
1.0,the_conformist,The greatest cinematography of all time boosts a great film into the pantheon of the greatest films. Bertolucci created a great film that had a huge influence on The Godfather.
1.0,the_conformist,"Between Scarfiotti's art design, Delerue's period score, Storaro's lenses and Bertolucci's emerging operatic style, AND the beauty of Dominique Sanda and a young Trignitant juxtaposed against the spineless cruelty of fascist minds, it does not get better than this film classic."
1.0,the_conformist,[i]Review coming soon.[/i]
1.0,the_conformist,A heavy influence on The Godfather. Visually stunning with a great story.
1.0,the_conformist,The mind's eye boggles
1.0,the_conformist,"Beautiful film about a sheep in wolves clothing. It occasionally overstretches itself in the style department and the metaphor with Plato's cave is pretentious, but is thought-provoking and brave in depicting the choices made in the rarely discussed (internally, anyway) fascist-era Italy."
1.0,the_conformist,"this movie is a combination of: some of the best use of light and shadow ever seen on film and an enormously engrossing story with extremely compelling characters. In other words, it is one of cinema's best."
1.0,the_conformist,Bertolucci's dispaly of his talent before he got lost in political explorations and artistic falsehoods.
1.0,the_conformist,Still flawless after all these years.

1.0,the_conformist,"Haha, What can I say that hasn't been said already? Just go see it! I might have to watch it again because I was so amazed by the visuals that I barely paid attention to the story."
1.0,the_conformist,"Fantastic cinematography, very slow paced although I didn't see this as a downer I can see it puting a lot of people off."
1.0,the_conformist,Stunningly cinematography and elegantly structured nonlinear plotting makes Bertolucci's study of sex and politics a must see. This is film at it's classiest.
1.0,the_conformist,"In college, this movie, along with Faulkner, ended my alleged med school career as I realized that art was far more interesting."
1.0,the_conformist,Brilliant beautiful movie that must be seen in a movie theater to be fully appreciated.
1.0,the_conformist,"Visually stunning. It's rare when I finish a movie and want to immediately start it up again. Call it a short attention span or a continuing thirst for new stimulation, but either way, I needed to back and rewatch some."
1.0,the_conformist,Exceptional. Storaros photography is magnificent.
1.0,the_conformist,"bravo bertolucci, and with out Brando or naked French teenagers (disappointedly of course), bravo."
1.0,the_conformist,"i've never seen anything quite like this film. The marriage of story, camera, character and theme make it overpowering every time i watch it. So many virtually perfect scenes...the chase music...the swirling leaves...train sex...black/white, confession, the asylum..."

1.0,the_conformist,"A beautiful expressionist film, which has the distinction of containing some of the best cinematography ever committed to film. In addition, the depth of character and story helps to make it a cinematic classic."
1.0,the_conformist,Most beautiful Film to date. I remember the first time I watched it on a big screen. I couldn't believe my eyes.
1.0,the_conformist,Un des films importants de ma vie. Une adaptation d'un roman de Moravia avec en toile de fond l'Allegorie de la caverne de Platon et en prime la tres charmante Dominique Sanda. Je voulais faire ma maitrise en litterature sur Bertolluci... J'y ai decouvert Platon et Georges Leroux.
1.0,the_conformist,Stunningly enchanting cinematography with so many layers in the story line that you can watch again and read new meaning
1.0,the_conformist,"The ""anti-realism"" of Bertolucci + Alberto Moravia's novel on Fascism and sexual repression = beautiful."
1.0,the_conformist,"It can be an intimate gangster movie, a psycho drama or simply a fable of what happens when you just do what you're told. Great, great story!"
1.0,the_conformist,"It's a scandal that this isn't out on DVD in the UK. Bertolucci's masterpiece, beautifully shot by Vittorio Storaro."
1.0,the_conformist,"The film that made me want to learn Italian, so I wouldn't have to glance away from the images to read the subtitles. Gorgeous, funny, ironic, weird. You must see it, whoever you are."

1.0,the_conformist,There aren't enough movies made like this beauty!
0.0,the_conformist,What was this film all about? What did the director and crew tried to tell us? It seems I will never know!!!
1.0,the_conformist,"Hated it the first time I saw it, but it really is an amazing film."
1.0,the_conformist,"One of the great films of it's era. A compelling stylish examination of the fascist mentality. Extremely influential in terms of cinematography and design, especially on The Godfather films."
1.0,the_conformist,Absolutely stunning.
1.0,the_conformist,Brilliant.Just brilliant.
1.0,the_conformist,"Totalement d'accord avec le Harrisson sur ce film. Mais hey l'ami, t'as pas vu Babel, hehehe. D'ailleurs je vais aller le commenter de suite."
1.0,the_conformist,Superb adaptation of Morovia book. Directed by Bertolucci and shot by the great Victorio Storaro atthe height of their powers. A masterpiece.
1.0,the_conformist,"one of the my favorite films. extremely dark film about a closeted psychopath turned fascist killer who confronts his destiny when he falls in love with the androgynous and bi-sexual wife of his ex professor, the man he has been ordered to kill."
1.0,the_conformist,"I'm a sucker for the mis-en-scene in this film, but it also has a hell of a good story."
1.0,the_conformist,Designer Fascism! Lesbian tango! Plato's cave! Devastating assassination scene! Bernardo Bertolucci's finest hour!

1.0,the_conformist,I just love Bertolucci
1.0,the_conformist,This movie is beautifully shot and executed. Can't believe it was made in 1970.
1.0,the_conformist,"bizarrely, if you've ever seen it, the movie I based my first student film on. Thank god Criterion released it on DVD - now I can toss my awful DVD dubs of crappy VHS dubs of a long unavailable laserdisc edition... Maybe the best film Bertolucci ever made"
1.0,the_conformist,Fantastic cinematography.
1.0,the_conformist,A sumptuous film that not enough people know about. Its credit is much overdue.
1.0,the_conformist,"One of My Favorite Films. Amazing, Amazing, Amazing. A must Watch."
1.0,the_conformist,very beautiful film and arguably the best film of Bernardo Bertolucci.
1.0,the_conformist,Existential Noir at its finest; a breathtakingly shot period piece.
1.0,the_conformist,"Filled with intrigue, betrayal, beauty and tragedy. Just the way I like 'em."
1.0,the_conformist,"My favorite scene occurs when Marcello buys the Parma Violets from the street woman, who immediately summons two ragamuffins to sing the internationale as they follow Marcello, visibly discomfited, back to Anna."
1.0,the_conformist,"Every scene is filled with beautiful cinematography, intense dialogue and unforgettable expressions."
1.0,the_conformist,Bertolucci at his best!
0.0,the_conformist,bad movie. Highly overrated.
1.0,the_conformist,This is worth watching for Vittorio Storaro's outstanding cinematography alone but this is also a highly intriguing character study of a man (Jean-Louis Trintignant) who is a Fascist agent under the Mussolini regime. This is Bertolucci at his very best.
1.0,the_conformist,A masterpiece of drama/eros/noir/politics and entertaining regardless of whatever language you watch it in (but you'd better not watch it dubbed!!) Pre 'Godfather' genious
1.0,the_conformist,"Light, colour, beauty and moral decay."
1.0,the_conformist,This film is part of the reason I want to do what I do.
1.0,the_conformist,"Visual feast, one of most cinematic films ever made and one of the best films ever"
1.0,the_conformist,"Absoluely beautiful in every single way. Dramatically complex, visually stunning - it puts a total spell on you."
1.0,the_conformist,"Probably one of the most beautifully shot films I've ever seen. The use of angles, light and color is among the best I've ever seen. Not to say the plot itself is slouching, as it's a great and horrifying story of what a man will do to be accepted by society."
1.0,the_conformist,"Beautiful film. Long tracking shots, sparse dialogue. Storraro is the real star of the film."
1.0,the_conformist,"Visually brilliant, this is THE filmmaker's film. The camera seems to be a character just as much as the actors, which makes it all the more entralling..."
1.0,the_conformist,Overwhelmingly beautiful. Haunting. Tragic.
1.0,the_conformist,One of the best films ever made. Seriously.
1.0,the_conformist,A total classic that still has the power and intensity that it held when it was first made.
1.0,the_conformist,It's all about Vittorio Storaro for me.
1.0,the_conformist,This is a miracle. The enchanting elegancy of its image established this film as a classic work of Italian cinema.
1.0,the_conformist,"my favourite movie, the camera work is brilliant, a must see for all movie lovers!"
1.0,the_conformist,A terrifying look at how it can be worse to allow evil to happen than to do evil yourself. Cinematography of a nearly unparalleled nature.
1.0,the_conformist,One of the best films of all time - bar none. The camera work & photography here is almost orgasmic. Brilliant.
1.0,the_conformist,a beautiful amazingly haunting film who's poignancy and meaning still retains especially in our current world
1.0,the_conformist,Storaro at his best. One of my all time favorite films.
1.0,the_conformist,"Possibly the top 3 best movies ever seen in my life. The meaningful lighitng palette, the imaginative use of tilts and trackings, and more importantly, the arrangement of subjects within the frame, in other words, arbitrary composition"
1.0,the_conformist,A film which highlights the connections between conformity and fascism. A later sequel showed the connections between the Fashion Industry and conformity. The final part of the trilogy (called Fashionism) wraps everything up neatly. Watch this film.
1.0,the_conformist,Bertolucci is a true cinematic auteur.
1.0,the_conformist,Watched it again recently. Gets better with every viewing. A director and cinematographer at the height of their respective games.
1.0,the_conformist,I watched it on the big screen. It met me expectations in every single frame. The finest cinematography I have ever seen.
1.0,the_conformist,cinematography kicks all kinds of ass. The surrealism mixed with a noir wash is breathtaking.
1.0,the_conformist,"Excellent depiction of the effect of fascism upon a unique, complex man, desperate to convince the world that he is no different than anyone else. It builds slowly, but the final fifteen minutes are truly powerful stuff."
1.0,the_conformist,Stunning direction and camera work along with excellent performances and a truly fascinating plot make this an excellent movie that can't be missed by film buffs or Bertolucci fans.
1.0,the_conformist,I don't why you would call yourself a cinematographer or a director if you didn't make an effort to watch this flick. Storaro and Bertolucci collaborating. This film really influenced me the most visually.
1.0,the_conformist,bertolucci's greatest film and like vigo he was only 29
1.0,the_conformist,"This is a masterpiece of 1970's european cinema, made when Bertolucci was still only 30. I think it is his greatest film, shot on the border crossing between dream and nightmare."
1.0,the_conformist,One of the greatest films ever.
1.0,the_conformist,One of those you have to see 2x to understand. But one of the most attractive color films ever.
1.0,the_conformist,"Beautiful, gripping, disturbing."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"This is not a film, this is a remorseless testimony. 'army of shadows' will mark you like (very) few films. Never did I see such a cold-blooded way to shoot a film, and never did I see such unbearable tension. No one but Kessel could have written it, and no one but Melville have directed it I guess."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Melville captured me with his long study of characters. These characters are freedom fighters in the resistance during WWII. The audience cannot help but be impressed by the conviction in these fighters. I want to see it again.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"ARMY OF SHADOWS is one of the greatest war films I've ever seen. It is a melancholy, deep and honest depiction of desperate people in a dark period of history. Riveting all the way through, this is an indisputable masterpiece from the great French filmmaker Jean-Pierre Melville."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"As of today, Army of Shadows is the greatest film I've ever seen. Never have I been as paralyzed as I was by a film's greatness. Genius flows in every frame."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"One of the great films about the French resistance, Army of Shadows was not well thought of when it was first released in 1969, but is now thought of as one of Melville's greatest films. Riveting."
1.0,army_of_shadows,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"An engrossing, brutally frank story of bleak isolation and paranoid dread. A heartbreaking masterpiece."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"A work of precision, Army of Shadows while ill paced, is a profoundly philosophical investigation of humanity, morality and bravery."
1.0,army_of_shadows,as good as it gets as a portrait of courage and an anti-faschist polemic
1.0,army_of_shadows,my favorite french film
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Army of Shadows is a dark, harrowing & brutal depiction of the French Resistance with unforgettable scenes of heroism & danger."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Beautifully shot, gloriously atmospheric, and meticulously gripping. A rich film about the underground French Resistance during WWII. I'd rank it up with ""Battle for Algiers,"" ""Z,"" and ""The Manchurian Candidate"" for great political thrillers."
1.0,army_of_shadows,All I can say is wow.
1.0,army_of_shadows,One of the best war films you're likely to find.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"A film to be watched like wine is to be drank. Saviour this for all its subtleties, nuances and textures... it is so rich. Go slow and have patience."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Best film about any Resistance movement I have seen in a long time.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Slow movie but a great one about the french resistance.
0.0,army_of_shadows,Not something Id watch more then once
1.0,army_of_shadows,The best movie I've ever seen. No other movie has ever made me feel the amount of tension that Army of Shadows has. As close as anyone could ever get to being a member of the French Resistance.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Encore un classique !
1.0,army_of_shadows,Supremely realistic film that gets under your skin and stays with you long after the credits have rolled. One of the masterpieces of French Cinema and one of the best films I've ever seen. 9.5/10
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Melville is known more for his ""Le Doulos"" and ""Le Samourai"" but this brilliant film focussing on the French resistance is a rare piece of Cinematic genius.Multi layered,suspenseful,realistic and ultimately cynical,this is a keeper."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"For some strange reason this film was either banned or never shown in the US until recently. A powerful yet bleak view of so called heroism during WWII. You could even leave the cinema with a doubt about who are in the right in any war when it comes to torture, abuse and murder. Gripping stuff."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Wonderfully complex take on the French resistance. All drama is quiet, and while there is suspense, a good bit of it is generated by moral dilemmas and the lengths to which ""heroes"" must go during wartime."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"The price of espionage troops.Ventura,Signoret,Meurisse,the all-star cast of Melville was ready to drum the front-line of A-class film-making,of which the remains of it some decades later are distant echoes,entangled subplots,why...I'll admit only Hitler was missing!"
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Not so much a war movie as a movie about ordinary people doing what they can do, even if it appears futile. The performances are all outstanding and the colour of this movie (or at least the exemplary Criterion Collection edition) is so beautiful it remains with you for days."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Un film crÃ©pusculaire qui donnent Ã  rÃ©flÃ©chir sur le vrai visage de la rÃ©sistance.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Melville's masterpiece. It is heartbreaking at times, ironic at times and darkly comedic at times. Melville is a master at mood."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Brilliant film! one of the darkest eras in history, done with grace and subtle humor. Obvious to see that many directors today have aspires to do what Melville achieved in this masterpiece."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Outstanding film. Superb. The cinematography is excellent and the mood is intense. See this.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"The French resistance in WWII are shown here in a very different way to any other depiction I have seen. The film is very bleak - the colours, the sound, the course of events. Absolutely brilliant."
1.0,army_of_shadows,one of the bleakest films i have ever seen. the cinematography and pacing of the film are so masterful!
1.0,army_of_shadows,"A parody on the tv series 'Allo, 'Allo."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"great film!I do not care for most war films, but this film I loved! meville's texture always gets my attention."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Melville's best non-crime film... then again, it's about underground resistance fighters in ww2 so it kind of is, and it has that dirty, cold feel that all Melville pictures have so well. It's really amazing, if long, and anyone interested in something from France on the subject should see it."
1.0,army_of_shadows,The best foreign language film I have ever seen after Das Boot. Masterpiece on all levels
1.0,army_of_shadows,A spy suspense thriller classic. Rich on not just entertainment level but also character development level. Intense and emotionally powerful.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Melville explores morality, rebellion and emotion amidst the Nazi occupation in France."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"One of the most challenging and beautiful films I have ever witnessed. Army of Shadows is a deep and complex study of Humanity in its darkest times, and all the greatness and horror that can come from it. Melville's masterful direction adds art and atmosphere to every frame."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"The struggles of the French in WWII, are finally given their due. Watch these cheese eating surrender monkeys deal with problems you could never imagine and make the decisions you aren't prepared to make. And such a pretty package too!"
1.0,army_of_shadows,Great resistance film. Best Melville film in my opinion.
1.0,army_of_shadows,None is fair in love and war.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Melville's best picture. It provides an emotional context for the rest of his work.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Un film impressionnante, comme tout chez Melville."
1.0,army_of_shadows,A film about the French Resistance that you will never forget.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Creative and amazing pacing, inspiring characters and inspired acting, strong and suspenseful story ... it's best war film I've ever seen and among the top films I've watched to date in years of moving watching. The antithesis of the American block buster."
1.0,army_of_shadows,insightful and humane look at the french resistance during WW2 - not miss!
1.0,army_of_shadows,Love this film. Reminded me so much of Munich that I can't help but think Spielberg ripped the look and feel of this movie off.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Absolutely brilliant. Puts his other films in a new perspective.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Simone Signoret at her best ...
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Incredible movie, dark and beautiful.A certain memory about the murder of the traitor."
1.0,army_of_shadows,The best and most thematic of Melville's movies. I'll never forget to run.
1.0,army_of_shadows,coldest tone of any movie I have seen... very bleak
1.0,army_of_shadows,The best movie I've seen in a theater. The darkness was so thick it was tangible. This movie will tear you apart with it's calculated pace and chilling exterior.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Dark, somber, tense."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"This chef d'oeuvre has been shot in 1969, damn it !!!"
1.0,army_of_shadows,I love a film that doesn't flinch and requires the same of its viewers. Brilliantly understated!
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Tremendous! Lino Ventura is a presence to be seen and seen again. Paul Meurisse and Simone Signoret together after ""Les Diaboliques"" is great! Melville's greatest film! Although just as great as ""Le Samourai"" or ""The Silence of the Sea."""
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Absolutely fantastic; utterly captivating. Great acting plus lots of tension and suspense. It's hard to believe this film didn't make it our for 37 years! It's long, but it doesn't feel like it -- I didn't want it to end."
1.0,army_of_shadows,After two days I'm still at a loss for words. All I can say is this: that was a friggin' journey.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Harrowing account of being in the French Resistance. Will resonate long after you've finished watching it, like years after you've finished watching it."
1.0,army_of_shadows,The problem with watching this movie is that you never get to watch it again for the first time.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Amazing! They sure don't make them like they used to. The film has been in the shadows for too long, this should be up there in the top 50 films of all time."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"It's unbelievably challenging to watch, but it's one of the most intense and powerful movies I've ever seen. I loved it."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Epoch and extraordinary.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Beautiful film about friendship, brotherhood, patriotism and sacrifice. Army of Shadows shows the struggle of the French Resistence during the Second World War."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"So good. The fact that this came out just two years ago is a shame. Easily the best Melville work and a contender for best French film of the sixties, Army of Shadows shows us the fallout from the war on France, and the devastating tolls it exacts from its citizens."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"A wonderful masterpiece presenting the early days of the French resistance. Melville's direction is flawless, weaving scenes of great atmosphere and tension. To think it was almost lost forever makes its restoration incredible."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"This film is pretty amazing. its a film about the french resistance, during the German takeover of France. it may move a bit slowly, but it is a great thriller."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Proabably top three best all around movies i've ever seen. Very influencial to both Francis Ford Coppola and Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. Gripping and suspenseful through and through.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Classic.Ventura is just perfect. Dark, intense and really sad."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"melville never ceases to amaze. i'm no expert on art/film about the resistance, but this has to be one of the best. ventura is amazing."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Absolutely amazing and effecting view of World War II. Fully recommended.
1.0,army_of_shadows,This is a striking and beautiful film. Flawless. The ending was perfect. Very impressive. It is one of my favorites.
1.0,army_of_shadows,this is one of the most flawless movies ever made. it has that cold mechanical brilliance that made melville's le samourai the most flawless movie i thought ever made before i saw this one.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"This is not a film about the war, this is about humanity."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Thankyou to Criterion for introducing me to this film. It totally blew me away. Melville creates a mood unlike any I've experienced.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Melville had his shit together. I still prefer Le Samorai.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Best. War Film. Ever.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Excellent, excellent film"
1.0,army_of_shadows,Melville was a cinematic genius.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"An amazing film. Subtle at times in the violence, but direct in others, you can feel the tension, desperation and dedication to the greater cause, even when their formal training and discipline (or lack thereof) leads to the hardest decisions."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Remarkable in every way. A must see+++++
1.0,army_of_shadows,"A wonderful movie that turns the duel between good and evil into a struggle for survival and were heroes are forced to behave like gangsters. The coldness of the actors and of the light gives the impression that each character carries death on his shoulder, others' and his."
1.0,army_of_shadows,A masterpiece! An absolute must!
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Another late 60s masterpiece by Melville, no less a ""cool"" existential tragedy than Le Samourai or Le Cercle Rouge."
1.0,army_of_shadows,The greatest French resistance film finally is released in the states.
1.0,army_of_shadows,C'est juste le meilleur film franÃ§ais de l'histoire du cinema ...
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Perhaps Melville's greatest. Made in 69, it ended up being hands-down the greatest film of 2006 (when it was finally shown on the big screen in the US). This is the sort of ""war"" film Spielberg's tiny brain cannot even dream of cooking up"
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Excellent and depressing film about those who fought in secret against insurmountable odds, never to see the fruit of their labors. Also includes a rare documentary on the bonus disc with the footage of the last days of combat between civilians and nazi troops on the streets of Paris."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"The criterion cover is much better than this poster, btw! The most magisterial, and fully developed of all of Melville's films, it is a beautiful and poignant film which not only witnesses to the particularities of the time it covers, but touches upon the perennially human."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Melville, bien sur, le seul Ã  pouvoir rÃ©aliser un film comme celui lÃ . Magistralement interprÃ©tÃ© par l'ensemble des acteurs."
1.0,army_of_shadows,It is all to telling that today in 2007 This film is more relevant ever.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Un film d'une rare intensitÃ©. Tout y est glacÃ©, comme la pÃ©riode durant laquelle l'action prend place. Sans doute une des oeuvres les plus impressionnantes sur la rÃ©sistance, sa violence comme mal nÃ©cessaire."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Top du top Melville.
1.0,army_of_shadows,every one MUST see this movie. It's awesome and so powerful
1.0,army_of_shadows,masterpiece. Signoret is unique
1.0,army_of_shadows,LE film sur la RÃ©sistance.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"The best film I've seen in the last year, this is a virtual masterpiece. The pace, the settings, and the acting are all superb."
1.0,army_of_shadows,This was the best film I saw all year.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Puisqu'il est question d'Ã©difier les lycÃ©ens... Peut-Ãªtre pourrait-on leur projeter cette oeuvre? Sans esbroufe.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Contains one of the best constructed scenes of intensity and desparation ever captured. Wholly engrossing.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Beautiful movie. Melville has done a wonderful job showing hope, when there is little or no hope to be found."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Days in the life of the French resistance. Uncompromising and unsentimental; Jean-Pierre Melville's finest film. Lino Ventura's face speaks louder about the dehumanizing force of war than just about anything else in all of cinema.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"The one thing I would change: iIwould put the opening scene back at the end of the movie, where it originally belonged. Other than that, I can't think of a flaw in it."
1.0,army_of_shadows,A French film not obsessed with fashion; who thought it possible?
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Wicked movie by a master of french cinema, Melville takes the french resistance and brings them to life in this harrowing tale of desperation during WW 2"
1.0,army_of_shadows,Incredibly rewarding.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Every frame of this movie deserves to be matted and hung on your wall, and the fact that you haven't done this makes you a worse person. The color, the shots, the mise en scene, the acting - this is marvelous."
1.0,army_of_shadows,This is probably my favorite movie ever. Jean-Pierre Melville is the master of this genre and gangster films and this is the truest film adaptation of the french resistance ever made.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Great melancholic and unsentimental - the resistance portrayed like sympathetic gangsters doing a difficul and terrible job.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Okay so it's basically the only film I've seen on the Resistance, but I don't doubt that it's one of the best as well."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Incredible French movie from the 70s set during WWII about the Resistance. Super-intense and gritty. Look-out for the parachute jump scene.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"A flick about the French Resistance, but in the style of a film noir. Not really much like a war movie, though... reminded me a lot of Brazil, or 1984... of brave, doomed heroes in their lonely struggle against hopeless odds."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Standing ovation. The Cahiers du Cinema had it all wrong, a rare mistake from the masters of the New Wave. Lino Ventura gives one of the greatest performances in film history. Too bad Melville wasn't around to see the reception the film has received in its 2006 North American release."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Ce que signifient patriotisme et sacrifice dans un pays dÃ©possÃ©dÃ© de son Ã¢me par l'occupation. Un chef d'oeuvre qui montre ce qu'il y avait derriÃ¨re le mot ""rÃ©sistance"", aujourd'hui bien galvaudÃ©e."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"The exact title for this part of french history, by one of his lead director and formal underground ""actor"" of this war..."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"One of my single favorite movies. Extra slick, super elegant (with often perfectly noticeable, low budget) cinematography that is as evocative as the storyline: frumpy, sweet dude is actually a resistance fighter and down-and-dirty killer. A meaty opus from the French cowboy Melville."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Yet another great Jean-Pierre Melville flick
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Ce film doit être vu , c'est tout..."
1.0,army_of_shadows,My favorite movie regarding WWII in Europe/occupied France. Almost unbearably tense at moments; definitely not for the sentimental.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Melville has become one of my favorite directors. I have only seen this and Le Samourai but there are no other movies like them. His style is so cool and perfect. I need to see more of his movies.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"This movie grabbed me and threw me into the French resistance along with the other characters. Leaving me feeling just as desperate and hopeless as the others, but still making me never stop to try and change it all and make a difference, even if it means dying for the cause."
1.0,army_of_shadows,It's hard to watch this film without gasping at the exquisite cinematography and top-notch acting.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Amazing and subtle. Exposing the true duality faced by people during wartime.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Absolutely incredible narrative that doesn't show you heroes in resisting the Nazis but explores the moral difficulty they often faced and asks if it was really worth it. The way the characters are presented simply and matter of factly makes this an absolute joy to watch.
1.0,army_of_shadows,The most perfect french resistance film ever.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Brilliant pacing. Brilliant acting. Look for color and use of camera as expression of message through technique. Melville does it all here. The depth of this political-thriller is one you'd seldom find in a genre often filled with little else beyond escapist aspirations and action/chase sequences.

1.0,wages_of_fear,"84% of you should be shamed. Go and watch this and see what you're missing. If a film deserves a perfect 10, (5 even?) then this is it. Wonderful."
1.0,wages_of_fear,-All-time greatest thriller! I stayed up late one night as a kid and just happened to catch this epic.
1.0,wages_of_fear,"EL SALARIO DEL MIEDO,JAJAJAJA"
1.0,wages_of_fear,"(AKA Le Salaire de la peur)Un film incroyablement forte. J'adore, entre autres, la scène où Charles Vanel avance pour délimiter son territoire dans le bar. La prise des pieds dans une sens et autre des personnages es magnifique!"

1.0,wages_of_fear,Fantastic existential suspense.
1.0,wages_of_fear,THE most intense movie ever made.
1.0,wages_of_fear,A genuine nail-biting thriller. I don't mind miserablism when its this exciting.
1.0,wages_of_fear,Easily one of the most intense films ever made. I love these old flicks because they focus on a great story line rather than expensive flashy effects.
1.0,wages_of_fear,Absolutely fantastic - it won't loosen its grip until the horrifying finale.
1.0,wages_of_fear,"Awesome! This was remade in the states as Sorcerer, and was itself pretty good. But Wages is excellent!"
1.0,wages_of_fear,This very well might have been an influence for all puzzle solving third-person video games.
1.0,wages_of_fear,"what a wild ride. so supenseful, i'll bet Hitchcock shit his pants seeing this. sorry for the visual but let's be honest, in pictures doesn't it look like he did and is embarrassed everyone will find out."
1.0,wages_of_fear,This is probably the most suspenseful film of all time. You will dig your nails into your own palm.
1.0,wages_of_fear,"AN absoluetly excellent French movie about four bums that get chosen to drive a bunch of nitroglycerine across rugged terrain. Way ahead of it's time. The suspense is killer. Yeah it's 2:30 long and it's in french, but it's well worth your time."
1.0,wages_of_fear,"Most tense film ever! Very simple idea, brilliant direction and photography, awesome acting...Classic."
1.0,wages_of_fear,Bowled over by this classic. Starts off like one of those Huston/Hawks pictures with Yves Montand in the Bogart role; gets very suspenseful and intriguing. Great movie.
1.0,wages_of_fear,"Classic. What other movie has men driving trucks with one ton of liquid nitrogen over the Andes mountains? Slow at first, but picks up pace after the first hour. If you like classics, don't skip this one."
1.0,wages_of_fear,The most exciting film ever made?
1.0,wages_of_fear,"Suspense film touchstone, political lightning rod."
1.0,wages_of_fear,Maybe the most suspensiful movie of all time. The idea is pure dynamite and Clouzot makes most of it. Can't really get any better than this.
1.0,wages_of_fear,Hitchcock often failed to reach this level of exciting suspense
1.0,wages_of_fear,You think your job is hard!
1.0,wages_of_fear,"One of the best suspense movies ever! Too bad the DVD has censored translations, watch on laserdisk if you can find it for the real dialogue."
1.0,wages_of_fear,"The tensest movie ever made. Also see Friedkin's remake, Sorcerer."
1.0,wages_of_fear,An existential masterpiece.
1.0,wages_of_fear,Brilliant action thriller. Hold your breath and keep still in your seat as you're taken all the way across the desert with a cargo of nitroglycerin!
1.0,wages_of_fear,"Forget your typical American action cinema, this is THE action film to end them all. The intensity is second to none and Clouzot's technique is impeccable."
1.0,wages_of_fear,"This is so exciting. Puts most action movies to shame. And the more I watch it, the more exciting it becomes. Don't be put off by the first half hour (my favourite section of the movie, oddly) this is cracking cinema."
1.0,wages_of_fear,"One of the best films I have ever seen, easily. Clouzot creates an intense atmosphere in every scene, the characters are all absorbing and believable, it is tense, beautiful, gripping and thrilling. I wouldn't alter a single scene."
1.0,wages_of_fear,The best thriller of all time. Perhaps the most intense movie I've ever seen.
1.0,wages_of_fear,"Watch it. If you can't handle older movies, fast forward through the first 45 minutes. But watch it."
1.0,wages_of_fear,awesome action film! intense
1.0,wages_of_fear,Proletarians of the world unite
1.0,wages_of_fear,"One of the finest, tensest thrillers ever filmed, Clouzot's devilish misanthropy makes for electric cinema. Fights it out with The Godfather, Citizen Kane and Chinatown for the Best Film Ever Made title."
1.0,wages_of_fear,"The first half an hour or so seems like a bit of a slog at first, but persevere and you'll discover the most intense suspense-filled couple of hours ever put to celluloid. If you like this, check out Clouzot's Diaboliques - another little known masterpiece"
1.0,wages_of_fear,"Should be listed next to ""white-knuckled"" in the dictionary. Why William Fredkin through he could remake this is beyond me."
1.0,wages_of_fear,Sweatiest movie ever with Alien and Cool hand Luke taking second and third. The tension is fabulous and you can feel the jungle heat. Spielburg should have watched this before hacking out Jurassic Park.
1.0,wages_of_fear,Best suspense film ever? Maybe so.
1.0,wages_of_fear,The most suspenseful movie I've ever seen. Brilliant and beautiful. Clouzot's wife plays one of the sexiest bar maids ever in a small role.

1.0,wages_of_fear,Proof that there are great old movies that I've never heard of. One of the most suspenseful movies that I've ever seen.
1.0,wages_of_fear,"A fantastic, suspenseful masterpiece. The story builds slowly, grabs hold of you, and never lets go. Watch this instead of junk like those stupid pirate movies..."
1.0,wages_of_fear,"One of the best movies I've ever seen; natural suspense, nerve wracking--Clouzot seems to be another Hitchcock"
1.0,wages_of_fear,"breathtaking, thrilling ! And a classic !"
1.0,wages_of_fear,The most nerve-wracking film I've ever sat through. I gripped my chair the entire time and at one point thought I might have a heart attack. To see this film is to know Hitchcock wasn't the only master of suspense out there; Clouzot was in a league of his own.
1.0,wages_of_fear,One of the most nerve shreddingly suspenseful films I've ever seen. A misanthropic masterpiece. I had bitten my fingernails off by the end of it.

1.0,wages_of_fear,Enjoy your fingernails.
1.0,wages_of_fear,"Takes a while to get going, this one - but the slow build takes time to establish characters & why men would put themselves in such a situation. However, once they get moving, one of the most tense, edge-of-your-seat films ever made unfolds! See it now!"
1.0,wages_of_fear,"Nihilistic, bleak and beautiful. The best desperate-men-on-a-suicide-mission-to deliver-a-truck-load-of-nitro-glycerine-to-the-top?of-a-mountain- movie you?ll ever find! If you like happy endings, then steer clear"

1.0,the_class,"Tremendous. Fantastically shot and acted, and if you want verisimilitude, look no further than here.

1.0,the_class,Absolutely brilliant! One of the best films of last year IMO. A moving anthropological study of modern life. And good enough to help the situation as well. In a few decades this film will be regarded as a classic early 21st century film which helped improve the way we live.
1.0,the_class,"Whenever someone asks me what it's like to be a middle school teacher, I am going to direct them to this movie. Capturing the ups and downs of life ""between the walls"" (the French title) of a modern classroom, the characters in this story are neither angels nor demons."

1.0,pather_panchali,"I don't know how to put the experience of watching a satyajit ray movie in words yet; it's so tender in its portrayal, so simplistic in its depiction that sometimes no words or even obvious actions are required to sense the underlying emotions that are so very vivid."

1.0,pather_panchali,"I don't know how to describe a film like this, a very tragic film that showcases and contrasts the similarities of both youth and the aged, the neglect and also often, just the plain plainness of life where not even art can have a mean ing anymore, like the father who's a playwright an poet."

1.0,a_separation_2011,What a movie! An emotionally packed story from start to finish. Not once did I take my eyes away from the screen. The acting was top-notch. Everybody was good! Literally. But the best performances belong to Peyman Moadi and Sereh Bayat. Great Movie.

1.0,a_separation_2011,"Incredibly absorbing and emotional, shows how little decisions in our lives can lead to enormous consequences in ourselves or others.

1.0,a_separation_2011,"What a riveting drama!This movie gets you hooked from the minute it starts and never loses the hold.

1.0,a_separation_2011,Minor Spoiler Alert!!! Deep in my heart the ending replays in my head where the girl is always crying. I really didn't want this movie to end. God Damn you credits!.
1.0,a_separation_2011,"It will take you a little while to get involved with this film. When you do, you won't be able to leave your seat. Misunderstandings trigger frailties that trigger actions that trigger consequences that grip you by the throat and never let go. That's all I'm gonna say without spoiling things."

1.0,a_separation_2011,Another great holdover from 2011! The story aches with a sense of immediacy and the performances are as urgent as they are tender. Treat yourself to this slice of Iranian realism before it slips away from the theaters.

1.0,a_separation_2011,Great plot that made you feel tossed back in forth by waves the whole time. A deep look into the Iranian culture. Watchers will understand more of the subtle nuances in a Muslim marriage as well as the culture as a whole.In a word: Facinating

1.0,a_separation_2011,"Manages to be honest to the turth, and so universally relatable that you just can't help to love it.

1.0,three_colors_blue,"Brilliant, tragic, and rife with coincidence and fate."
1.0,three_colors_blue,"Possibly the most bleak and definitely my favorite of the trilogy, Blue explores how free one can truly be from one's past. It's really sad, but also quite hopeful in it's own way. The direction is flawless and Juliette Binoche is fantastic in the lead role. This is a gem of a film"
1.0,three_colors_blue,It all comes together!
1.0,three_colors_blue,Brilliant cinematography and a breathtakingly tragic plot are enough to mark this one under the masterpiece category.
1.0,three_colors_blue,"A wonderful, evanescent in its execution of grieving and escaping. A woman who wants the quiet life to exist but is faced with questions that arise from her dead husband. The need to exist and except can have its problems. Brilliantly directed and Juliette Binoche is just wonderful. A great film."

1.0,three_colors_blue,"It felt like the perfect balance between motion picture, sound, music, colour and image. A movie so well treated by Kieslowski that every single thing meant something and nothing in the film was pointless or had no reason to be there."
1.0,three_colors_blue,It does not get much better than this.

1.0,three_colors_blue,"My favorite of the ""Three Colours"" trilogy, ""Blue"" is a wonderful work of art, full of beauty and sadness.

1.0,three_colors_blue,Binoche gives an amazing performance in this great film.
1.0,three_colors_blue,"Kieslowski does a superb job with every facet of this film: the narrative, the content, the music, the style, etc. From the unique opening shot all the way to the end, it's a grief-ridden journey that leaves a mark. And Binoche has a commanding performance."

1.0,three_colors_blue,Absolutely beautiful from beginning to end.
1.0,three_colors_blue,"Blue represents freedom. We demands freedom, but is not it arrogant to set free yourself? Like a music, you can't make it sing with only one note."
1.0,three_colors_blue,Bent and old person struggling to stuff empty glass bottles in a recylcing bin is a recurring scene linking the three stories.
1.0,three_colors_blue,C'est absolument splendide. Merveilleux
1.0,three_colors_blue,Blue and Red are my two faves of the trilogy with White pretty dispensible (might need a rewatching). If you see all three Red connects the films together. A very rewarding film.

1.0,three_colors_blue,"why waste time or celluloid on trivia when the deepest things in life are as close as the air we breathe? a film about the beauty and pain of existence, about love and liberty, for better and for worse..."
1.0,three_colors_blue,"The depth of one s heart, one s mind, one s sorrow... a woman who cannot cry ,who keeps trying to suffocate her grief, who renounces everything after her loss but life finds a way to come back to her...she cries at the end, she is set free.... enticing on many levels"

1.0,three_colors_blue,"There are movies and Movies. This is a Movie. This is sort of opposite of ""Pan's labyrinth"" that suffocates the viewer with the underlying meaning that is forced down the viewers throat. This movie breaths. Kieslowski knows the means and is talking to us."
1.0,three_colors_blue,"Blue is a movie that engages the mind, challenges the senses, implores a resolution, and tells, with aesthetic grace and formal elegance, a good story and a political allegory."
1.0,three_colors_blue,Juliette Binoche delivers a tour de force performance in this first installment. Absolutely captivating and executed brilliantly.

1.0,three_colors_blue,I was not sure what I thought of this movie at first. It took me a few days to absorb it I guess. Now it is kind of always with me.
1.0,three_colors_blue,Such blissful unison of images and music makes Kieslowski worthy of god-like status in such divine endeavors. . .
1.0,three_colors_blue,One of the best films I've ever seen.
1.0,three_colors_blue,"la vi hace como 10 años, y la reveo con Jon; nos dimos maraton de la trilogia, 1 por dia."
1.0,three_colors_blue,The first in the Three Colors triology is perhaps the darkest. Kieslowski's tale of loss is truly powerful and the expert cinematography perfectly convey it's themes. I'm so glad Juliette Binoche chose this over Jurassic Park.
1.0,three_colors_blue,"A masterpiece, powerful and stunning"
1.0,three_colors_blue,"The first part of the Three Colours trilogy - Kieslowski last films. The Trilogy does not show up on here - so I'm including this to represent the other two as well: ""Three Colours: White"" and ""Three Colours: Red"". They really should be seen together."
1.0,three_colors_blue,she deserves two Grand-prix of the Cannes!
1.0,three_colors_blue,"Quizas una de las peliculas mas femeninas jamas realizada, acerca del abandono y el engano, con una Juliette Binoche entregando lo mejor de si en cada una de las escenas."

1.0,three_colors_blue,Quite possibly one of the greatest films of the 1990s and one of the few movies which is just enrapturing each time you see it.
1.0,three_colors_blue,This film is amazing. I can't wait to watch Red & White
1.0,three_colors_blue,"My favorite of the ""Three Colors"" trilogy. It's an amazing examination of grief and loss and what a person is willing to do in order to start again."
1.0,three_colors_blue,"As an almost voyeuristic exploration of grief and loss, Blue is also a meditation into the way the creative impulse can pull a soul back from the brink of oblivion. Juliette Binoche's performance is haunting and tragic, and the whole look of the film is mesmerizing."
1.0,three_colors_blue,"Quieres sufrir, vean esto."
1.0,three_colors_blue,I knew I would like this. I love these kind of films where every little gesture and frame mean something and you actually lose something if you are not paying attention. I would like to see it on the big screen.
1.0,three_colors_blue,"No se por que en estos dias me he vuelto a sentir cercana, muy cercana a estas maravillosas peliculas...!"
1.0,three_colors_blue,"Dialog, photography, and psychology. Juliette Binoche is amazing."
1.0,three_colors_blue,"The best of Kieslowski's trilogy, and that's saying a lot. It's also one of the best roles ever for Binoche, who is terrific as a woman whose life is overshadowed by grief and loss. A treasure for fans of character studies and foreign films in general."
1.0,three_colors_blue,Possibly my favorite film of all time. Incredibly deep and moving and impossibly heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time. I have yet to watch a film that is more powerful or thought-provoking.

1.0,three_colors_blue,Juliette Binoche is fantastic!!
1.0,three_colors_blue,"Reminded me of 'La Double vie de Veronique', though this movie was somehow more mature and subtle in its emotional themes. My favourite one out of the three colors."
1.0,three_colors_blue,One of the best movies about grieving and so beautiful!
1.0,three_colors_blue,What can I say? It's my favorite color.Juliette's absolutely fantastic. Great music and cinematography.

1.0,three_colors_blue,"Music, story and cinematography are superb."
1.0,three_colors_blue,"This is a great trilogy. ""White"" is close to me due to the fact that I'm from Russia, the mentality in the movie is the same, it's as if I was watching a story about my country. ""Blue"" is the toughest to watch (Binoche is amazing as always!)."
1.0,three_colors_blue,"Most movies are at best, good stories. Blue is art. Binoche is perfect in the role of the widow coping with the death of her husband and daughter. The cinematography, editing, and music are perfect. See this movie."

1.0,three_colors_blue,"The true masterpiece from Kieslowski .... last scenes of Juliette Binoche were simply breathtaking, in both the emotional and the beauty of it .... plus that score, OMG"
1.0,three_colors_blue,"I just rewatched this, and I cannot express enough how beautifully rich this film is, while also being very spare. Kieslowski was a master of using minimal words to weave intricate tapestries of emotion and humanity. Both political and intensely personal, this film is a masterpiece."
1.0,three_colors_blue,One of the best movies ever. Love the atmosphere. Love the music. Excellent.
1.0,three_colors_blue,I had almost forgotten movies could be this good.

1.0,three_colors_blue,"Amazing, masterful use of a prdemonantly visual medium for a multisensory experience. I felt like I had access to Julie's shock, grief, and hope through the ""blackouts"" and the submersions in the pool. There is a tactileness to the scenes. I can't wait for White and Red!"
1.0,three_colors_blue,I am at a loss for words right now. I could even see this rating increasing in the future right now. This movie is drenched in subtle nuance. I can't wait to see the next two Trois Couleurs
1.0,three_colors_blue,The last movies of Kieslowski.
1.0,three_colors_blue,"i'm speechless. i recommend that after seeing it, you should also watch it with the commentary of annette insdorf. and after seeing this you absolutly have to watch the White and the Red."
1.0,three_colors_blue,"First of the most astonishing cinematographic trilogy. Blue is for 'Liberte', the escape from loss told in visual fragments; an exploration of memory of a woman who loses her family in a car accident. Blue is about survival and the freedom of reinventing live."
1.0,three_colors_blue,Hermosa pelicula. Kieslowski at his best. My favorite film of the color trilogy.
1.0,three_colors_blue,one of the greatest director in film history making one of the deepest films ever and Juliette Binoche giving one of the greatest performances by an actress in film history.

1.0,three_colors_blue,"Visually compelling...*THE standard in art film* Driven solely on visuals, very little talking in this film. I can watch this repeatedly and still come up with new ideas."
1.0,three_colors_blue,What should I say? This is Kieslowski's best and Juliette Binoche ruled the world with the excellent performance.... One of the BESTEST...
1.0,three_colors_blue,Magnificent and marvellous. The sugar-lump close up says more in five seconds than most films manage in ninety minutes.
1.0,three_colors_blue,"Red, White, and Blue interconnect in a creative way--hardly a trilogy in the usual sense of the term. But the story of Binoche and her coming to grips with the loss of her conductor husband and daugher. The scenes of her swimming at night in the lit pool are haunting. Not sure why."
1.0,three_colors_blue,I loved these three movies. Watch this along with the other two (red and white).
1.0,three_colors_blue,"Excellent film making. The use of dramatic classical music and lighting here is remarkable.Juliette Binoche was exceptional in her role as well. Dark, mysterious and sexy, as it says on the cover. One fine film that was well worth watching."

1.0,three_colors_blue,"Beautiful and ultimately depressing. But I stuck through all of The Decalogue, so i assume that White and Red get lighter. Julliette Binoche gives her best performance. The marriage of cinematography and score is outstanding."
1.0,three_colors_blue,"I recommend all the trilogy, ""Blue"" is fantastic. Kieslowski was a great man...RIP"
1.0,three_colors_blue,Top 10 favorite. Have like this since my college days:) Very artistic angles and my favorite color is blue.
1.0,three_colors_blue,"I liked Juliette Binoche from other movies, but this one was shocking and somewhat sexy at the same time.. it just prooves she is a good actress."
1.0,three_colors_blue,"Kieslowki really knows how to use music to his advantage in this film. It feels like a vignette, in that White and Red are somehow connected to it. I liked this one the best, however. Juliette Binoche is amazing (as always)."
1.0,three_colors_blue,Excelente trilogia de Blue Blank y Rouge

1.0,three_colors_blue,"one of my favorite movies... really has to be seen with the two others of the color trilogy but even on it's own (they don't have to be seen together, but it helps) it's a wonderful movie about the pain of grieving, slow and subtle but it gets under your skin"

The power of liberty."

1.0,three_colors_blue,"My favorite one from the ""Trois couleurs"", though the other two are also wonderful movies.Juliette Binoche is also one of my favorite actresses. You cannot miss her performance in ""The English Patient"" (1996) and ""Chocolat"" (2000)."

1.0,three_colors_blue,Kieslowski es un poeta del cine. Unic i irrepetible
1.0,three_colors_blue,"Really important film for any buff. A visual treat for anybody, but expect the plot to be a bit more metaphorical than concrete."
1.0,three_colors_blue,An amazing film. My favorite Kieslowski.
1.0,three_colors_blue,"I'm not sure there's another filmmaker that can translate an idea, a concept into a cinematographic scene as Kieslowski does. He's also highly sensitive. Kieslowsky was a poet. Arguably, the most sensitive of all filmmakers."
1.0,three_colors_blue,This one is the second best.
1.0,three_colors_blue,"Una obra maestra. El dolor, el amor y la libertad abordados con una profundidad increíble. La musica es otro personaje en esta historia, igual de potente que el interpretado por Juliette Binoche."

1.0,three_colors_blue,"Vale la pena ver las tres peliculas de Trois Couleurs de una sentada. Pero si es cuestion de elegir una, elijo esta primero por la gran Juliette (aunque Julie e Irene son fantasticas, tambien) y por la representacion tan tenaz que Kieslowski hace de la libertad!"

1.0,three_colors_blue,I love Krzysztof Kieslowski.
1.0,three_colors_blue,"This is a movie to be watched again and again. It is my idea of a perfect movie. Beautifully shot, great music. Juliette Binoche is lovely."
1.0,three_colors_blue,"I didn't think much of it when I first saw it (what can I say, I was 17), but I've clearly come to love it. How optimistically you read the coda has a lot to do with whether: a) the choral finale is subtitiled (it's not in the DVD box set), and b) you've seen (and loved) Rouge."
1.0,three_colors_blue,"what it is with all these bleak movies...why do i like'em so much. never cared for white or red but this one; i absolutely love. j. binoche's outstanding acting with a haunting soundtrack, topped with beautiful cinematography built around my favorite color, and we have a winner."

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,What a powerful statement of a movie. This movie basically acts as a blueprint to how a community of people can regain their freedom and independence in their country.The whole plot and documentary-like cinematography are definitely something to get inspired by. Awesome movie!

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"A classic study of one of the most important events in the 20th century, which is just as revelant in 2011 with the revolution in Libya taking place as we speak.

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Excellent. Very realistic move about anti-colonial insurrection and urban warfare. French colonial rule in Algeria and its parallels with Iraq are unmistakable.

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"What a movie, in some ways filmed like a documentary. its raw and violent, quite uncompromising. Shows the utter brutalities commited on each side, FLN are portrayed as well organised urban guerillas, who carry on the fight even when all looks hopeless. Dont miss the Ennio Morricone score either"
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,why oh why have I waited this long to see it?? Amongst the rarest of truly greats to grace our screens. It'll visually blow your mind to bits. A hard lesson for all the warmongers and bullies that they'll get theirs sooner or later.

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"Once upon a time France was the oppressive colonialist power in the world. This film pulls no punches when it shows the methods both sides used during the conflict, illustrates the drama on both sides well, and remains remarkably applicable in current world affairs."

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"Quite simply the most exceptional and true to life screen depiction of revolution (I think, although the only revolution I've actually seen is from the MLS). Also, it shows up the French and surely that's a good thing (I think?)"
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Filled with more political symbolism than you can shake a baton at.
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"Real and powerful. A must see. Morricone's music adds to the impact. Impossible to remain unimpressed by Algeria's courageous women. In all, a political journey that gratifies with rare glimpses of the deep alleyways hidden in Algiers' Casbah."

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Best movie of all time.
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,This movie was meant to be a manifesto against colonialism enforced by military power. Nowadays the French general looks more like the prototype of the perfect American soldier determined to fight against terrorism. The 9/11 campaign has changed our view about many things.
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Marvelous and very ahead of its time.
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Pontecorvo's stunningly realised rendition of the struggle against colonialism remains must see viewing for any would be imperialist.

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Amazing B&W; movie shot shortly after the Algerian independence with some of the actual people involved in the uprising. This movie is a historical gem because it shows both sides and does so with many of the people that participated in this part of history.

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"Cold-blooded assasinations, street shoutouts, cafe bombings, riots and torture are the tools used by the Algierian insurgents and occupying French. The warts of both warring factions are shown on both sides in this depressingly familiar, yet utterly fascinating, documentary-style war picture."
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Very much a film a film for now. Wonderful chronicle of events. A great unbiased view on terrorism and the people doing it.

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Great great great film with great editing and camera angles.
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Absolutely riveting. Sets the standard for realism in film. Those assholes in the White House should have watched this before they decided to get into urban warfare in Iraq. No wonder the French wanted to stay out of it.........

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"This is like ""The Wire"" on HBO, but about an insurgency instead of the drug trade. Dispassionate and unsparing about the motivations and failings of both sides."
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,allright you lefty revolutionaries. Here's the real deal.
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Should be required viewing for all wannabe imperialists.
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"The cinematograpy, the acting, the story all place this movie as one of the best ever made. Its funny how the ""terrorists"" were able to portray the French in an evenhanded way, something Hollywood has been unable to do when they are depicting 'terrorists' in lesser films."
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Powerful verisimilitude; screened by the White House in 2003...whether they learned anything from it is the subject of another conversation.

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"A supreme film about the battle of Algiers, watch the version with a native (as I did, with two of my Algerian mates) as some of the subtitles are wrong (purposely) or missing. Was banned in France for over 20 years or something. Oh yeah and the brilliant music is partly by Ennio Morricone."
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Pontecorvo's stunningly realised rendition of the struggle against colonialism remains must see viewing for any would be imperialist.
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Staggering. A real highpoint of the development of cinema. The whole bombing sequence in the middle of the picture is rivetting. Morricone and Pontecorvo's musical choices remain striking to this day.

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"This film has become more significant each year since its release in 1967. It is a very realistic portrayal of the Algerian anti-colonial terrorism campaign which demonizes neither the French nor the Algerians, but points out their strengths and weaknesses."
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"A Post-colonial, cinéma vérité masterpiece. Pontecorvo casted non-professional Algerian Arabs and Gatti shot the film in such a way to make it look like a newsreel or documentary film."
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,The fact that this has been screened to US government officials to analyze terrorist behavior should speak volumes.

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"The ultimate political movie. Pontecorvo shows great skill as a director with his cast of non-actors. Pontecorvo and Solinas crafted a script so powerful, so politically relevant today."
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Further evidence that you can't fight terrorism with more terrorism. The fact this film was screened for CIA operatives PRIOR to the invasion (and subsequent occupation) of Iraq simply proves that we've learned almost nothing from history.
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Everyone should see this movie. It is just as relavent today as it was fourty years ago.
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Awesome flick. FYI: officers in the US army were told to see this movie before the invasion of iraq to learn counter-insurgency tactics. Funny since the French lost.

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"This movie is a Molotov cocktail thrown from the battlements. At worst it'll inspire you to turn up your Rage Against the Machine and rail against ""the Man""; at best, it will forever change the way you think about violence, oppression, and resistance."

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Incredibly well made.Fantastic.
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"110% masterpiece, and totally relevant to questions presently faced by US policymakers."
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,one of the finest war films ever made. that it was viewed in the Pentagon to generals countering the insurgency is no surprise.....that they ignored even moreso
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"If the current U.S. foreign policy has a warts and all mirror, this is it. Must see masterpiece."
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"An excellent and still timely film about the clash between the west and islam. Even tempered, portraying both sides in shades of grey, its documentary feel is vivid and the performances excellent. One of the best sociopolitical thrillers ever."
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,The Pentagon's seen it... why shouldn't you?
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,One of my favourites. I like everything from the subject matter to the acting and cinetography. Even though it's 40 years old the issues about torture and insurgency seem as fresh as ever.
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"Incredible film. A great document of the Algerian independence movement, and a history lession I wish current regimes took seriously. Although the state department has watched this film at latest back in 2005 when it came to Iraq, it never learned the films lessons I guess."
1.0,tampopo,A series of apparently unrelated and often surreal side dishes complement a charming and lighthearted main course. This film is a zesty and satisfying examination of food and it's role in life and society. Strange and unusual ingredients combine for a surprisingly rich experience. Not to be missed!
1.0,tampopo,Great film! Glad the employee at Barnes and Noble recommended it to me during the last Criterion sale.

1.0,tampopo,Un film à voir obligatoirement. Period.
1.0,tampopo,"An hysterical film that works on many levels. It's purely outrageous at times, and serious social observation at others. Ultimately, however, it's what started my great love of noodles!"
1.0,tampopo,"One of my favorite movies. It's random, idiosyncratic, funny, sad in turns. The basic premise is that a truck driver agrees to train a widow to be one the best ramen chefs in Japan. With many side stories on the role of food in life and how food and sex are intertwined."

1.0,tampopo,"Italy has spaghetti westerns, how about a noodle western from the far East?"
1.0,tampopo,"It's like Bunuel in Japan, though that is not to cheapen its charm by likening it to something else. It has a taste all its own. Satirical and ridiculous, but at the same time strikingly genuine. A comedic masterpiece."
1.0,tampopo,this is just about the best movie ever made.
1.0,tampopo,"Hilarious film about foodies, filmed as a spoof of spaghetti westerns. Some great blackout comedy moments inserted as interludes have nothing to do with the underlying plot. The more you know about Japanese culture, the more you'll understand this film."
1.0,tampopo,Makes me hungry every time I watch it!
1.0,tampopo,â??Elin Melchior:This film focuses on many of the more bizarre aspects of food in Japan. From the search for the perfect bowl or ramen noodles to eating sushi off of a woman's bare stomach. It has to be seen to be believed. ---- Library Description: Film; Japanese Noodle Westernâ??

1.0,tampopo,"food and sex and fun...this quirky little movie is one of my all time favorites that makes just about every other comedy seem a bit drab. Although i fast forward that song every time, the rest is SOOOO good, it still gets 5 stars."
1.0,tampopo,"Surprise, I love food movies! This is my favourite. A japanese obsessional quest of oneself thrue the perfect noodle soup? Beautifull! A main story ponctuated by little clips to the glory of excesses food can you bring to! Moving, funny and profond! Not to miss!"
1.0,tampopo,One of my favorite movies of all time.

1.0,tampopo,Incomparable. Only Juzo Itami could make a fascinating film about ramen.
1.0,tampopo,"An exuberant celebration of food, film, sex and the small yet special moments in one's life. Thankfully, the movie doesn't take itself nearly as seriously as I take it. The ultimate Ramen Western--or the Only Ramen Western."

1.0,wings_of_desire,"""Dedicated to all the former angels"""
1.0,wings_of_desire,"I think I fell in love with this movie first because I desire that it be true, and that the angels in which I do not believe believe in me, and second because it shares an aesthetic I had not yet uncovered in myself. I have often watched the first half alone, in search of solace of an unknown kind."
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Una gran lecciÃ³n de creatividad, profundidad , claridad y osadÃ­a fÃ­lmica. IncreÃ­ble la manera de conjugarlo todo sin raspar los lÃ­mites de la conciencia."

1.0,wings_of_desire,This film is poetry in motion. Breathtaking cinematography and a deeply moving meditation on humanity and the connections we make with each other.
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Probably the best film ever made. Also a record of a city and it's people and culture, West Berlin, that now only exists in the memory of those of us that were there at that time and in this film."
1.0,wings_of_desire,another good movie by Wim Wenders
1.0,wings_of_desire,A beautiful and complex masterpiece. A poetic film that I haven't completely understood yet but I am really looking forward to re-watching it. A worthwhile experience. So meticulously detailed and brilliant use of cinematography.
1.0,wings_of_desire,Wim Wender's offers his audience something of a lesson in Berlin's pyscho-geography alongside perhaps the most haunting protrayl of angels in film.

1.0,wings_of_desire,"Again, Wim Wenders. Great."
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Wim Wenders has such a unique style. He had the visuals down in Paris, Texas, but he really nail everything with this. Very poetic. Whenever I find myself describing this film to someone, I almost want to cry."
1.0,wings_of_desire,good movie and very physiological but few years later Hollywood had to made a remake with Nicolas cage and meg Ryan
1.0,wings_of_desire,Needless to say it haunts more and more at every new viewing.

1.0,wings_of_desire,One of the most beautiful German movies I have ever seen!
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Wim Wenders finds means to say something that could not have been siad otherwise. It's a film about material, immaterial and the relationship in between."
1.0,wings_of_desire,I'd give up forever to touch you.
1.0,wings_of_desire,"The sequence with the author & thinker walking through Berlin, thinking about the damaged city along with the love vested in the color portion with the trapeze dancer are two points of extremely distinct grace that are surprising to find in one film."

1.0,wings_of_desire,A truly amazing piece of cinema.
1.0,wings_of_desire,Fantastisk! Betongpornografi.
0.0,wings_of_desire,"This is the dumbest movie I've ever seen. I turned it off after 20 minutes of ""dummes, belangloses Zeug"". I'm not interested in hearing people's inner thoughts or to angels speak calmly about ""becoming humans""."
1.0,wings_of_desire,possibly my favorite all time film
1.0,wings_of_desire,watched this yet again last night because i just recently got it on criterion collection blu-ray. among the greatest ever.
1.0,wings_of_desire,"In many ways, the finest film of the 80's...perhaps ever."
1.0,wings_of_desire,i love this movie it so good
0.0,wings_of_desire,"Apparently, this is a classic. I actually fell asleep whilst watching it and woke up to find - to my disappointment- that it was still on. A shame, as Wender's 'Paris Texas' is one of my favourite films."
1.0,wings_of_desire,A very moving elegy about the yearnings of all of the inhabitants in a divided world. It's also one of the most truly romantic films I seen in how an angel is willing to give up his wings and immortality to be with the woman he loves. A film that truly stays with you.
1.0,wings_of_desire,The true value of the gift of humanity is both a sadness and a joy. (Wim Wenders is quickly becoming one of my new favorite filmmakers.)
1.0,wings_of_desire,Its film or poetry? I never felt this feeling before.........thank you Wenders
1.0,wings_of_desire,"It's not a film for everyone. Too artsy for some and too slow for others, but if you give it a chance, you're in for one of the finest films from any country, in any language. I didn't get into it at first, but once I started to understand this world of angels, it really started to grab me."
1.0,wings_of_desire,its an out of the world movie!! an outstanding experience!!
1.0,wings_of_desire,My all-time favorite film.
1.0,wings_of_desire,i say only one thing: scene in library!
1.0,wings_of_desire,A grand reunification tale.
1.0,wings_of_desire,Very few scenes ever captivated me more than watching the late Solveig Dommartin swinging herself with such enchantment in the trapeze while being watched by an angel in black and white.
1.0,wings_of_desire,Not so much a movie as it is a visual experience. It takes a director with real talent to create real emotions without having to use dialogue. Wim Wenders is that talent.
1.0,wings_of_desire,"beautiful film with a beautiful story, beautiful cinematography, beautiful words, beautiful style, and beautiful scenes.,Why am I me and why not you? Why am I here watching this movie and why not there doing something else? sure god couldn't have been more nicer to me.."
1.0,wings_of_desire,"a beautiful, mesmerising, haunting, lovely, poetic film that captivates you from the start. Bruno Ganz is perfect as the Angel who falls in love with a mortal.  Peter Falk adds an extra dimension - a great addition to the film."
1.0,wings_of_desire,Just saw this on the big screen for the first time. Love it.
1.0,wings_of_desire,This film is indescribable. Just reading the director's original pitch barely does the film justice. It has to be experienced.
1.0,wings_of_desire,"One of my all-time favorites. It's definitely the sort film that has to be watched without distraction and if you are looking to be spoon-fed a storyline, I'd keep looking. It's the sort of film that drifts, leaving it up to you to follow along."
0.0,wings_of_desire,The German version of City of Angels. I skipped and forwarded my way through it. Some poignant moments and I do understand what they were trying to do. I like the fact that it makes you feel for the struggles of mankind without the sappy ending.
1.0,wings_of_desire,Second best movie of all history
1.0,wings_of_desire,If I ever see this again I'm sure I will like it even more. The arthouse style is not that familiar to me so it took some time to get used to the pacing and style. The only thing that bothered me was Marion's monologue in the end. Seemed misplaced a bit.
1.0,wings_of_desire,the closest i've seen film come to poetry

1.0,wings_of_desire,a sweet analysis of human complexity
1.0,wings_of_desire,"It's one of those films that is both artsy AND really cool. It even has a Nick Cave cameo. It was remade into City of Angels, only with all the cool stuff removed."
1.0,wings_of_desire,Beautiful. Achingly beautiful. All elements of this movie come together and present a wonderful celebration of life and all the little simple great things about it.
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Formidable, magnifico, an fear and any other words that come to mind in any country."
1.0,wings_of_desire,A haunting and atmospheric masterpiece. This film gets you into the head of an angel. It really makes you rethink all of the glorious little details of life. I loved it.

1.0,wings_of_desire,Beautiful. Moving. Unique. Impressive.
1.0,wings_of_desire,"And elegiac masterpiece about as simple and complex a subject as what it means to exist in time, or, essentially, what is to be human. A film so rich that one viewing could never do it justice. Brilliant."
1.0,wings_of_desire,One of the great poetic experiences in the history of the cinema!

1.0,wings_of_desire,Peter Falk is cooler than the Fonz in Wim Wender's materpiece
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Lo mejor de todo es la lentitud con que Wim Wenders muestra lo sienten y piensan los personajes. Y despuÃ©s de mostrarlo cuenta, tambiÃ©n sin prisa, lo que quiere contar."

1.0,wings_of_desire,"es impresionante la mirada de Wenders acerca de la humanidad, de la vida en sÃ­ misma .... su cine es muestra de un cariÃ±o por los pequeÃ±os detalles y las grandes casualidades. Lo dice todo con ""Ich weiss jetst, was kein Engel weiss""... una oda a la vida"

1.0,wings_of_desire,"Its hard to explain, but this film was great. It just grabs you and pulls you into this world. A very poetic, thought-provoking, hypnotic film experience."
1.0,wings_of_desire,A beautiful film. The constant camera movements capture a sureal and unearthly character which was perfect for the film. Nothing about the black and white to colour and back feels trite. Everything about it works in every way. Could have easily been boring but instead is pure genius.
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Es ist nicht die Romantik des Films Ich liebe die meistenEs ist die Art, wie sie kÃ¶nnen eine Verbindung mit Menschen und wie sie erreichtMenschen Gedanken"
1.0,wings_of_desire,"If you have seen this movie and don't love it, you're an ignorant douche."

1.0,wings_of_desire,"I don't believe that he wanted to be a human only because of her. It was also because of colors, scents ... But in fact, I don't like it only because of the film itself, but rather because of some kind of personal reasons."
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Deep happiness. My best viewing was at the premiere in Copenhagen, where the film was subtitled with *three* lines in stead of two. The best translation of the poetic core I have seen."

1.0,wings_of_desire,Nick Cave was a nice surprise oh and it was a beautiful film
1.0,wings_of_desire,"I love this movie--it's moving and surreal and City of Angels is only superficially a ""remake"" of it. Los Angeles is not a stand-in for Berlin at the eve of the fall of the wall."

1.0,wings_of_desire,"A fascinatingly inscrutable parable...in this movie you will be a bystander, looking through a window, with your own thoughts and ideas a part of the movie, not the other way around. If you're not ready to go there, don't bother watching."

1.0,wings_of_desire,If I crashed on a deserted island and managed to save the DVD reader this is the movie I wish to have with me!
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Yep. Still love it. Still love Peter Falk, still love Wim Wenders, still love it. Even the long talkey scenes. And the DVD has the deleted pie fight scene, which even cracks Wenders up. That's worth the price of admission alone."
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Great cinematography especially in the library (is that me being biased?) and Nick Cave crops up in it, and columbo. Prefer the black and white but thats just me. Going to watch to Faraway so close soon despite its u2 connections."

1.0,wings_of_desire,"In my top 5 since I first saw it, as I grow older it has supplanted others as probably my favorite of all. Beautiful, thoughtful, hopeful, poetic. Perfect."

1.0,wings_of_desire,Exquisite. Some films are perfect. How anyone was persuaded to try the dire copy 'City Of Angels' is beyond me. Sureley they know that re-make was a suicide mission.

1.0,wings_of_desire,"This was a great movie! It's very slow-paced, which suits me. It's consistent within its rules, too. And when the recent variation came out, this one seemed only so much better. I love Meg Ryan and I like Nicholas Cage but... yeesh. Someone should smack the writers hard."

1.0,wings_of_desire,for those who still wonder who they are and what they are
1.0,wings_of_desire,What made the creators of City of Angels think they could do better than this wonderful movie? Wings of Desire is beauty in all ways.
1.0,wings_of_desire,"The movie is patient and complete. Wonderful. I still wonder ""Why am I me and why not you? Why am I here and why not there? When did time begin and where does space end?"""
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Wenders will never be able to do better than this. Yet, this work is highly underappreciated. Shame."
1.0,wings_of_desire,a beautiful movie that hollywood tried to rip of and failed miserably...there's a surprise
1.0,wings_of_desire,Realistic hope meets passionate humanity in a magically realistic portrait of angel-as-human. Wenders is a genius.
1.0,wings_of_desire,"I think I fell in love with this movie first because I desire that it be true, and that the angels in which I do not believe believe in me, and second because it shares an aesthetic I had not yet uncovered in myself. I have often watched the first half alone, in search of solace of an unknown kind."
1.0,wings_of_desire,This movie captures the poetic meditative pace that our human brains are wired to resonate in. One of my favorites for the duration.

1.0,nosferatu,Classic Absolute without more.
1.0,nosferatu,Best 1st of the classic monsters even Coppola can't remake but he did a good job the original is far more creepy
1.0,nosferatu,"Horror movies ground zero, I know Caligari came first, but nothing beats an old horror character. One of the best silent movies I have ever seen, the film have an erie mood with a painting kind of impression, making the horror experience even better."
1.0,nosferatu,Great Movie. One of the best.
1.0,nosferatu,"A classic movie introducing many filming techniques used in horror to this day. This movie also has a swapped gender role story line, which is very far ahead of its time. All together, it is an important movie in its themes and its cinematography."
1.0,nosferatu,"A true gothic story, Nosferatu is full of eeriness and has a chilling performance from Max Shreck"
1.0,nosferatu,"10 out of 10:Nosferatu may be a silent film, but it still manages to be creepy with its great set design and makeup and a nice feel."
1.0,nosferatu,"i'm pretty sure the simply fact that a 16 year old boy in 2016 genuinely enjoys this film, i DEFINITELY a good sign"
1.0,nosferatu,"One of the best films of all time, it was a master piece shot in the style of German Expressionism. It utilised several techniques such as stop motion and foreshadowing. The story itself was a loose adaptation of Dracula though the creepy effect is still haunting even till today."
1.0,nosferatu,"It is incontestably a historical piece of cinema, the birth of the vampire in popular culture as well as a great example of the German Expressionist moviment. A classic of the classics. 5/5 stars"
1.0,nosferatu,"This timeless horror classic is scary, but enjoyable to watch and is better than lots of horror films today. I could watch this a thousand times and it would still be creepy. This masterpiece has great music, great actors, and it lives up to its eeriness to this day."
1.0,nosferatu,Went to see it with my boyfriend and they had a live band playing for the sound. It was amazing!
0.0,nosferatu,although I highly respect it as it's probably the first ever horror movie and it was extremely groundbreaking I personally found it quite boring and not enjoyable
1.0,nosferatu,"Nosferatu is a classic Horror-film, with iconic scenes and one of the best Horror-movie antagonists. Nosferatu is a great film with a good tragic ending, and deserves five stars."
1.0,nosferatu,"Classic horror, the first vampire film."
1.0,nosferatu,"One of the finest of the silent era, Nosferatu remains an influence to the horror genre thanks to its gritty feel and creepy performance by Max Schreck that still delivers some chills even after many years!!!"
1.0,nosferatu,"I used to be scared by his face as a kid. I grew out of that and now I realize that its a great movie and its legitimately creepy, especially for the time"
1.0,nosferatu,beats the hell out of alot of movies nowadays
1.0,nosferatu,Shrek's terrifying disposition as Nosferatu adds a whole new layer of horror. Murnau is in top form as always. The visuals and tight structure are to be revered and are frequently mimicked in modern horror with good reason.
1.0,nosferatu,Stephanie Meyer needs to watch this!!
1.0,nosferatu,"Amazingly eerie and frighteningly alive despite the limitations of this silent era of filming. I am a lover of all things horror, and this movie fit the bill very well. The creepiness of Nosferatu still works even in 2014, where there is a high standard for horror."
1.0,nosferatu,"90+ years old and still the best version of *coughs* Dracula to date - startling use of shadows and negative photography, and Max Shrek is still bloody terrifying!"
1.0,nosferatu,very cool to see something that old.
1.0,nosferatu,"Wonderfully acted and hauntingly shot, Murnau's horror epic still retains its power nearly 100 years (!) after it was made. Hilariously, considering the circumstances under which it was made, it also might be the best film adaption of ""Dracula"" to date."
1.0,nosferatu,"It's a classic, what's not to love."
1.0,nosferatu,"Schreck plays the eponymous vampire with an almost savage simplicity, and teamed with Murnau's striking and frightful visual storytelling created some of cinema's most lasting and haunting imagery. While not out and out terrifying, Nosferatu is eerily spooky and chilling."
1.0,nosferatu,One of the greatest horror films of all time.
1.0,nosferatu,I Loved It! I've always Wanted to see it and I Personally Love Max Shreck's Creepy Performance! Its Hard To Believe that He was one of those Actors that couldn't get out of character! Fantastic!

1.0,nosferatu,"Creepy, beautiful and groundbreaking."
1.0,nosferatu,A true classic of the silent era
1.0,nosferatu,"It's the one that started it all. Five stars in the bank. Of course, I have to admit that this was just a bit more enjoyable watching in the context of John Malcovich's and Willem Dafoe's wonderful interpretation, ""Shadow of the Vampire""."
1.0,nosferatu,95% The makeup for Nosferatu is astounding for a film this old.
1.0,nosferatu,Bram Stoker's Dracula in a German silent film with Hans Erdmann doing the score is the ideal combination for instant horror success. Vampire culture meets the big screen for the first time in this historic gem. Look for this online as it will be hard to find.
1.0,nosferatu,"I think it's incredible how this film can truly scare without the use of any sound. The German Expressionist sets are great as well. The iconic use of shadow is great. This was the first silent film I ever saw, and it was an excellent experience."
0.0,nosferatu,"Nosferatu was creepy, but oh my god was it a boring movie. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was scary for it's time, but my was it boring."

1.0,nosferatu,"Among the significant classics of silent cinema, Nosferatu sets the standard for modern horror films with its spooky, gothic atmosphere and a frightening performance Max Schreck."
1.0,nosferatu,"Scary and masterful, Nosferatu is probably the most influential Horror film ever made. This is the real first adaption of Bram Stroker's Dracula and is the best adaption too. Max Shrek makes a frightening performance as Count Orlock. Nosferatu is the best Horror film ever made."
1.0,nosferatu,"Dark, terrifying, and brillianly filmed"
1.0,nosferatu,"If you're into horror, or silent films; this is a must see! Excellent FX too."

1.0,nosferatu,One of the best films in movie history. Very creepy. A classic!
1.0,nosferatu,Creepy vampire movie...I think it's because it is a silent movie.

1.0,nosferatu,Still the most legitimately frightening movie vampire.
1.0,nosferatu,"Easily one of the most memorable horror films from the silent era, Nosferatu is one of the greatest adaptions of Bram Stoker's Dracula - even if it wasn't technically legally adapted - especially thanks to Schreck's unforgettably frightening performance as the vampire himself."
1.0,nosferatu,"The classic 1922 vampire that created a memorial film genre is amazing with the directorial work of F.W. Murnau, and Max Schreck's performance as Count Orlok."
1.0,nosferatu,"Perhaps the most iconic film in classical horror, Nosferatu sends audiences to all kinds of different dimensions of filmmaking techniques with this imaginative vampire story."

1.0,nosferatu,"One of the scariest movies I have seen in black and white. I liteally got scared. I was surprised by how scared I got during a silent movie, now that's bad ass. It's a good movie.

0.0,sing_street,"This film made predictable, lame choices throughout that turned what could have been an excellent movie into a gross exercise in how to please a dumb crowd. Also the songwriting was largely cliché-filled and boring."

1.0,sing_street,Just a really irresistibly watchable movie. Never really stopped smiling or tapping my toes.
1.0,sing_street,"Watch this on Netflix right now! The music was great! The story was powerful and fun. The same people also did Once (another great movie, though might require VidAngel for some). We enjoyed it a bit more once we turned on the English subtitles as their Irish accents can be a bit strong at times."
1.0,sing_street,the movie itself is just 4/5 stars but the original songs written for this movie are exceptional and really put this movie over the top
1.0,sing_street,"kind of reminds me of ""the commitments"" and school of rock"
1.0,sing_street,As poignant as it's written and as heart-felt as it's performances I fell in love with this movie from the start of the first song. Maybe it's because I'm a sucker for coming of age stories but this one really touched me right in the feels.

1.0,sing_street,One of the best movies I've ever seen. Deep emotions and power of friendship.
1.0,sing_street,"My face hurts from smiling. Yes, this is a nostalgia trip for folks of a certain age, and the plot is well-trod territory. But it has limitless charm and heart, and is accompanied by a deliriously infectious soundtrack."
1.0,sing_street,I hate the fact that John Carney knows everything I want in a feel good musical. Because of this I have yet to be disappointed in his films.
1.0,sing_street,"A pretty awesome movie wich makes you feel good... it's awesome the way they can make you feel envolved with the characters, i think this movie deserves an especial mention to evocate the other people to see it"

1.0,sing_street,Simplemente el coming of age de nuestros tiempos sólo el tempo definirá si queda como un gran clásico.
0.0,sing_street,"I must be missing something with this: it's the law of decreasing returns as John Carney turns in another same but different tale of musical dreams, but none of it rang true."
1.0,sing_street,"A movie that inspires, awes and pleases all at once. Sing Street achieves with a very modest budget what many movies don't even hope to achieve."

1.0,sing_street,"If you're going to follow-up sleeper hit and Broadway sensation ""Once"", you'd better be original, fun, dramatic ... romantic, and a lot nostalgic. This musical hits all the right notes and all the right moves. Happy sad ... but mostly happy."

1.0,the_kid_with_a_bike,"Simple tale with satisfied execution, The Kid with A Bike is deeply inspiring film about the power of random act of kindness. The whole of those things geniusly wrapped by Dardenne's original style which makes this drama more attractive and realistic."

1.0,the_kid_with_a_bike,"At first, I thought Cyril was a hard headed boy who will never change but thanks to Samantha's perseverance, it changed my view of Cyril. I guess Samantha reminded me of God, always willing to take a chance on any lost soul. I recommend this movie."
1.0,the_kid_with_a_bike,"This is one to see for sure. A story of rejection and adoption that is amazing. Don't let the fact that its a French film hold you from seeing this one. Great performance by the kid and the hairdresser. This movie is tightly made as well, which I appreciate. 95 of 100."
1.0,the_kid_with_a_bike,"remarkable film abot human feelings, relation and hope."

1.0,the_kid_with_a_bike,My faith in humanity is restored.
1.0,the_kid_with_a_bike,such a difference between hollywood and the rest. This movie is so deep and yet tears and overdramatic scenes are left out so the audience has the overwhelming plot all for them to process. Simply excellent.
1.0,the_kid_with_a_bike,"Cecile de France must never play a bad person. (see ""A Secret"") The kid is a phenomenon."

1.0,mafioso_1964,"Francis ford Coppola had to watch this film before he started his career, probably Martin Scosese too."
1.0,mafioso_1964,"Underappreciated and neglected mafia film. Francis Ford Coppola borrowed a lot of scenes and ideas from this and used them in his 'Godfather' trilogy. So yes, 'Mafioso' is more important than it is made out to be."
1.0,mafioso_1964,One of the best mafia films I've ever seen.
1.0,mafioso_1964,"I like that the focus is less on the hit and more about the land, culture and its people."
1.0,mafioso_1964,"Although the title may be a little misleading as I picked it up thinking it was a gangster film, it is a movie that shows the distancing factors between Northern Italy and Southern Italy. It is more a film about how these people see each other and how different they seem to be to each other."
1.0,mafioso_1964,"Movie is from 1962. I thought it lived up to they hype, and it travels in remarkable directions."

1.0,400_blows,4/4--This film is so brilliant that I don't consider it a movie. Its a piece of the human soul that everyone can relate to.
1.0,400_blows,Truffaut is an all out genius. An incredibly heartfelt and relatable French New Wave masterpiece.
1.0,400_blows,"Part a homage to childhood (similar to Amarcord) and part a critique of French society, this masterpiece chronicles the gradual descent into delinquency of a normal, bright boy."
1.0,400_blows,One of the best final shots of ever.
1.0,400_blows,One of the best final shots of ever.

1.0,400_blows,truffaut e la sua infanzia...che gioia vedere l'immensitÃ  del mare
1.0,400_blows,Truffaut's masterpiece. Personal and simple story...
1.0,400_blows,Sincerity and Validity.
1.0,400_blows,This movie broke my heart!Funny that this one is so sad and intense and the others are comedies.
1.0,400_blows,"The first time I saw this it was in a double bill with Jules and Jim.I like Jules and Jim, but this film affected me on a personal level. I completely related to the character of Antoine Doinel. One of Truffaut's best."
1.0,400_blows,poignant.very very poignant..probably the closest CATCHER IN THE RYE adaptation i could get...
1.0,400_blows,This is one of those movies that just makes you go wow. I was enthralled the whole time and was completely invested in all of the characters. I am very excited to see more of Francois Truffaut's films because quite frankly this movie was amazing.
1.0,400_blows,I know how he feels.
1.0,400_blows,Francois Truffaut...
1.0,400_blows,Fantastic example of awesome cinema. The film is now iconic. I loved the realism of the characters and the places and spaces they inhabited.
1.0,400_blows,They sure don't make them like this anymore.
1.0,400_blows,"Probably the best performance by a kid i've seen in a movie. Leaud is so good, he shows the character's confusion and angst so well. And Truffaut makes the character believable and easy to relate to. The last shot is something that will stay with you and haunt your dreams."
1.0,400_blows,"Review in haiku:French New Wave classic.And today, folks watch Paul Blart.An honest, strong film."
1.0,400_blows,"So sad and so true. This is an honest picture, it shows all sides good and bad. And because it is so fair and so close to home, it's heartbreaking on a very deep and personal level. Anyone who's ever felt alienated by friends and family will understand this movie."
1.0,400_blows,"The French New Wave's crowning glory, this film is one of thee greatest films ever made; I mean that, Truffaut, shows the un-clenching view of society."
1.0,400_blows,Beautiful. I really enjoyed it.
1.0,400_blows,This movie is for pussies.
1.0,400_blows,I really love the few French New Wave films I've watched because they've got the quality of art from the 1920s-30's - it's fresh and iconoclastic -- driven by the pretension of youth. Les 400 Coups is to the New Wave as The Fountain is to Dada.
1.0,400_blows,"Awesome, awesome movie! Love it!"
1.0,400_blows,Wow this is such a great movie.  This is the best forgein film ever
1.0,400_blows,I've seen all the Antoine Doinel films. This one is definitely the best. Love that freeze-frame at the end.
1.0,400_blows,"saw it again this weekends.still felt touched so much by the ending long take.  ""you asked me where I was going.I pointed at the sea"" lyrics of a song being once popular here"
1.0,400_blows,"The 400 blows reminded me once again what it's like to be 13.  Francois Truffaut's first feauture film is not only a staple of French new wave, but also one of the best films ever on adolesence. What beautiful black and white photography!  Masterpiece."
1.0,400_blows,Essential French New Wave - a must see.
1.0,400_blows,A touch arty? Yes. Brilliant.
1.0,400_blows,Cuando el cine francés parecía estar sumido en una crisis temática surge Los 400 golpes de Truffaut. Acertado guión y precisa visión de cómo un niño puede convertirse en criminal. Muy recomendable. Cine de autor 100% puro.
1.0,400_blows,Francois Truffaut's first feature is an haunting and painfully accurate look at adolescence.
1.0,400_blows,"La ""nueva ola"" francesa trajo consigo una revolución en la industria y esta obra maestra de Truffaut. Nuevos objetivos y movimientos de cámara. Cómo olvidar el Travelling en el mar."

1.0,400_blows,"What do you say about a favourite? 'The 400 Blows' makes me want to run through the streets of Paris, and escape to the seaside. I too was young once."
1.0,400_blows,One of the greatest ending scenes of any film. Antoine Doinel is one of the best protagonists of all time. A must-see.
1.0,400_blows,"initially i didn't know what to think of the unusual style of the movie, but careful afterthought made me realize how well done this movie is. definitely worth watching."
1.0,400_blows,it doesn't get more classic than this... powerful french new wave at it's best. stunning black and white with ending to make even a black heart tear.
1.0,400_blows,"very good. even though i still prefer Hiroshima Mon Amour as one of the French Wave firestarters, 400 Blows was still marvelous... and yea, like some say, the last scene was quite something."
1.0,400_blows,Magnifique! Poucos filmes sao tao sinceros.

1.0,400_blows,A magnificent movie by Francois Truffaut.
1.0,400_blows,"One of the very few PERFECT films ever made. Just like Forbidden Games, this film concerns the death of innocence, but The 400 Blows is the seminal film on the subject. One of the top 10 greatest films ever made."
1.0,400_blows,classic piece of french cinema from francois truffaut.
1.0,400_blows,"I don't think Truffaut ever surpassed this one. He came close, but for me the lingering, nostalgic naturalism and sense of childhood's finite nature make this one impossible not to love on a very simple level."
1.0,400_blows,A Forever Young Film. Will never feel old.
1.0,400_blows,Beautiful cinematography and a well made feeling of depression and misunderstanding in this film.

1.0,400_blows,Beautiful and touching movie about a boy who can't find the meaning of life when you're not a kid anymore and you're becoming a man. One of the most powerful ending sequences in the history of cinema.
1.0,400_blows,"B&W;, performance, Montmartre....and so Doinel starts.."
1.0,400_blows,really damn good. hard to believe it was made in the 50s. everything was just so much better than american films at that time.
1.0,400_blows,Paris never look so good
1.0,400_blows,A fantastic display of the juxtaposition between unassuming adolescence and conservative adulthood. Leaud is absolutely amazing!
1.0,400_blows,"amazing. The whole series is good, but this of course is so true, so beautiful and so sad."
1.0,400_blows,"Pour le dernier plan de Jean-Pierre Leo, son regard saisi par Truffaut : libre et blessÃ© Ã  la fois."

1.0,400_blows,"Doesn't lose any emotional power of the years, a masterful debut for Truffaut!"
1.0,400_blows,I extremely remember my childhood when i saw this movie.
1.0,400_blows,French New Wave at its best.
0.0,400_blows,"Ok, it's considered as the origin of the ""Nouvelle Vague"", the main character is Truffault's alter-ego and it was made in the fifties. Although it seemed pointless to me."
1.0,400_blows,Every man who ever and a childhood needs to see this movie.
1.0,400_blows,A fundamental classic for anyone who loves film.
1.0,400_blows,Antoine Doinel's final run to the sea touchs me every time
1.0,400_blows,Fantastic...one of the best foreign films I've seen in a while.
1.0,400_blows,"Superb acting to complement a powerful story. The film makes a clear suggestion that messed up adults create messed up kids. On the flip side, kids can be quite resilient in trying to find ways to survive the mixed messages of the adult world around them."
1.0,400_blows,The only film from the French New Wave I can re-watch. This film affected me the way Catcher in the Rye did for many other folks.
1.0,400_blows,The film that woke me up to cinema when I was a teenage.Thanks PBS!
1.0,400_blows,This is a timeless classic - a beautiful beautiful story of a mischievous young boy deserted by the world (save perhaps his lone friend) who looks for an escape and finds none - the tracking shot followed by the sea and that freeze... unbelievable.
1.0,400_blows,Truffaut lets it all out here. Go Nouvelle Vague

1.0,400_blows,The final scene on the beach is one of the most hearthrobbing and hopeful little piece of art in the whole history of cinema.
1.0,400_blows,"I'm going to avoid name dropping things like ""French new wave"" and such and describe the film as some said it to me.""It's like Degrassi Junior High if Degrassi Junior High was awesome and French and had better music.""I'm inclined to agree."
1.0,400_blows,"La historia es hermosa, la fotorafia de la pelicula igual, me encanta... el final es fasinante... Tru ffaut un gran maestro...!!!!"
1.0,400_blows,My 5th favorite of all time. A beautiful film about a boy pretty much neglected by adults around him. Sounds like my childhood. The ending is one of the most moving I've ever seen.

0.0,station_agent,"contains just about every fucking cliche of a dreary indie film, making the end result a heap of shitness - why The Station Agent ever became so acclaimed is completely beyond me"
1.0,station_agent,Some of the best dialogue to make it a film as it feels more like a well-written short story then just a movie. One of best independent films made in years.
1.0,station_agent,This is the BEST film so far this century. See it once and you'll be hooked for life.

1.0,station_agent,"Loved this movie! the story takes Finn through isolation - into friendship, through disappointment and finally out the other end where he's not afraid any more."

1.0,station_agent,"There really is something to say about quieter movies. The lack of dialogue seems to only bring you in further to the main character's psyche.

1.0,station_agent,una muestra de que la amistad puede ser tan sencilla o compleja como quieras que sea
1.0,station_agent,"The whole is greater than the sum of its parts, with understated, yet fully textured, performances from Dinklage, Cannavale and Clarkson. If it had not been available at my local library I doubt I would have ever viewed it. I would have missed an outstanding film."

1.0,station_agent,"Sublte, Character Driven, Honest and Simple. I also Met Peter Dinklage long after falling in love with thi movie. It was at a dog park."
1.0,dolce_vita,"Mastroianni es genial. Fellini relata la historia (sin historia) de la vida, la ""pasión de la vida"". La belleza inalcanzable de Sylvia, la inocencia inalcanzable de Paola. El vacío del mundo modernos; la esperanza del calor familar de Steiner."

1.0,dolce_vita,"A delicious, European treat, suffused with melancholy, beauty, and complexity."
1.0,dolce_vita,"Much like its contemporary, L'Avventura, La Dolve Vita perfectly captures the ennui and amoral listlessness of the idle rich. Fellini is captivating at his best."
1.0,dolce_vita,"It feels immense, but at the end of the day this is simply about a scared and insecure man's efforts to project false confidence. He keeps his eyes locked on what he believes will satisfy him, only to find that all paths have trials."
0.0,dolce_vita,The most pretentious movie I have ever seen in my life.
1.0,dolce_vita,"A pretty grim and oddly surreal look at the emptiness of wealth and hedonism. Fellini is great as usual here, and I can't help feeling it is a major influence on one of my favorite films, The Great Beauty."
1.0,dolce_vita,A crítica de Fellini ao modo de viver da burguesia italiana no pós-Guerra é duro e claro. E as inovações narrativas só se enriquecem com a fotografia e os figurinos espetaculares.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Fellini brings you to a place which is physically impossible, and he creates this with characters you either love or hate, but you feel from them. The most fun I have ever had in one film in my entire life"

1.0,dolce_vita,La dolce vita [1960]
1.0,dolce_vita,Here is a remarkable creation. I have never come away from a movie feeling so simultaneously fulfilled yet empty. It refracts then reflects the viewers' emotional extremes back onto them in ever-changing ways.
1.0,dolce_vita,"La Dolce Vita portrays blissful ignorance as the truth of tragedy. Elegant and suggestive cinematography, some of Fellini's greatest ideas, and a length not ever overblown or tiresome. La Dolce Vita is definitely an Italian masterpiece."

1.0,dolce_vita,"Can't believe I went this long without seeing it, but there are a few I still haven't seen. It pretty much speaks for itself, but I'm left with the question that if the paparazzi world was this decadent in the 60s, what would Fellini make of it today?"
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini's masterful and stunning portrayal of Italian neo-realism is among his best work. No-one can pull off the classic fountain scene like Anita Ekberg.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Beautiful portrait of decadent disillusionment. Endlessly gratifying visuals, and great performances by all. Touching, sad, heartbreaking, yet exciting, and deeply satisfying, if cynical. Fellini's visions of humanity, and the intricate glories of Rome, and Nico. A great big slice of story."
1.0,dolce_vita,Marcello Mastroianni is my new old movie star crush.
1.0,dolce_vita,One of the best movies ever- period!
1.0,dolce_vita,A must see for any film aficionado!!
1.0,dolce_vita,This movie is the reason i would love to visit Rome someday
1.0,dolce_vita,The most realistically debauched film ever
1.0,dolce_vita,"I have no idea what this film is about, the symbolism of the sea monster in the ending, the g-rated orgy. Maybe it documents the emergence of the paparazzi or the decline of western civilization. The absurd, the absurd. Very postmodern Rome, Very Fellini."
1.0,dolce_vita,"I don't know how to praise it. Each and every part was delightful. My heart- if there is any- watched it, not me."
1.0,dolce_vita,can you believe there are only 12 flixster reviews of this movie?
1.0,dolce_vita,"A more miserable life is better, believe me, than an existence protected by an organized society where everything is calculated, everything is perfect."
1.0,dolce_vita,"Pure Fellini absurdism. The way it was chalked up I was expecting more of the gorgeous Anita Ekberg, but Mastroianni is very magnetic in the film. I was shocked by how beautiful this film was (add another point to bw being more beautiful than color)."
1.0,dolce_vita,Amazing. Everything about this film is right. I love the sense of endless chase. I'm depressed I'll never again get to watch this movie for the first time.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Could be my favorite Fellini. This film is flawless. The story is superb, the details are mind-blowing. It's utterly fantastic. A philosopher's film, for sure."
1.0,dolce_vita,ClÃ¡ssico inconteste de Fellini. Brilhante a atuaÃ§Ã£o de Marcello Mastroiani. Apaixonante do inÃ­cio ao fim.
1.0,dolce_vita,A film that very likely I would see many many times. Beautiful.
1.0,dolce_vita,saw it again: WHAT A MOVIE - I need to revisit other Fellini-movies also - but why was it banned in Spain until 1983?
0.0,dolce_vita,So long. Full of Italian-speak. Surreal imagry that I couldn't figure out. I gave up 2 hours into it. Sorry Fellini. I'd rather take 8 1/2.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Large, satisfying, mysterious."
0.0,dolce_vita,Technically a very good film but far too tedious for me
1.0,dolce_vita,This movie exhibits the manifestation of decadence. It is both quiet and powerful; Fellini's best.
1.0,dolce_vita,"As I had said about Persona, this is one of the few films which I think is perfect. After watching this, I felt like I had just experienced life, hence the title of the movie. The cinematography is enchanting, the acting was as well, and everything about this film was perfect."
1.0,dolce_vita,"""Who is the mother of the sun?"""
1.0,dolce_vita,Masterpiece. The scene with Frankie was one of the best.
1.0,dolce_vita,"""The great thing is to burn, and not to freeze."""
1.0,dolce_vita,"Anita, Marcello, Rome, l'amour, la mort .... quelle beauté, quelle finesse ..."
1.0,dolce_vita,"Not only one of my personal favourites, but also undeniably one of the best movies of all time. Three hours of pure art."
0.0,dolce_vita,"2H40 c'est long. Tres long. Surtout lorsqu'on regarde un film visiblement tourne sans aucun scenario et qu'avant la sceance, l'ouvreuse vous assure qu'il ne fait pas plus de 2H."
1.0,dolce_vita,"Not for everyone as it is largely plotless, but nonethless it is both mesmirising and memorable. Deserves its classic status."
1.0,dolce_vita,It's like researching for an enormous pile of encyclopedic matters and you conclude on stabilizing weirdness as a norm.And to think paparazzi was made up as a word thanks to this film...
1.0,dolce_vita,"One of my favorites to watch in a dark, quiet room at night...with all of the concentration of a chocolate-buzzed lounging session..."
1.0,dolce_vita,This is a classic and one of the best films made......................
1.0,dolce_vita,"""La Dolce Vita"" e agrodolce."
1.0,dolce_vita,"Fellini was the greatest filmmaker who ever lived. I know that's subjective, but I don't care what anyone else says. If I could never watch another movie but one, it would be this."
1.0,dolce_vita,this movie both colorful and white-black for me.. i love character analyses of FeFe..
1.0,dolce_vita,i thought it was wonderful.
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini is a genius. All eight sequences in this movie stand on their own. The idea that modernism will change man is a fascinating one. This movie seriously changed the way I view movies.
1.0,dolce_vita,It makes it's point so well and so often(too much of a good thing is a bad thing; the disillusionment that comes with excessive decadence.)that it nearly folds over on itself and becomes an example of it's own meaning.
1.0,dolce_vita,"I absolutely love Fellini: Italy, pagentry, blasphemy, sexuality on a grand scale. He is absolutely brilliant and never fails to amuse me. Nino Rotta and the accompanying music is amazing!"
1.0,dolce_vita,"life is excess and excess will eat at your core. fast city living will make you lose your umbrian angel, especially if your prone to the wife/mother/whore syndrome. ain't fellini great?!"
1.0,dolce_vita,"Have a few drinks, sit down and enjoy."
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini's masterpiece paved the way for movies like Lost in Translation by trading typical narrative structure for everyday examination.
1.0,dolce_vita,"This is the first Fellini film I ever saw, and at the time I found it truly astonishing. For me, it was a great introduction to Fellini's world and made me want to see explore his other films. I see it as a sublime European pop epic that needs to be viewed again and again..."
1.0,dolce_vita,"Simply the most amazing movie ever. It will haunt you for the rest of your life. But then, I give myself away..."
1.0,dolce_vita,"not as good as 8 1/2, but the fountain scene is one of my favorite scene of all time"
1.0,dolce_vita,that's innovative cinema! way ahead of its tme. the music score is one oth the best of all times. And Anita Ekberg is definately one of the sexiest women on screen ever!
1.0,dolce_vita,"i liked this more than eight and a half. i don't think it is as daring or visually stimulating, but i had a much better time taking it in. it's three hours of chaos but the scenes are short and clever. and unline the other fellini film i feel like this one had more of a pulse."
1.0,dolce_vita,anything with marcello....sigh
1.0,dolce_vita,Marcello .... mmm...Italian...mmm...Anita ...mmm
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini at his best.
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini...need I say more?
1.0,dolce_vita,Images from this movie never quite leave me. Leave it to Fellini to break the narrative format and create something this incredible. It's the first true character piece but with an epic scope of rome. Fellini could say so much with so little. Gets better every time I see it.
1.0,dolce_vita,"This movie is one of my favorites. The movie was just great, I first saw it in my Italian Cinema class and was completely blown away. Great film."
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini's second best surreal masterpiece
1.0,dolce_vita,"God this movie is great. Fillini's cinema is so expansive and wild, yet the transitions are effortless."
1.0,dolce_vita,Gets better every time I see it.
1.0,dolce_vita,These are the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen!... The eyes of the squid...
1.0,dolce_vita,"A masterpiece. A film that can be seen on so many levels it becomes more like a canvas than a film. Classic and endlessly re-watchable, La Dolce Vita (The Sweet Life) is among the greatest achievements in cinema."
1.0,dolce_vita,"Beautiful performances and gorgeous actors and actresses. Makes you wonder how different and yet similar societies can be across countries and along decades. Bravo Fellini, Bravo!!"
1.0,dolce_vita,"The paparazzi are a bunch of heartless fuckers. Another terribly depressing, terribly brilliant piece from Fellini."
1.0,dolce_vita,"Depressing and haunting, it showcases the perils of a life lead in lust. This movie bites hard, and draws blood."
1.0,dolce_vita,Such a beautiful movie and a wonderful story about trying to find yourself.
1.0,dolce_vita,fellini's masterpiece on the silly accolades we bestow on celebrities
1.0,dolce_vita,Revolutionary -- Fucking fantastic!
1.0,dolce_vita,"Imagenes que quedaran grabadas para siempre en su memoria, una actuacion insuperable a cargo de Marcello Mastroinanni, una cinta construida de manera minuciosa como un exquisito trabajo de relojeria. No hay nada malo en La Dolce Vita."
1.0,dolce_vita,It's funny how this is more relevant today than ever before. You can't doubt the power of Fellini's vision here.
1.0,dolce_vita,"A cinematographic feast in rich, elegant black-and-white. The musical scenes are exquisite. Yvonne Furneaux's eyes almost leap out of the screen. Anita Ekberg makes me think.... Aprhodite."
1.0,dolce_vita,"I would like to be la dolce vita's fly on the roman wall and, maybe, more..."
1.0,dolce_vita,One of the greatest films of ever!
1.0,dolce_vita,quem nao se apaixona pela anita ekberg tomando banho na fontana de trevi tem MUITO do que aprender na vida.
1.0,dolce_vita,This was an amazing movie about exploitation and decadence in the modern world. The soundtrack was good and the acting was incredible.
1.0,dolce_vita,One of Fellini's best...
1.0,dolce_vita,"the languid, sometimes frantic, search for enchantment in the minefield of corruption."
0.0,dolce_vita,"On baille et on s'ennuie avec ce film : pas de dialogue poignant, pas d'effets speciaux, pas de gros calibres,... Fellini aurait du reviser ses classiques americains."
0.0,dolce_vita,"Boring, boring, BO-ring!"
0.0,dolce_vita,"Overated and overlong, it is typically Fellini. Saved only from utter mediocrity by the incredible Marcello Mastroianni and THAT scene with Anita Ekberg, a woman who makes the phrase ""sex-bomb"" seem nuclear powered."
1.0,dolce_vita,"a fellini masterpiece on the personas we create for celebrities, the americanization of europe in the sixties, and so on."
1.0,dolce_vita,second only to 8 1/2
1.0,dolce_vita,only for a select few
1.0,dolce_vita,"whenever I am down, i always think about this movie. It shows that not even in film you get everything you want. Some time we as humans expect everything to come so easily but in reality that doesn't always happens. Fellini is such a master and I will always look up to him."
1.0,dolce_vita,"Anita Ekberg, Marcello, Fellinin, need I say more?"
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini's Masterpiece
1.0,dolce_vita,"Huipputyylikas elokuva, josta loytaa joka katsomiskerralla uutta. Ja se oinen Rooma..."
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini will blow your mind.
1.0,dolce_vita,A great film from the Director-Actor duo Fellini and Mastroianni. Must watch for any serious student of cinema.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Always felt like a bad film buff for having never seen this one. Seen a lot of Fellini, but somehow always managed to skip passed this one.How do you not fall in love with this film? I don't know."
1.0,dolce_vita,The party scene where Anouk Aimee sits Snaporaz down in the lonely room and talks to him via vents...Dat scene is pretty much OFF DA HOOK.
1.0,dolce_vita,Amazingly ahead of its time--it's hard to believe this was shot in 1959. Still shocking and beautiful (and long).
1.0,dolce_vita,"After watching it twice, and fully understanding it...i can safely say, 5 stars x"
1.0,dolce_vita,My first Fellini Movie and one of my top faves.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Yes the film is long, but Fellini is not one of the world's greatest directors for nothing. Love the edgy style, the incredible b/w cinemography. Its one the great classics, a must see."
1.0,dolce_vita,"A brilliant, haunting, and unique. An amazing Fellini film that I saw when I was younger and really want to watch again."
1.0,dolce_vita,I absolutely love this movie!
1.0,dolce_vita,"A masterpeice. Definetly edgey for 1960. I liked how the story was told by following Marcello from scene to scene rather than a flat, run-of-the-mill story. A great cornerstone for the filmmaking world."
1.0,dolce_vita,Masterpiece 50 years old still 50 years ahead of its time
1.0,dolce_vita,"A classic masterpiece! Almost half a century on, it is still so relevant! The easy-going lifestyle of urban young elite, without any depth in relationships, looking for some extra fun, but the morning light brings only dissappointment..."
1.0,dolce_vita,"very impressive, makes you think about lots of things"
1.0,dolce_vita,"I really find amazing how the characters of Dolce Vita are never ready to make a full decision on something. At the same time, their efforts for communication are always uncomplete. Aren't these describe our life, with many opportunites, the next moment leaving us with a bitter sense... Oh Rome!"
1.0,dolce_vita,"This is quite likely my favorite film, period."
1.0,dolce_vita,best fellini!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,dolce_vita,"A Fellini masterpiece. Exuberant and exhilarating. It was both scandalous and thrilling. A smorgasborg of themes reach dizzying heights in this decadent epic dealing with celebrities, paparrazi and debauchery."
1.0,dolce_vita,The best movie of all the times.. Not enough stars to rate this movie
1.0,dolce_vita,"If I had to live in a movie, it would be this one....I know. What does that make me?"
1.0,dolce_vita,Absolutely one of the finest films ever made...
0.0,dolce_vita,"Interesting few film tricks, but mostly long, boring, about nothing, don't bother."
1.0,dolce_vita,This movie left me kind of numb at the end. Almost too much to absorb at once. I love the scene where the balloons follow the clown out of the room. This is a movie I could watch repeatedly and probably never understand fully.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Cynically beautiful, beautifully cynical."
1.0,dolce_vita,"A powerhouse of dialogue, music, humor, sex, and cinematography into one of the most sensual surrealist film. One of the All-Time Best."
1.0,dolce_vita,I can completely relate to Marcello.
1.0,dolce_vita,A mith. Marcello is too sensitive for not recognizing the corruption around him and too smart for not being attracted
1.0,dolce_vita,"The best director from the history made this one for everybody realize that the world is crazy. Marcello Mastroianni in an historica char, a legend scene with Anita Ekber. If shock me in these days, I can Imagine in 50 years ago...."
0.0,dolce_vita,I can never pay attention during this movie. And the presence of Nico just annoys the hell out of me. Not my favorite Fellini.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Stylish, iconic film."
1.0,dolce_vita,I can't really say anything that hasn't been said before. A spot on piece of world cinema directed by a great master.
1.0,dolce_vita,"One of the best movies, but slow and complex. It shares many of the problems we face today with the views of the Italian High society of the 50's. It is a treatise on sociology."
1.0,dolce_vita,Self-loathing has never been so beautiful.
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini's dark side deeply explored. Most people cannot watch this movie. It holds nothing back on the meaninglessness of life. It haunts and haunts you.
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini's dark side deeply explored. Most people cannot watch this movie. It holds nothing back on the meaninglessness of life. It haunts and haunts you.
1.0,dolce_vita,"A miracle of a movie. I won't belittle it by saying more. A film one simply must see (but wait til you are at the age when you start having doubts about the true meaning of life before doing so- even though the film, perhaps rightfully, gives no answer, it will surely feed your own questionings)."
1.0,dolce_vita,"This is exactly the sort of film cinema was invented for, only wish I had seen it years ago..."
1.0,dolce_vita,Seductive and evocative... Its beautiful. I loved this film.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Sad, frustrating, beautiful. Never get tired of this movie."
1.0,dolce_vita,also for fellini...watch more...watch more...
1.0,dolce_vita,Mastroianni was so damn cool! Fellini's characterization of the women in his film is so damn brilliant and the plot structure very inventive. Favorite Fellini film.
1.0,dolce_vita,Seven days and seven nights on the Seven hills of Rome...a scathing indictment of the spiritual decay of the jet-set upper class
1.0,dolce_vita,amazing on so many levels. really one of the best films of all time. and it made me fall in love with marcello. i could say alot more...
1.0,dolce_vita,The only real italian kolossal. For the critic and for the audience. Wanna dance?
1.0,dolce_vita,Beautiful and surreal.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Quite simply the best movie ever made. I could fill my whole list with Fellinis, but I'll settle for this."
1.0,dolce_vita,"This movie is among the top three movies I've seen in my life.Mastroanni beautifully portrays the character Marcello , his likes, dislikes, monotonous parties,sexual encounters and finally the intellectual death....If you watch this movie once you can never forget this stuff in your whole life...."
1.0,dolce_vita,"An erotic, existentialist, and irresistably seductive masterpiece."
0.0,dolce_vita,Worst film I have ever seen. Made me puke.
1.0,dolce_vita,Incredible movie with so much style. A must-see for all fans of the movies
1.0,dolce_vita,This movie makes me feel proud of being italian. A classic that will never die.
1.0,dolce_vita,An amazing film that speaks volumes of the unsatisfiable desires of the human heart.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Fellini, Fellini ,Fellini !"
1.0,dolce_vita,"Probably my favorite. Movie, that is."
1.0,dolce_vita,"A personal top ten, top three actually."
1.0,dolce_vita,Might drag on a bit but that's all part of the fun.
1.0,dolce_vita,I am born 50 years too late!

1.0,dolce_vita,The best italian actor and the best director ever together
1.0,dolce_vita,"The best Fellini's for me, a fannastic portrait of the 60's Rome with great characters"
1.0,dolce_vita,brilliant!!!Marcello Mastroianni as always
1.0,dolce_vita,Le meilleur film de Fellini.
1.0,dolce_vita,one of my favorite films ever. a masterpiece.

1.0,dolce_vita,FELLINI ERES GRANDE!!!!
1.0,dolce_vita,"Ahead of it's time,very Hip, Chic, and I love the language...ciao!"
1.0,dolce_vita,Why does this movie seem more and more relevant? It's a must see every other year or so... just so we can see how far we HAVEN'T come when it comes to the banality of pop culture
1.0,dolce_vita,"This is my FAVORITE film! So compelling, a visual and emotional feast. Bravo Fellini!"
1.0,dolce_vita,"Marcello is fantastic again. Following him around Rome into public and personal scenes is compelling indeed, at times uncomfortable and certainly enjoyable as well."
1.0,dolce_vita,Brilliant Italian classic!
1.0,dolce_vita,the world doesnt make movies like this anymore
1.0,dolce_vita,"MI FAVORITA DE FELLINI. QUIZA LA MAS DESOLADORA. LA DECADENCIA DEL ULTIMO TERCIO, SOBRE TODO EN LA FIESTA, ES ALGO CON LO QUE LAMENTABLEMENTE UNO NO PUEDE DEJAR DE EMPATIZAR."
1.0,dolce_vita,"This is one of my favorite movies and my favorite Fellini flick. Its themes still apply to society 100% today and even more so in America than almost 50 years ago in Italy. Marcello's inner conflicts to me are some of the most interesting ever explored on film. Also, Antia Ekberg is beyond amazing"
1.0,dolce_vita,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini is a genius and Marcello Mastroianni could be the coolest man to ever walk the earth
1.0,dolce_vita,nothing sexier than italian cinema than Mastriani in this film-
1.0,dolce_vita,"The best movie from Fellini. Although the story might seem to be tedious, we saw Fellini`s trasforming. His spirit was so connected with Marcello destructed and evaporated."
1.0,dolce_vita,"The most brilliant insight portrait of Italy, in Rome, at the end of the ""roaring '50s"", between gossip, celebrities, and fashion. A masterpiece wonderfully directed by Federico and interpreted by Marcello Mastroianni, his alter-ego on the screen!"
1.0,dolce_vita,"Fucking brilliant from beginning to end. And it's so beautiful, you might not notice that this film is really a condemnation of idolatry in the modern world."
1.0,dolce_vita,I love it. A true great. They just don't make em like this anymore.
1.0,dolce_vita,"A triumph of Italian cinema and one of Fellini's best. After watching it I became oddly attached to it, especially to Marcello."
1.0,dolce_vita,One of the best films ever made.
1.0,dolce_vita,Fucking brilliant. See it.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Boobs. Glorious, gigantic boobs. Redefined the boob film. Also, Marcello Mastroianni and the origin of the Paparazzi."
1.0,dolce_vita,This movie has it all and defines everything that was sexy and wonderful about Roma (and Italy) in the late 50s/early 60s.
1.0,dolce_vita,"OÃ¹ l'on se demande oÃ¹ peut bien aller JÃ©sus, qui passe dans le ciel..."
1.0,dolce_vita,True movie magic bliss. Has an endless list of memorable scenes. Fellini at the top of his game.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Lo mejor es esa fiesta media sordida-vip, media surrealista, media patetica, esta pelicula me da la sensacion de estar durmiendo, se parece mucho a los suenos q tengo. 50 anos y sigue haciendo sentido la decadencia y el glamour. Amo a Marcello, esta muuuy weno."
1.0,dolce_vita,I know that 8 1/2 is great but I'm still partial to La Dolce Vita. It's downright magical.
1.0,dolce_vita,May be my favorite film of all time.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Is this movie really 3 hours long? It positively whizzes by. And how can a black & white movie seem so colorful? Oh, and the Nino Rota score -- this one makes the Best of All Time list."
1.0,dolce_vita,It took me some time to trully appreciate how incredible this movie and how many memorable scenes it contains!! LOVE IT
1.0,dolce_vita,just about everything in this movie makes it worth watching... all its strong and weak points (in any opinion) make it unforgettable
1.0,dolce_vita,This is a wonderful film about the sweet life and how fucked up it makes people.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Don't complain about it being slow, it's done in neo-realist style. It's perfect, (Think of this as a great cup of coffee, and 8 1/2 will be your cigarette). And if you didn't leave the film feeling empty and lost, you didn't watch it correctly."
1.0,dolce_vita,Is it Rome? Is it Fellini? Is it Mastroianni (as a journalist)? Or is it simply Anita Ekberg in one of the most famous scenes in movie history?
1.0,dolce_vita,Great script and direction. Marcello is wonderful. Anita looks so sexy in this film. Very unusual and absorbing film.
1.0,dolce_vita,i want to have an espresso and swim in the treviso-fountain with this cool guy carrying me out of the water smoking an of course dry cigarette...
1.0,dolce_vita,"the characters, the black and white shots make this movie unforgettable."
1.0,dolce_vita,"This tremendous movie, full of noise and spectacle, is a well thought-out utterance which provokes very serious thought. The movie I most want to watch again and again until I understand everything. Plus, Ekberg. Oh, and Marcello."
1.0,dolce_vita,An amazing Fellini film.
1.0,dolce_vita,Wonderful. Mesmerizing. A Classic and an iconic film. It deserves it.
1.0,dolce_vita,"you can always enjoy good music, food and girls...make sure you have at least one good suit!"
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini is probably a man with an eye in the future 50 years before...
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini is so awesome that he's been turned into an adjective (much like Steven Segal). He's not all whimsical and surreal. This message of the movie is pretty grim. We're all fucked. In Italian. With Fountains and cleavage. See it!
1.0,dolce_vita,Perhaps the greatest film ever made
1.0,dolce_vita,What stikes me about this movie is that is amazingly up to date...
1.0,dolce_vita,"Fontana di trevi, know who doesn't wanna swim there??"
1.0,dolce_vita,apperently recreating the fountain is illegal-who would have guessed?
1.0,dolce_vita,There aren't enough adjectives to describe this film. Bravo!
1.0,dolce_vita,NO NEED TO SAY AGAIN.... ROME ROME ROME!!!!!
1.0,dolce_vita,see it on the big screen if you can is all I can say. It's the most lively tragic film ever to come from Italy; Fellini could have only topped himself with 8 1/2. Those who can't stand the papparazzi would do well to see the coining of the term here with a character named Papparazzo
1.0,dolce_vita,One of the few very magical films. Recommended for all to see.
1.0,dolce_vita,"As in most of Fellini's films, you can't stop smiling and being sucked into the circus of his characters and their scenarios. Light never looked so good."
1.0,dolce_vita,"Very surreal movie watching experience. It's like an amazing party that goes on for way too long -- you're tired, you want to go home, but you can't shake the feeling that you'll remember the night for the rest of your life."
1.0,dolce_vita,Great Flick. Very haunting and unreal feeling. Especially Mastrioni's lonely et confident expressions. I love this one.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Enfin réussi à le voir en entier en une seule fois. Film déroutant et passionnant, sa structure me plaît beaucoup, réalisation et interprétation sans faille."
1.0,dolce_vita,"Fellini is brilliant, always. This is one of his must see films. MUST SEE."
1.0,dolce_vita,perfect . need say no more -- real filmaking
1.0,dolce_vita,You canno't forget any of the marvellous scenes from this neo realistic expression of Italia....
1.0,dolce_vita,Anita Eckberg. Cloning was invented for just such occasions.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Great, Giant,,,masterpiece..."
1.0,dolce_vita,"Master Fellini at his best. The glamour of another era in the world and filmmaking is present in this masterpiece, showing the decadence of the elite in a superb way. Mastroiani and Anita Eckberg are one of the greatest couples in cinema's history. Brilliant."

1.0,the_bands_visit,"This DVD sat on my shelf for a week because I wasn't into a subtitled movie, but once I actually started it, there's very little reading and the subtitles really do pull you into the moment. Lots of interestings characters here and a few laugh-out-loud moments as well. A very poignant movie."

1.0,the_bands_visit,"I can't believe so many people don't want to see it, hah. This was a truly beautiful movie. It has a lot of heart and emotion, far better than any recent popular Western movie I have seen. The actors are great and very real. Good for anyone with a taste for indie films."
1.0,the_bands_visit,A beautiful film that captures the art of silence and sound extremely well. The acting is brilliant with moments between each actor that say multitudes with a slight smile or a turned head. The film finds joy and profound sadness in the simplest of moments. A must see.
1.0,the_bands_visit,This was great.. I dont think I have ever laughed more in a movie more than I did in this one. One of the best I've ever seen. A benchmark for foreign films.

1.0,the_bands_visit,See this movie! See it! I laughed out loud several times and smiled out loud the whole time. It's like if Wes Anderson directed once. Sort of like if Wes Anderson combined once with The Life Aquatic.

1.0,the_bands_visit,"Very funny, in a quirky sort of way."
1.0,the_bands_visit,"I loved this movie. This is a quiet, sad, and funny funny funny movie. To top it off, it's all wrapped up in a scathing indictment of the way society has arbitrarily decided to divide itself up."

1.0,the_bands_visit,"Beautiful film about bonding and life. There is good humor, typical of many Middle East films, and some rather deep moments as well (the clarinetist is looking to finish his concerto and gets some beautiful insight from his host).  I love this movie and recommend it - lots to glean from its story."
1.0,the_bands_visit,Wonderful. Hilariously funny yet poignant. Political by being apolitically human

1.0,the_bands_visit,"This movie was a total delight and deeply moving. Arab men can be cute and vulnerable. Set in Israeli suburbia, which seem as soul destroying as the oz burbs, 8 men get lost and then find themselves. See it."

1.0,the_bands_visit,Lovely. And nice music.
1.0,the_bands_visit,a brilliant movie about cultural differences & tolerance. the type of humour is very similar to the one of Czech movies. you just can't keep your face straight even though the situations seem simple and not funny at all. one of the best movies ive recently seen.

1.0,the_bands_visit,The movie presents in a very sensitive way and delicate humor the meeting between two cultures- great movie

1.0,the_bands_visit,A great movie showing the differences between Israelis and Egyptians in a ludicrous way.
1.0,the_bands_visit,"Cute, sentimental, soulful..great movie of 2008. He's got the Wes Anderson-like style which can be kind of slow, but adds a certain comedic effect and allows you to take the time to really get into it. I really liked it- a great movie."
1.0,the_bands_visit,"Nearly perfect...moody...sexy...humane...the only thing wrong with it is the final music performance that too quickly gets glommed over with end credits. but otherwise an optimistic companion piece to the best foreign fim of the last decade, ""the lives of others."""

1.0,the_bands_visit,"Heartwarming, funny, moving, visually striking. I recommend it highly."

1.0,throne_of_blood,Simply the best adaptation of the classic Shakespeare play.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"10 out of 10:Beautifully filmed, well acted, and exciting, Throne of Blood makes the best adaptation of MacBeth."
1.0,throne_of_blood,One of the best Shakspearean adaptations takes place in feudal Japan. It's impossible to take your eyes off this awe-inspiring masterpiece.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"My second Kurosawa film based on a Shakespearean play. As much as I loved Ran, this i felt was better acted and flowed better as a film."
1.0,throne_of_blood,I shall taint these woods crimsom

1.0,throne_of_blood,The film was beautiful!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A masterpiece, both as a Shakespeare adaptation and as a moving drama."
1.0,throne_of_blood,MACBETH WITH SAMURAI COULD YOU ASK FOR A MORE AWESOME MOVIE
1.0,throne_of_blood,Arguably the best adaptation of Macbeth ever made.
1.0,throne_of_blood,this is THE in in only Macbeth Film you habe to watch....
1.0,throne_of_blood,a truly masterful retelling of macbeth.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Brilliant in every way
1.0,throne_of_blood,Throne of Blood is my very own introduction to Shakespeare though not the first. The combination of Kurosawa and Mifune is simply unbeatable!
1.0,throne_of_blood,When my literature class of emo-flunkies rates this B&W; 1957 Shakespeare film over Branagh and Gibson...you know something's special about it. Kurosawa was never better and Shakespeare was never dignified as much on screen. Sorry Ken & Larry!
1.0,throne_of_blood,Pretty much perfect.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Haunting in the most visually appealing ways with impressive illusive effects seen in Kurosawa's films. Throne of Blood is very dark and spiritual with a great stage play brought to life. Also, and again, Mifune delivers."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"One of the most fresh, intelligent, visually-effective and purely magnificent takes on the old Shakespeare tale of deceit, greed, and bloodthirsty desires. Mifune and Yamada perform in the most striking and memorable way."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"The first time I saw it, at the end--when a certain forest literally started moving--I thought that Mr. Kurosawa had gone and changed the ending to the bard's play."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa is regarded as one of the great filmmakers of all time, and it's easy to see why. This is a majestic, enthralling film that reinterprets Shakespeare's Macbeth as a bold and truly epic Samurai picture. Hands down a contender for the best adaptation of the Bard ever put to film."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Best Macbeth adaptation ever. Should be a classic on everyone's shelf
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa's samurai retelling of Macbeth is brilliantly evocative and legend has it Mifune seriously risked his life making the ending. Repeated viewings make his villainous character appear more sympathetic.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Mifune again is superb as in Seven Samurai. This time the tradgedy of Macbeth translated into the Japanese medium and it is superbly handled. The ending is incredible and the film haunting from start to finish, Kurosawa's vision is beautiful, haunting and epic."
1.0,throne_of_blood,An amazing adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth. Set in feudal Japan with Kurosawa regular Toshiro Mifune masterly taking the lead role accompanied by by equally stunning screen performance by Isuzu Yamada as his wife. The ending has to be seen to be believed and has not been bettered to this day.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa's version of Macbeth---a feast for the eye--wonderful, a perfect movie, and true to the feeling of the original Shakespeare play"
1.0,throne_of_blood,A magnificent adapttion of the Shakespeare`s play!
1.0,throne_of_blood,It´s a must see! It´s shows how silence sometimes speaks louder than any word!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"The best version of any Shakespearian play on film, despite it being Macbeth transplanted to feudal Japan. Amazing in every respect!"
1.0,throne_of_blood,Amazing adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth. Probably a more Shakespearean film than nearly all the traditional movies of the bard's works. Must see.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Along with Seven Samurai, Kurosawa's best."
1.0,throne_of_blood,My only exposure to Shakespeare is through Kurosawa...
1.0,throne_of_blood,THRONE OF BLOOD (1957)

0.0,throne_of_blood,I cared about Macbeth as a tragic figure. Washizu can suck arrow.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A Japanese classic, Kurosawa's adaptation of Macbeth."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"One of the very best Shakespeare adaptations. Akira Kurosawa not only retells the story to perfection but he also blends the themes of the original with his own themes and Japanese history, just as well as he did with his much later film Ran."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"The Shakespearean influence is obviously there, not only in story, but the film itself has a very theatre-esque feeling to it. The ending was fantastic. One of Kurosawa's best films."
1.0,throne_of_blood,A fantastic film adaptation of MacBeth's play in which fog and tangled forest webs emphasize the limits on man's foresight.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Macbeth set in feudal Japan, just brilliant. Mifune, as ever and I loved Isuzu Yamada as Lady Macbeth, still and emotionless steadily egging him on to his doom."
1.0,throne_of_blood,A brilliant adaptation on an epic scale.
1.0,throne_of_blood,The best film adaptation of Shakespeare ever. Incredible film.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"If theres a better film adaptation from a shakespear play (maybe Ran, but its a close call) than throne of bllod, I'd love to see it. Throne of blood is creepy, stunning, and masterfully made. Theres alot of depth behind the main characters, and its not just another re-telling of a shakespear play."
1.0,throne_of_blood,A great adaptation by Kurosawa of MacBeth. This movie will stand alone from other Kurosawa films because it is a different kind of story(with the exception of Ran)from the gunslinger fashioned ronin samurai.
1.0,throne_of_blood,A great adaptation of a great Shakespearian play. Stunning cinematography and acting. Very true to the play with only one significant change in the ending. But the change is (dare I say) better than the original. Recommended for anyone who likes Shakespeare.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Brilliant! Kurosawa's version of Macbeth in a samurai style.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Toshiro Mifune, Isuzu Yamada, Takashi Shimura, and Minoru Chiaki star in one of the many highlights of Akira Kurosawa's career."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"This fast, fun action film from legendary director Akira Kurosawa is a fascinating re-telling of Shakespeare's MACBETH, as set in feudal Japan."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Another masterpiece of a film by Akira Kurosawa. A fantastically unique take on Shakespeare's Macbeth starring the powerful force that is Toshiro Mifune.

1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa never did any wrong when it came to making movies, especially with his favorite actor Mifune on his side."
0.0,throne_of_blood,"As much as I normally love Kurasowa, I just couldn't get through this. Maybe someday I'll give it another chance."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Arguably the finest cinematic adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth and one of Kurosawa's best films.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Better than Shakespeare!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa's best ever ! He highlighted perfectly the mystical dimension of Macbeth.Toshiro Mifune is amazing : a warlord returning from the battlefield to his homeland, fighting against his destiny ; against himself and his own craziness...Untill the end, which is totally apocalyptical."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"You put Toshiro Mifune, Akira Kurosawa, and a Shakespeare story together in a room and it's going to take a lot for it not to be fantastic."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Can Macbeth get any better than this? Loved the scene with the moving forest. Wow.
1.0,throne_of_blood,I love this film!!! There has never been a greater actor than Mifune Toshiro. Shakespeare should be proud.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A bona-fide Kurosawa masterpiece. Epic in its scope, its themes, its origins in Shakespeare and Noh theatre, and its lead performance by the walking supernova himself, Toshiro Mifune."
1.0,throne_of_blood,A brilliant adaptation of Macbeth set in feudal Japan. Incredibly directed by Akira Kurosawa. Absolutely stunning...which is to be expected from Kurosawa.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Probably the best adaptation of Macbeth put on screen. Kurosawa at his greatest and with powerhouse performances. The forest scene is absolutely unforgettable: the Bard would be ecstatic.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Simply sublime Cinema
1.0,throne_of_blood,By far the best version of Macbeth that I have seen. Toshiro Mifune is amazing in this role.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"to be(st ran) or not to be(st throne of blood), this is the question !!!!"
1.0,throne_of_blood,Great Kurosawa movie based on Macbeth. The final death scene was amazing and the special effects of the spirits are really cool too. The acting of Toshiro Mifune is always great. The costumes are pretty amazing too.
1.0,throne_of_blood,questions:you can act with just movement? the directors job is to anticipate human emotion? noh theatre: far is close?
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa turned Shakespeare's Macbeth into an amazing film!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A+. A version of Shakespeare's Macbeth, just in the samurai era."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Possibly the best film adaptation of Shakespeare ever. Definitely the best free interpretation, and the most cinematic."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa's compelling ""samurai"" adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth. This isn't just a typical retelling of the story or a film version of the stage play, this is much more of a character study with surprising depth and motivation. An epic film, in every sense of the word."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa's adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth. Stunning for it's time with a surreal feel to it and a story full of metaphors. A masterpiece.17 January 2009
1.0,throne_of_blood,"That evil spirit in the forest could have suggested Washizu get a divorce, but noooooo"
1.0,throne_of_blood,This is actually the first film by Akira Kurosawa that I have ever saw in my life. Kurosawa brilliantly combines the same human elements of Shakesphere's tragedy MacBeth with Japanese history.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A very moving and intense treatment of Shakespeare's Macbeth. Kurasawa was a master at translating Shakespeare into Japanese culture. Mifune is terrific. Very stylistic, though, and not for everyone."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Best Shakespeare adaptation ever (followed closely by 'Ran'). Mifune's final scenes in the film are cenima at its very finest
1.0,throne_of_blood,Easily the greatest screen adaptation of Macbeth (despite the plot adjustments)
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Not so much a tragedy as it is an unrelenting nightmare. I've always found Toshiro Mifune's acting to be somewhat exaggerated, but here his ferocious paranoia is perfectly suited to the role."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"My personal favorite among Kurosawa's film. Haunting, surreal and nightmarish, this is Kurosawa's darkest film yet. Mifune's best performance in my opinion."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"great atmosphere, love the human pincushion ending"
1.0,throne_of_blood,"If not for ""Seven Samurai"" this would be Kurosawas best film period."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa coordinates the best adaptation of Macbeth on-screen and Mifune is orgiastic in the lead role.What more can you ask when you're watching two legends dancing to the cinematic rhythm?
1.0,throne_of_blood,It's Kurosawa - It's Shakespeare. What else is there left to say!
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa. Mifune. Shakespeare. I don't know what else you want from here. Another one of my undisputed favorites.I wanna be buried with this movie.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Adaptacion cinematografica de ""Macbeth"" (Shakespeare), probablemente la mejor que se haya hecho. El teatro Kabuki y Noh construyen las actuaciones, y la ultima escena es una de las cosas mas impresionantes que un ser humano puede ver."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Greatest film adaptation of MacBeth. Dark and haunting. The visuals will stick with you for a long time.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Macbeth, Kurosawa style. Fantastic."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Akira Kurosawa's outstanding treatment of Shakespeare's MacBeth set in medieval Japan.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa takes Macbeth by the horns and makes it his servant. The master never disappointed.
1.0,throne_of_blood,It's MacBeth with Samurais. It fooking perfect.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Haunting images and wrenching story make this a standout Kurosawa.
1.0,throne_of_blood,this is always worth another viewing!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Need I explain myself? This movie ""Kumonosu jo as it is called in Japanese is Akira Kurosawa's Magbeth! There can be no parellel to kurosawa in film history, and yes, this movie casts Toshiro Mifune."
1.0,throne_of_blood,The best Shakespeare adaptation I've ever seen. Kurosawa at his best without a doubt. The way that Kurosawa compensates for the language problems with the superb and subtle actions is genius.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurasawa directs Mifune in Japanese adaptation of the ""Scottish Play."""
1.0,throne_of_blood,Greatest finale ever? Maybe Mifune's finest performance.
1.0,throne_of_blood,A completely wonderful Shakespearian adaptation. One of Kurosawa's best. Toshiro Minfune is just amazing...as usual.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Throne of Blood is one of the few truly great movies that makes me excited for the possibilities of film rather than depressed at the failures.

1.0,throne_of_blood,One of Kurosawa's best. Possibly the most visceral screen adaptation of shakespeare yet.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"This is Kurosawa's ""Macbeth"" . The language of Shakespeare is missing but the power, evil and terror are there. The ending is jaw-dropping. A reporter asked Mifune how he managed to look so terrified during the final scene. ""Because I WAS terrified,"" he answered."
1.0,throne_of_blood,I have seen many versions of Macbeth. Kurosawa did a wonderful job retelling the story in this samauri tale. Wow! Kurosawa never fails..

1.0,throne_of_blood,"If you have to watch Macbeth, I recommend this version, with all the samurai. Shakespeare should have had more samurai."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Yes. My favorite movie all time.
1.0,throne_of_blood,The visuals alone are worth the watching....
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Oddly, this is a scary-ass interpretation of Macbeth...Isuzu Yamada might be the scariest person in history."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"another unlikely yet fully successful mix. kurosawa's vision of macbeth is, as always, breathtaking."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Hommes trop faibles, femmes trop fortes... le pouvoir n'est jamais dans les mains de celui qu'on croit (Cf RAN pour confirmer cette histoire)."

1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa's Macbeth. Haunting and spectacular.
1.0,throne_of_blood,an obscenely subtle movie - shakespeare in a kabuki mask. one of my fav kurosawa films
1.0,throne_of_blood,Another Shakespeare insipred Kurosawa film.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"One of my favorite Kurosawa films, and one of my favorite Shakespeare adaptations. Maniacal Noh-inspired performances, ultra spooky sets and lighting, and a finale to make one quiver all over, so to speak..."
1.0,throne_of_blood,It's Macbeth in Japan. Phenomenal story and characters. If you know Shakespeare then this film is really fun to watch to see how everything is translated through
1.0,throne_of_blood,Shakespeare in Asia.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Just great shots and superb acting. Best adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth and one of the greatest Movies ever.
1.0,throne_of_blood,The most haunting ghost in any movie shows up here.
1.0,throne_of_blood,My second favorite cinematic adaptation of Shakespeare (right behind Strange Brew).
1.0,throne_of_blood,"This movie is so creepy and good--it's like Shakespeare should have been Japanese. I mean, it's amazing. Superb attention to detail; lots of authentic samurai garb and traditional Japanese music."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Yes it is Macbeth, and yes it is done right. You can really see Kurosawa's experiences as a painter show through in the chase scene with the witch."
1.0,throne_of_blood,awesome play of shadows!!!!!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa doesn't need one more person blowing smoke up his ass, but this is by far one of my favorite adaptations of Shakespeare. If you haven't seen it then you should, if you don't want to see it you're an asshole and should kill yourself."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"The final image of Kurosawa's Macbeth character, played by Toshiro Mifune, captures all that is tragic in the warrior-king. Another of Kurosawa's brilliant war films, Throne of Blood is the best reimagining of Shakespeare to come along until Ran, nearly thirty years later."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa's best film, in my opinion. One of his bloodiest, if not the bloodiest. I saw ""Macbeth"" on stage in London earlier this year and I think ""throne of Blood"" is the definitive retelling of that play. This film is breathtaking!"
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A great chance to see a master filmmaker and a world-class actor change everything you thought you knew about ... well, something that resembles Shakespeare."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Akira Kurosawa directs this amazing retelling of Macbeth. Toshiro Mifune (Washizu) is totally believable as the betrayer, while Isuzu Yamada (as Washizu's wife) is haunting as the distraught wife.There is no better production of Macbeth in any form than this movie."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Without a doubt my favorite Kurosawa film. Has everything that makes him great.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Shot beautifully, the contrasts are unreal, the portrayal of Yama-uba is horrifying. Truly great film."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa likes to create his own tales from others before him, and others do the same with Kurosawa's work, this time, he tackles Shakespeare and Macbeth. This is a fine masterpiece, its a great visual take and a deep powerful take rooted in the annuals of time."
1.0,throne_of_blood,the awesome toshiro mifune turned into a sieve in an amazing ending. great shakespeare!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Welles's was like a bad speed trip- - -sweaty, agit. Polanski gutted it, spilt blood. But Kurosawa, he spooked Macbeth up. Into hallucination, into ghost story, into fever dream. So he wins."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Its a really good and creepy interpretation of Macbeth. Its spooky!!!!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Stunning realisation - the fortress and battles, are stunning, in a typical Kurosawa stylee."

1.0,throne_of_blood,An astounding version of MacBeth. I have my dear brother to thank for introducing me to this master work.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Maybe my favorite Kurosawa film.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa tackles Shakespeare's MacBeth. A precursor to his masterpiece Ran is almost as visceral and intriguing. This is the coldest film I have seen by Kurosawa with one of the most powerful and well executed endings of his whole library.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Oustanding photography and filming
1.0,throne_of_blood,In my opinion this is one of the only two truly great film adaptations of Macbeth.

1.0,throne_of_blood,Great Japanese adaption of MacBeth. This is easily one of Toshiro Mifune's greatest works.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"amazing imagery. Toshiro Mufune finest moment. The ""Lady Macbeth"" character in her kimono slithering about like a snake was also amazing."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"One of the most perfect Macbeths I have ever seen - despite not having a scrap of Shakespeare in the script. Ferociously powerful, hauntingly believable brilliance."
1.0,throne_of_blood,A magnificent adaptation of that Scottish play (Macbeth)! One of Kurosawa's best!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A take on Shakespeare's Macbeth that captures the violent power of the story. It lacks the poetry of Shakespeare's verse, but the surreal imagery is a fine compensation. The scene in the Cobweb forest with the weird ""sister"" is so creepy. lovelovelove"
1.0,throne_of_blood,Japanese samurai version of MacBeth. Somewhat experimental and very classic.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa's best film, and the best Macbeth adaptation ever made."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Älskar samurajaction. Älskar Akira Kurosawa!
1.0,throne_of_blood,and i usually find shakespeare boring
1.0,throne_of_blood,Brilliant. A testament to the truth that Shakespeare's works reach their greatest heights when adapted rather than revered.
1.0,throne_of_blood,All i can say is WOW.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A brilliant adaption of macbeth, probably the best, even though it takes place in a japanese setting. Kurosawa tells the story in a dark and gritty manner, that it's thrilling and scary!"
1.0,throne_of_blood,Too bad it's not in color!!!
1.0,throne_of_blood,An amazing telling of the Macbeth story. I completely recommend this not just for the samurai movie fans but for the Shakespear fans as well.

1.0,throne_of_blood,Competes for top position of a Shakespeare adaptation on film

1.0,throne_of_blood,Lady Macbeth at her most devious
1.0,throne_of_blood,"One of his real classics... the highlight is the way each frame is designed to communicate and awake all your senses... its composition, music and the costumes.."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa brings his unerring eye for indelible images to Shakespeare in this 1957 adaptation of Macbeth. By changing the locale from Birnam Wood to 16th-century Japan, Kurosawa makes an oddball argument for the trans-historicity of Shakespeare's narrative. Amazing acting and soundtrack."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa's best movie IMO
1.0,throne_of_blood,"In my opinion, this film shows mifune at his finest. My favourite ever Shakespeare adaptation, only just beating Ran."

1.0,throne_of_blood,one of the best kurosawa i've seen yet. Brilliantly Created in most every aspect.
1.0,throne_of_blood,I first saw this movie in english class where we were studying Macbeth. I think Shakespeare himself would have been happy with this adaptation.

1.0,throne_of_blood,An amazingly rich adaptation of MacBeth that may be better than the original. The images are haunting and will stay with you for a long time.
1.0,throne_of_blood,The first kurosawa film I saw. Toshiro Mifune's face in the climactic scene will never leave me.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"One of Kurosawa's best. Also, it is one of Toshiro Mifune's best performances. God knows you can't beat the ending."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"The greatest screen version of Shakespeare I've ever seen (and I've seen too many...). Kurosawa's distillation of Macbeth captures the tautness and muscularity of Shakespeare's play brilliantly, and Mifune's performance is quite possibly his best."
1.0,throne_of_blood,The master himself amking one of the best Shakespeare adaptation to screen ever...I mean wow!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was a time of light, it was a time of darkness, Kurosawa exploring the duality of a mind and the versatility of life."

1.0,throne_of_blood,I think this may be Kurosawa's best Shakespeare adaptation.

1.0,throne_of_blood,"Now, that's a Lady M!"
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa retells Macbeth. Mifune brings it to life and risks his life (for real) to tell this tale. One of many movies that I believe everyone should see.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Shakespeare's Macbeth set in fuedal Japan, with suitable twists and cultural modifications to make this a genuine story all its own. The ending is superb. Now if only the real Macbeth were this interesting!"
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Visually its amazing, Mifune's acting is stark and so confident. This movie along with ""I Live in Fear"" just cements Mifune as my favourite actor. Its hard to pick a favourite Kurosawa film but this one keeps coming out on top. Its definitely his creepiest."

1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa must have had a REALLY weird mom/wife/sister every single one of his movies have seriously odd women. Lady macbeth in this adaption wins the prize for ""Goddamn Creepiest Woman In Existence. Ever.""Great movie, beautifully shot."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Samurai's + Macbeth = WICKED
1.0,throne_of_blood,Better than Shakespeare.
1.0,throne_of_blood,I agree with Elliot. This is the best filmed version of macbeth. Orson Welles is not fit to wash Kurisowa's sandals.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Great kurosawa film.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Macbeth by Kurosawa. A superb film with great acting
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A masterpiece of cinema, from the master Kurosawa. One of the greatest endings ever filmed."

1.0,throne_of_blood,amazing adaptation of macbeth in black and white samurai times. spoiler - they shot real arrows at him at the end!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa's take on Macbeth is nothing short of brilliant. Toshiro Mifune's lead performance is gripping and amazing, as always, and the action and cinematography are first-rate."
1.0,throne_of_blood,one of my absolute favorites

1.0,throne_of_blood,The best adaption of Macbeth I've yet seen.

1.0,throne_of_blood,My favourite Macbeth adaptation.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"The best Shakespeare adaptation ever, and soooo much better than The Seven Samurai."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa directs this best Shakespeare adaptation ever.Mifune stars as a man driven mad with power etc.The scene when the Trees come to life is still frighteningly real and effective. I have no idea how they pulled off an effect like that back in '57.
1.0,throne_of_blood,almost as brilliant as Kurosawa's more celebrated 'Rashomon'. it's almost impossible to fault this brilliant adaptation of Shakespeare's 'Macbeth'.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"In my opinion, Kurosawa's best film."

1.0,lavventura,The greatest mystery of all time.
1.0,lavventura,L'Avventura is perhaps the oldest demonstration of how Director Michelangelo Antonioni patiently observes his characters as they try to keep a horrible feeling of isolation and ennui at bay.
1.0,lavventura,My personal all-time favourite!
1.0,lavventura,"Antonioni's film is still highly elusive by today's standards (if only because it presents a mystery that it never intends to solve), and it was arguably the most influential mood piece of the era."
1.0,lavventura,"Antonioni is a master of space in the cinematic image. He envelopes his stories in this authentic, real-but-delicate, honest image that finds our society either deplorable or simply unsatisfying."
1.0,lavventura,Life-is-a-meaningless-bore movie.
1.0,lavventura,One of my favourite of all time! The cinematography of Antonioni's tale of modern solitude is riveting.
1.0,lavventura,No. 1 on my all-time list: The Mona Lisa of film.

1.0,lavventura,"A mysterious story. Beautiful, eerie and melancholy, it's a complex film that truly cannot be summarized. Rather experience."
1.0,lavventura,What begins as a boring game of hide and seek develops into a magnificent piece of Italian film making. Absolutely stunning cinematography and a well written script make this film one of my personal favorites. It helps to have some smokin hot actresses as well.
1.0,lavventura,"So many things left unsaid. Or better not said at all. Nah, this is a film that I don't even want to dwell deep into because it's too disturbing."
1.0,lavventura,What a sumptuous production. I felt so drawn into this story with wonderfully rich characters and a riveting ending which contemporary filmmakers wish to strive for.

1.0,lavventura,The greatest movie ever made.
1.0,lavventura,"I never know what to say about Antonioni's films, I just know that this is my favourite."

1.0,lavventura,One of Antonioni's Finest. Masterpiece.

1.0,lavventura,"What more can be said about this? Not my favorite Antonioni but this is still maddeningly slow, totally groundbreaking, and completely depressing."

1.0,lavventura,Michelangelo Antonioni great Italian director...
1.0,lavventura,Put short and sweet: visual poetry.

1.0,lavventura,"obra cumbre del cineasta italiano antonioni,llena de crudeza sentimental,imposible narrar mas,obligatoria para la cinefilia."

Tercera vez que me lanzo a la aventura de ver esta película y tercera vez que quedó impresionado"
1.0,lavventura,"There are good films and bad films and some in between. The I see The Adventure, and I had to make a new catagorey. Watching it was similar, to have you best friend beside you eating quality choclates and speaking from the soul. One of the mosent enjoyable few hours I can ever remember."
1.0,lavventura,you just know it has genius written all over it but you just can't pin-point it!! Now I begin to realize why monica vitti fell in love with her director!!!

1.0,lavventura,"Breathtaking, devastating. One of the greatest films ever made. (Note: many find this film unbearably boring)."

1.0,lavventura,"a brilliant meditation on relationships, and the sensual self. the film's visual framing and pacing is amazing."
0.0,lavventura,Terribly boring and boringly terrible! It doesn't matter if Antonioni is considered a master!
0.0,lavventura,"Antonioni subverted current film trends with L'Avventura, but he removed joy and interest as well. This is the slowest, most boring film I have ever seen; Russian films seem like Hollywood action flicks by comparison. One star for the beautiful scene compositions."
1.0,lavventura,Letargica (en el mejor sentido de la palabra) cinta acerca del aburrimiento y la desesperacion de ser uno mas en la vida. Relevante. Fotografia excepcional.
1.0,lavventura,"One of Antonioni's early gems. Kids, please tune in, and be enriched for life."

1.0,lavventura,The birth of modern filmmaking.
1.0,lavventura,"The title of this film is a LIE! A big fat stinking LIE! There's no ""adventure"" in this movie, it's just a bunch of stuck-ups lost on an island and looking bored in bed. Not cool, not exciting.  L'Avvoid, at all costs."
1.0,lavventura,Don't stand so close to me
1.0,lavventura,So well conceived I can't possibly describe it.

1.0,lavventura,one of the most important film in my life
1.0,lavventura,amazing. 'nuff said.
1.0,lavventura,Simply the most important film to come out of the neorealism movement. One of the most powerful renderings of the human condition and the struggle between man's social constructs against natural law.
1.0,lavventura,"oh wow its gorgeous and so is monica vitti. i dont know what i loved more, the film or her."
1.0,lavventura,Uno dei grandi film sul tema dell'alienazione nei rapporti interpersonali. Qualucuno lo accusa di essere semplicemente un freddo esercizio di stile; ovviamente non e' cosi'.

1.0,lavventura,"I prefer L'Eclisse, but this is still a five-starrer."
1.0,lavventura,One of the most gorgeously photographed films ever.
1.0,lavventura,"The crowning achievement of Antonionis career and seen by many as the birth of modern cinema language, this spell-binding film also features two strong performances by Monica Vitti and Lea Massari, two of the most intriguing actresses in the history of italian cinema."

1.0,lavventura,"Loneliness, weariness, exhaustion... A true cult classic."
1.0,lavventura,I believe this film is truly a masterwork and among the greatest films ever made. Antonioni's masterful use of cinematography; the amazing script; the fascinating turn of events; the skilled acting all contribute to make this a movie of incredible beauty and intelligence.
1.0,lavventura,A master's work. In the end everything is a pretext to be together and the characters even make you forget what are they searching for. Not an easy movie. I had to watch it a LOT of times until I became satisfied with my understanding of it... but worth it... such a delight in every respect!
1.0,lavventura,Bella fotografia. Deve vedere.Elevate prestazioni e la direzione.
1.0,lavventura,Antonioni at his best ...with the stunning Lea Massari .... wow!
1.0,lavventura,"With Godard, Antonioni paved the way for modern cinema (way more than Bergman or Felini) and, like Godard, his films are still way ahead of the game. A narrative film that is as purely cinematic as it gets. This, for once, is actually CINEMA."
1.0,lavventura,The love triangle... Classic. Could watch it 3 times in a row.Monica Vitti is the women I'm still looking for...
1.0,lavventura,everything in love matters so much that it really doesn't. this is the breakthrough movie that allowed it all to happen and be set free. i melt for monica vitti at times.
1.0,lavventura,"This movie is one that is tough for me to sit through. It's not always pleasant, but the acting is superb. I found that I enjoyed it even more the second time I watched."
1.0,lavventura,"Haunting and isolating. A film that sucks you into a place you really don't want to be at, but is so engrossing that you can't help it."
1.0,lavventura,"this is where it all began for me- my love for Antonioni, Vitti, south-Italian landscapes and the 'romance' with existantialism...what if people built houses like that lonely one embracing the rocks of the deserted island?"
1.0,lavventura,"Monica Vitti goes up with Camus's Meursault and Max von Sydow's character, Antonious Block (the Seventh Seal) as one of the great existentialist protagonists."
1.0,lavventura,"Well, it's about nothing. And nothing happens. But it's absolutely beautiful - good enough for me."
1.0,lavventura,Monica Vitti is hot.
1.0,lavventura,This film marks the beginning of a certain visual paradigm that has influenced most films that I love that have been made since then.
1.0,lavventura,The first of three movies about womens transformation in the post war Europe. The scene of the girl who scandalize the litle town is a must. Terriffic images frames the angst and impatient of women searching for freedom
1.0,lavventura,"This is a very strange movie. Black and white, most beautiful images of the mediterranean island, a feast for the senses."
1.0,lavventura,Mmmm Monica Vitti. Antonioni at his best.
1.0,lavventura,Haunting and beautiful.
1.0,lavventura,"i just watched it twice. each time i see it i understand the nuances of gesture, expression, and place to tell the story better. ""knife in the water"" by roman polanski must have been influenced by this movie. i love that one too."
1.0,lavventura,Monica Vitti is stunning. Incredibly seductive and vulnerable at the same time. Antonioni's best.
1.0,lavventura,A film haunted by Monica Vitti's absense-as-presence. Into the void. Amazing.
1.0,lavventura,Phenomenal Monica Vitti!
1.0,lavventura,Monica Vitti pouts and acts as Antonioni's muse in this fascinating study into the emptiness of the male-female dynamic.
1.0,lavventura,"Serge Belongie recommended it, I loved it. An essay on the desperate emptiness of the life of people who lost the ability to communicate."
1.0,lavventura,holy shit a really good movie
1.0,lavventura,I simply love this film... every single shot of it
1.0,lavventura,if you think that people are losing their consciences in the modern world and if you don't have power and clear reason to judge this situation. watch this film. This film is one of the strongest cricisim to the hegemony of the language constructed by the modern world.
1.0,lavventura,"The first of Antonioni's alienation trilogy (L'Avventura, La Notte, L'Eclisse). The film in which he discovered a new cinematic langauge. A revolutionary filmmaking!"
1.0,lavventura,so lonely...so touching...

1.0,lavventura,Great film. looking forward to seeing some more of Anonioni's films
1.0,lavventura,"Simply stunning. Monica Vitti never looked so good or performed so well in her career. Antonioni's film is more about cinematic imagery and masterfully, yet sparsely, placed context. The subtext is where one needs to dig in this film. Absolutely stark, yet romantic."
1.0,lavventura,"the cinematic equivalent of a novel, and all its complexities and nuances. A turning point in the history of film."
1.0,lavventura,"wow! The cinematography, the story, Italy! I love it!"
1.0,lavventura,Masterful filmaking! Antonioni requires switching on your brain.
1.0,lavventura,"Phenomenal!A very strange, meandering film, which is a milestone and a masterpiece of cinema.Antonioni is the master of mise en scene.The actors do great jobs playing the shallows characeters of a very deep film.Uncomfortably honest and suspensefully slow."
0.0,lavventura,one of the worst movies i have ever seen. it is utterly pointless.
1.0,lavventura,"A very complicated film in terms of plot, but in 1959 it revolutionized cinema."
1.0,lavventura,"Beautiful, heart-wrenching, profound. It is captivating from the beginning. I loved it."

1.0,lavventura,"i think that's Michelangelo Antonioni's best film. more delicat and emotional than his later work, and still, has all the elements that made him such a great director"
1.0,lavventura,"I was introduced to the films of Antonioni at a retrospective at the Walter Reade theater probably fifteen years ago. This is not my favorite of his, but I think it is his best. Monica Vitti is stunning, the landscape is hauntingly stark, and the anxiety is palpable."

1.0,lavventura,"Cold and distant or poetic and profound? A sublime work of art, nevertheless."
1.0,lavventura,"This film is a beautiful mystery. It remains a beautiful mystery. Do not expect anything more than amazing images and a feeling of loss at the end. I think I have watched this film a dozen times, just to get lost in it. Monica Vitti is iconic."
1.0,lavventura,"The great Antonioni's most well-known work. A striking, hallucinatory opus."
1.0,lavventura,I can't begin to express how stylish and amazing Antonioni is.
1.0,lavventura,"this movie hypnotized me from beginning to end. so organic, so earthy, so sensual, so void. the final frame is my favourite ever."
1.0,lavventura,i love anything by Antonioni
1.0,lavventura,"Incredible. As an added bonus, Monica Vitti is so beautiful in this movie that I would kill my own mother just to kiss her existentially disengaged hand."
1.0,lavventura,"A truly remarkable film, utterly compelling throughout. Monica Vitti is wonderful. Antonioni proving once again that he isn't just a film-maker but a true artist."
1.0,lavventura,"I still, two years after first seeing it, can't get the visuals out of my mind. Antonioni is an artistic genius in every respect."
1.0,lavventura,"The movie is ahead of it's time. The dual plotline, the mezmorizing imagery, the metaphor, the irony, themes, performances. This is Antonionni's best work."
1.0,lavventura,Ennui. Man as an island.
1.0,lavventura,"Every shot is breathtaking. Antonioni is a master of letting silence carry across a landscape--the sea, jagged islands,small towns,a church--and letting silence carry such emotional weight. Vitti is divine in this film. Just divine."
1.0,lavventura,"Stark portrait of isolation and loneliness. Remarkable film, but not for everyone."
1.0,lavventura,"Ambiguous. The way she touches his shoulders as he weeps. Virtuosic. Patient cinema. Horizons. Architectural. Cool, set mostly in summer."
1.0,lavventura,Antonioni's trade mark style of blowing anything up that no longer serves the plot is brought to new levels in this; the first film to feature a live person's head exploding...
1.0,lavventura,This is one of the movies for which images stayed imprinted in my head for days and weeks after watching it. Simply astounding cinematography.
1.0,lavventura,"Antonioni has no equal in cinema, and is decades ahead of his time. This film along with the others of his trilogy are the grammar of European cinema."
1.0,lavventura,"Again, with the fucking Italians and their pitch perfect cinematography. Also, Monica Vitti...nails."
1.0,lavventura,I can't wait for the remake with Halle Barry!
1.0,lavventura,Influenced film making forever....
1.0,lavventura,another one of the movies that moved me early on. never had I seen something so thick and intellectually vital.
1.0,lavventura,"A Flawless film exploring not only complacency, but the very concept of temporary. The visuals dazzle, the structure defies tradition, and the film's emotion pierces with cold accuracy. Antonioni was never better and Monica Vitti was never more gorgeous."
1.0,lavventura,"so true, so real, one word to describe it: masterpiece."
1.0,lavventura,Antonioni ha fatto un film molto bello ed un'opera d'arte...
1.0,lavventura,"A masterpiece of mood and reserve. There is so much left unsaid, and yet one does not desire for Antonioni to reveal more than he has."
1.0,lavventura,A great film that messes with your mind; a powerful tribute to symbolism.
1.0,lavventura,aesthetic itself can blow you away...
1.0,lavventura,"Antonioni is one of the few true masters of cinema. Like an Iron Chef, his work is delicious, but might sometimes look impenetrable. So many films shoot for what he achieves brilliantly and just fall short. There is something very beautiful and important happening here."
1.0,lavventura,Electrifying ghost story!
1.0,lavventura,"Flawless, Antonioni has created a piece of art that is pure film aesthetic. His characters are vessels by which Antonioni is able to explore some of the most deep themes in life that I have seen in a film."
1.0,lavventura,Slow as hell but worth watching
1.0,lavventura,"Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Avventura (""The Adventure""), arguably the most startling of modern films, has had so much written about it that it seems kind of pointless to throw out more superlatives."
1.0,lavventura,My #50 film of all time. This will haunt your thoughts for a long time. The final scene will forever give you chills.
1.0,lavventura,Another Antonioni Classic! A love story in the midst of a mysterious dissapearance. We only know what we need to know.
1.0,lavventura,"Antonioni perfects his art of ""unresolution"" with this masterpiece. Beautifully shot, with amazing acting from Monica Vitti."
1.0,gojira,"It never falters, delivers on all of it's promises, and has an entertaining and very mind-absorbing plot, which bears more meaning than most of us can possibly even imagine. But in the end, one thing's for sure, and that is that this is Godzilla, and he has never. . . ever. . . been better."
1.0,gojira,"holds up very well. top 10 movie. analogy of nuclear war. haunting with a guy in a rubber suit, how do you pull that off with such a great visual ad aural movie?!"
0.0,gojira,I thought this movie was boring. I dont get how Godzilla became such a huge thing if this was the original.
1.0,gojira,My favorite movie ever
1.0,gojira,"A timeless classic that dealt with nuclear issues, still relevant today."
1.0,gojira,A good deal of time in my childhood was spent watching Godzilla movies. I loved the campy ones back then but have developed an appreciation for the original as I have aged.
1.0,gojira,"Good film, great story, great lesson and is full of action"
1.0,gojira,I LOVE GOJIRA!!!!!!!
1.0,gojira,"This is my favorite movie of all time. Gojiras suit is really menacing and he just looks real Ishiro Honda can make movies, sadly people think the new Godzilla movies are better but in my opinion this is the best."
1.0,gojira,"A cinematic masterpiece, historical movie treasure. This film is awesome. Special effects are tremendous. The use of miniature models is superb. Night scenes with Godzilla photographed flawlessly. Social message is strong and clear given the dark times of the postwar world and a fear of nuclear war."
1.0,gojira,I was delightfully surprised by the human elements in this movie. It's one of the rarest horror movies to make me sympathize sincerely for humanity.
1.0,gojira,100/A+. One of the best postwar commentary and anti nuclear films. Yes it's the same movie with a guy in a giant lizard costume destroy miniature sections of Tokyo and toy military vehicles.
1.0,gojira,The original Godzilla film is a masterpiece of Japanese cinema!
1.0,gojira,"The most iconic movie from Japan, Godzilla or Gojira is a impact of cinema with it's classic technology of a man in a rubber suit. So satisfying to see destruction at it's best!"
1.0,gojira,"Spectacular, deeply political, and emotionally moving artwork!!"
1.0,gojira,Great Movie with a great message about the atomic weapons
1.0,gojira,Best monster from Japon and one of my favorites.
1.0,gojira,A masterpiece. Both very dark and very haunting.
1.0,gojira,"One of my all-time favourite movies and in no way a B-movie, but a grim, heart-felt disaster movie which metaphors Godzilla in a perfect way."
1.0,gojira,One of the best monster movies.
1.0,gojira,"One of, if not the best monster film ever made, great film, second, in my mind only to Jaws"
1.0,gojira,You Rottentomatoes people need to give this movie a 100% postive.
1.0,gojira,Great with the actors treating this as a natural disaster
1.0,gojira,A timeless classic! Nothing else to say but you need to watch this!
1.0,gojira,The roaring granddaddy of kaiju films.
1.0,gojira,A truly epic and dramatic piece of Japanese cinema.
1.0,gojira,"If you're uninitiated, I can almost guarantee that the tone of the third act will surprise you, even if you aren't impressed by Tsuburaya's now archaic, but nevertheless ingenious effects"
1.0,gojira,My absolute favorite film ever made
1.0,gojira,Probably the best monster movie ever made.
1.0,gojira,The very first and best godzilla movie ever made and it came 60 years ago
1.0,gojira,Amazing! Best Monster Film Alltime
1.0,gojira,"Not a classic monster movie. The classic monster movie. It may not be my exact number one favorite Godzilla, but its close. This is an amazing and intriguing movie. It's dark and somber and its not to be missed."
1.0,gojira,One of the greatest monster movies of all timeGreat acting that makes feel for the character Great effects (for its time)Great cinematography And great soundtrack that will last forever
1.0,gojira,The original masterpiece Gojira. It's potent and has impact and is a classic for a reason.
1.0,gojira,"Devastating, enthralling, and actually quite frightening; Gojira is a biting piece of post-war commentary and as timeless as it is politically astute."
1.0,gojira,Man in rubber suit tramples on matchstick models of Tokyo as denizens look up in terror. The original Godzilla is all that and more. The original Godzilla is far different from the tag team slogfests that followed. Much imitated (I'm talking about you Jurassic Park) but rarely bettered.
1.0,gojira,"Even after all these years, it's still a great movie."
1.0,gojira,"Gojira(Godzilla) is a film of great suspense, brilliant storytelling, amazing effects(for time) and spectacular characters. These factors and more make this my personal pick for the greatest movie of all time."
1.0,gojira,"While the special effects are dated, it still holds up to this day as the best monster movie of all time, offering emotionally gripping human drama that provides a chilling realistic atmosphere. It all builds up to an epic third act that will forever leave us questioning our ethics and morals."
1.0,gojira,original definitely a classic monster movie
1.0,gojira,A chilling masterpiece deserving of a 60 year (and counting!) franchise
1.0,gojira,ohhhh the original was so corny but awesome
1.0,gojira,One of the greatest films I have ever seen
1.0,gojira,The introduction to the king
1.0,gojira,The amazing birth of the most iconic monster in film history
1.0,gojira,"A Product of the Times, Yet Also Far Ahead of it's Time, Godzilla (or Gojira) remains as a staple of the monster movie, and one of the few to truly take advantage of it, dated, yet timeless, it's a movie that stands as tall as it's title monster"
1.0,gojira,One of the greatest monster movies ever. Genuinely scary too.
1.0,gojira,Godjira is one of the few 1950s monster films that has managed to stand the test of time. It is fantastic!

1.0,gojira,Perfection! Awesome atomic warfare allegory!!! Brilliant!!! So thought-provoking!!!
1.0,gojira,A master peice by every definition of the word. It truly brings to life the horrors of nuclear war and is much more serious and gritty in tone than the more campy sequels of the 60's and 70's. Looking forward to the new one coming may 2014!
1.0,gojira,This movie is Beautiful. A masterpiece. More than a monster movie
1.0,gojira,Gojira is more than your average monster flick; it shows the suffering and pain of a nation that experienced first hand the horrors of the atomic age.

1.0,gojira,Incredible and great. Gojira has a great story and its monster was ficious.
1.0,gojira,"Possibly my favorite monster movie of all time. Godzilla looks menacing and the gritty, black-and-white cinematography and the dark tone makes the destruction of Tokyo look that much more catastrophic."
1.0,gojira,"Every manga, every anime, every cartoon, every movie that deals with monsters has its foundation and influences based around this one iconic monster."
1.0,gojira,"Everyone knows Godzilla, it's a fact. This is the film that started it all, with a strong Anti - Nuke message and a hell of a lot of destruction. It is easy to see why this movie is a cultural icon!"
1.0,gojira,Manages to be a bleak and effective allegory while at the same time being a fun monster movie.
1.0,gojira,"DVD Original, Theatrical"
1.0,gojira,"A great entry in science fiction cinema worldwide. From beggining to end, it is amazing to watch. It takes itself much more serious than what the average person might suppose, and it's a definite ""must-see"" for any sci-fi fan."
0.0,gojira,"It has became a classic, but, I've never liked Gojira at all. It looks really fake."
1.0,gojira,A sad depressing movie. That shows the horror of nuclear weapons.

1.0,gojira,This movie is a masterpiece.
1.0,gojira,The criterion edition makes the picture quality look better than ever. And i actually like the 1956 American version as well.

1.0,gojira,Beautiful! Rich! Moving! Gojira!
1.0,gojira,"More than just a monster movie, a great social commentary. For those who think the idea of a man in a rubber suit is stupid, it looks far more realistic than CGI! What a classic movie, I enjoy it more every time I watch it."
1.0,gojira,"One of the most incredible movies of all time. No, really. It's far beyond the cheesy 60's Godzilla and totally takes it seriously. As well, its far better than even the U.S. Raymond Burr version. As good, if not better, than the classic King Kong, and deserving of much more appreciation."
1.0,gojira,"Groundbreaking monster film, that tells of the dangers of nuclear bombs. Deals with serious issues via a form of entertainment. Great classic film."
1.0,gojira,Unexpectedly depressing and emotionally resonant. A franchise that turned into silly fun started out as a fascinating anti-war masterpiece.
1.0,gojira,The Classics can never go out of hand. 4 Stars! check it out if you are a godzilla fan!
1.0,gojira,"Truly one of the greatest foreign films ever. It breaks the mold of what a monster movie can be, and started a whole legacy of its own. One of my all time favorites."
1.0,gojira,"On the surface 50's monster B-movie, underneath allegory for war and nuclear weapons. Corny and cheesy at times, it is also haunting and terrifying when it needs to be. This movie pretty much launched the kaiju and tokusatsu film industries in Japan."
1.0,gojira,Stunning japanese masterpeice.
1.0,gojira,Easily one of the best monster movies ever made. The movie looks great in black and white and has nice charm to it. This movie had good special effects for the time and is very enjoyable.

1.0,gojira,The origianl that shows the beautiful classic affects of Eiji Tsubaraya. And doens't feature perry mason to ruin it.
1.0,gojira,This is a great monster movie that goes beyond the typical campy stuff and actually tells very dark tale with a powerful message about war and its affect on humanity.
1.0,gojira,men in rubber monster suits... this is what classic movie making is ALL about
1.0,gojira,This film got me into Godzilla. Plain and Simple.
1.0,gojira,Classic monster movie. It has never grown old for me.
1.0,gojira,"This is my FAVORITE Godzilla movie, I like it more than final wars. Why? Because it starts the legend of Gojira (Godzilla)"
1.0,gojira,"Absolutely astounding. No other film in the series (with the exception of Return of Godzilla) captures the power and horror of the beast. He is the bomb, and while watching his destruction of Japan, you start to believe it"
1.0,gojira,"If you've only seen the American re-edit, then you haven't seen Godzilla. This one packs an emotional whallop!"
1.0,gojira,As much as I love the Burr version (and I do) the original Japanese version of Gojira (Godzilla) is an absolute masterpiece. It truly captures the horrors that Japan suffered in the aftermath of the atomic bomb.
1.0,gojira,"Godzilla is the man, The beginning of a 50 year monster icon."
1.0,gojira,This is a MASTERPIECE
1.0,gojira,"The original Japanese masterpiece, as it was meant to be seen. Yeah, the American version is a nice 50's monster movie, but this version transcends beyond that, and it's message can be heard for modern audiences at last."
1.0,gojira,"Gojira aka Godzilla (1954) is THE greatest monster movie ever made, and if you can get passed the 50 year old low budget effects you'll see the way Godzilla was meant to be seen"
1.0,gojira,The Japanese version is better than the American (Raymond Burr) version.
1.0,gojira,"A Frankenstein fable for the atomic age, supported by brilliant acting (yes! in a Godzilla movie) and ingenious lighting make this Kaiju classic no laughing matter."
1.0,gojira,"Very dark, and sometimes scary, especially layered shots of Godzilla and the people running at his feet. Very moving, and heavy. Akira Ifikube's score is incredible, and makes the film work. An excellent cast, and compelling story make this a deep impact in cinematic history."
1.0,gojira,"After so many years and so many viewings this film hasn't lost a bit of power or effect. It stands above the rest not because it was the first in the Godzilla series, but because it experiments heavily with a narrative style that resembles what we call cutting edge today."
1.0,gojira,"I'm serious, Godzilla has balls. Other movies go great with Megadeth!"
1.0,gojira,Easily the best monster film ever.
1.0,gojira,The most powerful most moving most purposeful Godzilla movie and the first of them all

1.0,gojira,The original! Watch the Japanese version to understand the movie better.
1.0,gojira,"THE monster movie of the 20th Century - though also much more. As dark and disturbing a nuclear allegory today as it was in 1954, GOJIRA is, quite simply, a masterpiece."
1.0,gojira,"This movie is a masterpiece. It is more than just a monster running loose film, it is a terrifing reminder of the horrors of nuclear weapons and testing. Seeing a mother huddled in rumble with her two children, telling them they will all be with daddy soon, is heart wrenching in a horrifing manner."
1.0,gojira,Fantastic. Puts a smile on my face every time.
1.0,gojira,"The original Godzilla was a horror movie with no pretense of good and evil, simply the mind-numbing destruction of a man-made force."
1.0,gojira,The one that started it all - deep amazing and moving - this is not just a guy in suit this is a real film a cry against the arms race and the maddness of war. (not that guy in the suit films are bad).
1.0,gojira,The Classic! You Must See!!!
1.0,gojira,One of the best monster movies ever - especially the uncut Japanese original.
1.0,gojira,Nuclear weapons are bad. Movies with big giant fire breathing monsters on a rampage are awesome.  I really want to watch the rest of the Godzilla movies now.
1.0,gojira,This is the original Japanese edit without all the American crap with Raymond Burr sliced in. It's so much better!!
1.0,gojira,This is the best monster movie ever made. It is simply amazing.
1.0,gojira,"The absolute pinnacle of monster movies. This is the measure by which all others are weighed, measured, and found wanting."
1.0,gojira,I love all the TOYO Godzilla films ... but here it started. Even better is the real original version sans Raymond Burr
1.0,gojira,"The first one, and definitely one of the greatest. The original Japanese version, this one, is FAR superior to the Americanization with Raymond Burr. Scarier, too."
1.0,gojira,"Just... too... awesome. This is the kind of monster movie I grew up with, in fact it's the king of them all. It also has a great meaning behind it."
1.0,gojira,This is the one that started it all. The original Japanese cut that is more powerful than the American cut. A classic to change people's view on giant monster movies.
1.0,gojira,"This movie is the original Godzilla, and it's bad ass for being from the 50's. FUCK CLOVERFIELD!"
1.0,gojira,best science fiction film made in japan and the best of the series of godzilla
1.0,gojira,Just terrifying. Still the best monster on film.
1.0,gojira,Top notch sound effects and costumes! A++
1.0,gojira,The Japanese version is better than the American if you don't mind subtitle.
1.0,gojira,"After growing up with the silly American re-working of this film and eventually discovering the original on a low-quality bootleg copy of a copy, it's wonderful to finally have a proper version of this film in my collection."
1.0,gojira,"Sad, unflinching and potent."
1.0,gojira,The first and Still the best.
1.0,gojira,"the ultimate classic that spawned more than 20 sequels and made monster movies what they are today. every monster after this was modeled after godzilla, but you gotta love the big ol lizard. if your a fan of him, you have to have seen this movie. its where it all started."
1.0,gojira,One of my favorite films of all time
1.0,gojira,This is the original un-cut Japanese version which is much longer and more in-depth than the heavily cut American Version.
1.0,gojira,"One of the greatest movies ever made, finally released in America in it's unsanitized version. Even my father, who self identifies as a right wing Republican, loved it when we sat down and watched it together. Watch it with a friend, you'll have something to talk about at the end."
1.0,gojira,The greatest move ever filmed. The true king of all movies.
1.0,gojira,"It's a masterpiece, I am proud of tha t this film affected famous directors after all. It's classic but still better than the remake in Hollywood"
1.0,gojira,Definitely a masterpiece. Groundbreaking filming techniques make this movie a must see for any science fiction fan.
1.0,gojira,great. i didn't think the first godzilla movie would be smart
1.0,gojira,Much more grittier and gripping than the dubbed American version with Raymond Burr. Japanese movies also sound more serious in the original Japanese.
1.0,gojira,"Back when Godzilla movies were serious. Basically, an allegory for the A-Bomb. Also, the greatest giant monster movie of all time."
1.0,gojira,"The original Godzilla, and the only good one. More a social commentary then a monster flick, this movie is compelling and beautifully filmed. One of my favorited movies since I was about 3."
1.0,gojira,"Way betterthan the Americanized bastardization of it. The metaphor was straightforward, yet moving nonetheless."
1.0,gojira,It is an all time classic plus the start really of all the big monster movies. Plus it is one of the better Godzilla films too.
1.0,gojira,A seriously great monster movie.
1.0,gojira,Accept no substitutes.
1.0,gojira,Accept no substitutes.
1.0,gojira,"Do not watch the American cut, accept only the original source of all our terrors, the one and the original. Everyone who made this movie would have PERSONAL connections to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and THIS is their story, a film which has no peers."
1.0,gojira,Haunting and Original! This flick is more than just a monster movie. It packs a real message about the dangers of nuclear weaponry and will no doubt leave you in tears.
1.0,gojira,A short review..if you have never seen a Godzilla movie.THis is the one you should see
1.0,gojira,"Say what you want about the sequels, but don't make fun of this one. It actually succeeds at being serious and bleak."
1.0,gojira,THE greatest monster movie ever made. And that is not an opinion.
1.0,gojira,Pure classic. If only there were more movies like this.
1.0,gojira,Total Classic...I tend to not like monster movies but this is like few others. A lot of politcal comentary in this one.
1.0,gojira,"The classic, the one that started it all and really deserving of classic status, but only the Japanese version not the inferior American version."
1.0,gojira,"For being 1954, spectacular effects, also makes you think about the effect of nuclear weapons. The line from the song godzilla comes to mind. ""History shows again and again how nature points to the falling of man."""
1.0,gojira,"screw Jaws and The Host, this is the best monster-on-the-loose flick ever made, AND a poignant statement about the horrors of war. if you can see the original Japanese version you'll never look at men in suits the same way again."
1.0,gojira,"The Rolls Royce of monster movies, ""Gojira"" is simply a legendary classic."
1.0,gojira,"Possibly the most brilliant and deep monster movie ever, ever. If you've only seen the american version, this is a totally different film."
1.0,gojira,"The original 1954 version is much more in depth than many would be lead to believe, and Akira Ifukube's score is stellar. The American version while butchered is still pretty good."
1.0,gojira,see the original version from japan. It is awesome.
1.0,gojira,"Both versions are great. I think comparison between the two is unnecessary, now that they are sold together. The original is great, Burr is great too. He really knew how to ""serious"" it up! Godzilla used to be scary; but was always fun!!"
1.0,gojira,a landmark in cinema history. incredible movie. one of the best movies ever made.
1.0,gojira,the original is always the best
1.0,gojira,"The 1954 Japanese version is a masterpiece with an obvious allegory and symbolism to WWII and the atomic bombings in Japan. Oh, and the U.S. version is still pretty fun."
1.0,gojira,"The original 1954 masterpiece, and it's FAR different from it's many sequels and imitators. Brilliantly done, and the symbolism is powerful."
1.0,gojira,"""Just go and watch it dammit!!!"""
1.0,gojira,More than a mere monster movie with a guy in a rubber suit smashing cardboard buildings and model tanks and planes. An artful and somber allegory to WWII and the atomic bomb. See this before the American version. It's better.
1.0,gojira,If you don't like this...you aren't a real person. Gojira forever.
1.0,gojira,The Original -and The Best.
1.0,gojira,"Although the effects are dated, the movie remains a compelling allegory for nuclear warfare. While it's not the goofiest, it's the best ""Godzilla"" film. Akira Ifukube supplies a pulse-pounding score."
1.0,gojira,"The one that started it all. If you are a serious Big G fan, you'll watch both. If not, avoid the campiness and watch the original Japanese version. It's more enjoyable."
1.0,gojira,The one that started it all. Japan's allegorical piece about nuclear weapons which would be the foundation of an unlikely long lived franchise.
1.0,gojira,Very underrated. Actually has some very moving scenes and a real message and point. Essential to see the original Japanese version.
1.0,gojira,"A man in a rubber-suit, do I need to say more?"
1.0,gojira,"The beginning of the greatest series of films, ever."
1.0,gojira,Best monster movie. Ever.
1.0,gojira,most people see a giant rubber suit . . . those people are fucking retarded
1.0,gojira,basically the best giant monster film on earth
1.0,gojira,The ultimate giant monster movie. The American version (Godzilla: King of the Monsters) is passable but misses the point.
1.0,gojira,Japanese version all the way! How it was meant to be seen.
1.0,gojira,Godzilla rocks!!!!!!!!! I have loved this movie since I was a little kid!
1.0,gojira,One of the best Japanese films ever made. This is the one that started it all.
1.0,gojira,"The greatest movie ever made. I've seen it over 3,000 times!!!!"
1.0,gojira,Hauntingly beautiful anti-nuclear movie.
1.0,gojira,"Not only a great monster movie, Gojira is a powerful allegory for the atomic age from the one nation that knows the true horror of atomic power."
1.0,gojira,Its Godzilla whats not to like
1.0,gojira,"Godzilla's darkest and perhaps crowning hour, one that represents the monster as not only a city destroying fiend but a threat to man's very extistence. As many other reviews have said the undercurrents of this movie are very deep and potentially very disturbing as well."
1.0,gojira,"Even better in the original Japanese version- Find out how they REALLY feel about us and our ""devices"""
1.0,gojira,"The ORIGINAL!!! No Raymond Burr, etc.."
1.0,gojira,"I was a fan when I was a kid, but I am sticking with this film especially because it is incredible, given that it is from 1954. With the effects they had at the time, this is by far one of the best movies ever made."
1.0,gojira,"very good, very sad, anti war and nuclear weapons movie"
1.0,gojira,This is the very first Godzilla movie for the period it was one of the best post war (WW2) films ever done. The original is a must see. Hands down.
1.0,gojira,"The best G-film period and also a landmark for Horror and Sci-Fi. This film paved the way for other Japanese films, shows, and games to become popular. A film that will go down in history."
1.0,gojira,"The best Godzilla film is the original. unlike every movie after this one, this is genuinly a good movie. (I do like all the other movies, but lets be real, their cheesy as hell.) This movie is full of symbolism about nuclear weapons. I urge everyone to see this movie."
1.0,gojira,"Not what you would expect from the King of the Monsters. This is him before the fame and foes acting as an analogy. a statement in post war Japanese fear and anxiety, a horror of it's time and classic of ours"
1.0,gojira,"Best monster movie, ever. Some of the camerawork is truly brilliant, and Godzilla is a great commentary on post-Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan."
1.0,gojira,"The best Godzilla by far. Its raw film making doesnt patronise the viewer like most modern movies, allowing the simple effects, storyline and atmosphere work its magic."
1.0,gojira,The quintessential Japanese monster movie.
1.0,gojira,The movie that started it all. This movie i saw when i was a little kid and got me into the whole moster movie thing. I have been a fan every since and this movie captivates everything that is amazing about the original movie monster.
1.0,gojira,Do yourself a favour and look past the fact that there's a man in a lizard suit and don't let yourself miss this timeless sci-fi classic! It's was the catalyst for the giant monster movie and also drives home a deeper message about the horrors of nuclear weapons.
1.0,gojira,"The original, the classic. The one that started it all."
1.0,gojira,Great Nuclear Message without all the American Bastardizations.
1.0,gojira,One of the greatest films of all time
1.0,gojira,I've never quite gotten over this movie.
1.0,gojira,"The quintessential giant monster film. Arguably the only one in the genre that can be considered a masterpiece of cinema. Dark and somber in tone, with tons of subtleties. Easily on par with the best the movie world has to offer. Also, giant monster smashing shit."
1.0,gojira,The lack of respect given to this movie and Ishiro Honda sickens me.
1.0,gojira,EXCELLENT. I finally have seen the REAL version. And I loved it.
1.0,gojira,The original. Nothing more to say.
1.0,gojira,Best monster movie of all time.
1.0,gojira,"Finally, America gets to see the origonal film that made Godzilla a ledgend"
1.0,gojira,"It is the undisputed king of all monster movies, a dark and deeply disturbing metaphor for the monster that is American hubris."
1.0,gojira,"They should do a remake, but not like the one they already made. A japanese remake. 'Twould be sweet."
1.0,gojira,"Not just a fantastic monster movie, that's just the selling feature. It's a fantastic anti-war/anti-nuclear movie depicting scenes of struggle and hardship much like the aftermath of Hiroshima."
1.0,gojira,Legendary! That's all you need to know!
1.0,gojira,"Possibly the best monster movie made. Must have been chilling to see only 10 years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the anti-nuclear arms race message is much clearer in the original version."
1.0,gojira,"This is one of my favorite movies. A terrific anti-war film, one that could only have been made in postwar Japan. And, of course, it brought us the immortal character of Godzilla."
1.0,gojira,"A tense and terrifying monster movie, yes, but also a touching requiem for the horrors visited by World War II, and a call for nobility and self-sacrifice to return in the post-war age."
1.0,gojira,"The original, and best Godzilla is the most serious, dark and depressing of the series with an anti-war message that is as clear today as ever. Very strong characters and thought provoking writing lead this monster masterpiece."
1.0,gojira,My most favorite movie of all time. Not only is it about a giant monster destroying everything it also has a deep and inspiring message. To top it all off there's no Steve Martin. This started a life long obsession for these films.
1.0,gojira,Classic Japanese horror/sci-fi movie. I could sit through a 1000 of these things. I Love this stuff!
1.0,gojira,"Don't see Godzilla, see Gojira."
1.0,gojira,Perhaps the most misunderstood movie of all time. The Japanese version is without question a cinematic milestone.
1.0,gojira,"By far the best godzilla movie, especially the original japanese version without the american scenes in.Definately a defining moment in cinema history."
1.0,gojira,The original and best monster movie ever made.
1.0,gojira,Classics are the best not some movie remade over and over to make money...whom ever made this had something to get across to other people. obviously the attact on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But even in it seriousness still a great movie.
1.0,gojira,This movie pretty much changed my life. I like the original Japanese and Raymond Burr versions for different reasons.
1.0,gojira,"It's a classic and upon recent repeat viewings, an actual movie with characters and emotion and stuff. That was a nice surprise after watching every single other Godzilla movie."
1.0,gojira,Best Kaiju movie ever...hands down!
1.0,gojira,"The original Kaiju film as only Ishiro Honda could have told it. Here Godzilla is a tragic character, an animal who is trapped in a hostile world of technology that is not his own. Gojira is both an amazing and poignant film. That is, unless Raymond Burr comes around."
1.0,gojira,This is probably the best of all the Godzilla movies. I had to buy it when i saw the new DVD. This movie is too good for anyone to miss out on. It is a classic.
1.0,gojira,"The original Kaiju film as only Ishiro Honda could have told it. Here Godzilla is a tragic character, an animal who is trapped in a hostile world of technology that is not his own. Amazing and poignant. That is, unless Raymond Burr comes around."
1.0,gojira,"First-rate cinema, mainly due to Ishiro Honda's smart direction, Akira Ifukube's dread-filled score, and Eiji Tsubayara's special effects. Be sure to check the original Japanese cut and not the hacked up American version. The first Kaiju film is the most thoughtful and interesting."
1.0,gojira,This is the only version that should be viewed. The American version feels like a lobotomized abortion compared to the original Japanese cut.
1.0,gojira,One of the best monster movies.
1.0,gojira,"While I love the Raymond Burr version- and the many sequels- as camp fun, seeing this is like an epiphany. Who knew that a giant monster movie could be so profound, political and, yes, deep."
1.0,gojira,"Forget what you think you know about Godzilla movies, this is a beautiful anti-nuke film which really is king of the monsters. Timeless."
1.0,gojira,The original without Raymond Burr is an absolute masterpiece. What a way to symbolize the horror and destruction of the a-bomb after WWII. I highly recommend picking up the Special Anniversary Edition so that you can see both versions and (hopefully) agree with me. ^^
1.0,gojira,"The best Kaiju film ever, and I'm not jumping on the bandwagon when I say this. It truly is the greatest Kaiju eiga ever made. Don't believe me? Watch it and you'll see."
1.0,gojira,"I really recommend seeing the orgional film, it may defy expectations."
1.0,gojira,accept no imitations. the one and only gojira from the master of kaiju ishiro honda and toho studios
1.0,gojira,"I love the entire series to tell the truth, but the first installment is a nearly perfect bit of film and one of the best movies ever to come out of Japan."
1.0,gojira,The greatest Godzilla film of all time. And number 1 on my top ten list. Gojira is a classic monster film that gets way less credit than it deserves. A brilliant masterpiece in my eyes.
1.0,gojira,The embodiement of the feelings of horror and destruction of the atomic bomb in the form of a 30 story tall lizard.
1.0,gojira,If you can ignore the outdated special effects this is a great monster movie.
1.0,gojira,Japan has never escaped the shadow cast by the mushroom cloud. This is the embodiement of their terror. Not to be mistaken for the fluffier stuff that came later in the series.
1.0,gojira,"Best Godzilla movie ever, and a great allegory about nuclear weapons."
1.0,gojira,"This is a very good movie. Although it is a giant dinosaur, the Japanese know how to make a good monster movie. I can understand why this movie has a anti-nuke message, especially since the movie was released during the Cold War. I think this is a must see classic for everyone!"
1.0,gojira,"Godzilla is the greatest badass in monster history. Not even the Seventh Voyage of Sinbad dragon trumps the theme song and the radiation breath of this lizard. Sorry, Ray."
1.0,gojira,Amazing! I love this movie. YES!
1.0,gojira,one of the greats. all time classic must see monster film. next to king kong one of the most influential important films that few have seen. see the japanese version it truly is a masterpiece
1.0,gojira,the greatest monster film. original japanese version is the only version in my opinion. masterpiece
1.0,gojira,Original 1954 Japanese version of Godzilla without Raymond Burr present (but usa version is also included here). Ishiro Honda's film is a cinema classic.
1.0,gojira,"Somber, sad, haunting, and utterly essential. Really."
1.0,gojira,"The original ""Godzilla"" is still the best. An absolutely groundbreaking and revolutionary film, a monster movie with a message, it's somewhat cheapened by it's multitude of sequels."
1.0,gojira,"Far different from the Raymond Burr ""americanization"" an atomic allegory"
1.0,gojira,"The original Godzilla film was made as a horror film with symbolism to show the negative side to nuclear weapons, long before the campier and sillier films of the 60s and 70s."
1.0,gojira,One of the few horror movies that has a message that still has meaning.
1.0,gojira,Great film of iconic proportions
1.0,gojira,Finally we in the West can watch it without the American cut-ins and dub! Amazing film.
1.0,gojira,First and best. Ingore the man in suit and just watch the greatest film ever made in it full glory.
1.0,gojira,"The original, and still the best."
1.0,gojira,"Sort one of my favorite movies of all time. EVER. King Kong can bite my ass, at least Godzilla said something new, rather than ""it's beauty and the beast, but with GORILLAS and DINOSAURS""! I'll take socio-political commentary over flights of fantasy in at least THIS instance."
1.0,gojira,YEAH! Godzilla/Gojira rules either way! It's about time the original showed up on America's shores . . .
1.0,gojira,By far the greatest monster film ever created. This film does homage to the horror of the hydrogen bomb by artfully suggesting worldwide non-proliferation as the answer.
1.0,gojira,classic monster movie from Japan
1.0,gojira,Gojira (Godzilla) is far better than the American counterpart. I hope Toyo releases a restored version to DVD.
1.0,gojira,A true masterpiece on the horrors of war. Still relevent today. Don't be fooled by what you may have heard about Godzilla. Give this one a chance.

1.0,eyes_without_a_face_1962,"It's like someone took a B-film story and made a French art film out of it. Echoing H.G. Wells' ""The Island of Dr. Moreau"", this chilling tale of sorrow, vanity, and medical experimentation explores the dangers of terrible acts with well meant intentions."

1.0,twilight_samurai,"This film along with The Hidden Blade (same director) are two of the best samurai movies out there. When I say samurai movie, I mean one that is not only historically accurate, but the story is deep and moving. If you rather watch action rubbish, then go google some ninja vs samurai crap."
1.0,twilight_samurai,"A beautiful display of the Edo period, and a fine job from Hiroyuki Sanada."
1.0,twilight_samurai,One of the best new millennium films I've ever seen.

1.0,twilight_samurai,this is just a beautiful film.
1.0,twilight_samurai,Incredible little film. Don't see it for the action though. Subtitled.
0.0,twilight_samurai,"Couldn't even make it through the first hour. ""The director Yoji Yamada's devotion to somber, everyday detail will test the patience of many viewers of this slow-going character drama."""
1.0,twilight_samurai,"IMHO, this is much better than Love and Honour!! Definitely one of the best samurai film. It gets you every time. It warms you and it lingers in your mind for days after watching it."
1.0,twilight_samurai,"Fantabulosa, estupendástica. Totalmente recomendable, sobretodo si te gusta el género. :)"
1.0,twilight_samurai,"A sweet, gripping drama that shines light on a unique portion of the Samurai culture. As a Westerner, mostly exposed to the Samurai as killing machines, this film is very refreshing. Easily one of the best films I have ever seen."
1.0,twilight_samurai,Classic samurai drama.
1.0,twilight_samurai,Absolutely stunning movie.
1.0,twilight_samurai,Brilliant. Just brilliant.
1.0,twilight_samurai,"A story of a man who gives up everything he has for his daughters. The hero, Seibei, is a man worthy of looking up to even though everyone sees him as an outcast."

1.0,twilight_samurai,One of my two favorite samurai movies
1.0,twilight_samurai,Yamada + Relationships= I love it.
1.0,twilight_samurai,"A very moving piece showing a time where samurai are more like public employees than warriors. Seibei, the main character, embodies very well a samurai who knew what was coming and embraced peace. Along with ""Harakiri"", a very recommended unusual samurai movie."
1.0,twilight_samurai,"It's wonderful. As nearly perfect a movie as I've seen in awhile. It moves slowly, but that didn't bother me. It just made the conclusion more powerful."
1.0,twilight_samurai,"Focusing a movie on the emotional development of a Samurai may seem like a curveball, but the Twilight Samurai had a lot of great moments. Seibei is a poet at heart, and is witnessing the end of an era. The action is sparse but poignant, and the climax is truly plausible."
1.0,twilight_samurai,A masterpiece about a reluctant warrior
1.0,twilight_samurai,"A beautiful, gently paced examination of Japanese culture at it draws to the close of an era. Yamada brings something unbelievably fresh to the Samurai genre with this quiet, powerful little exploration of a family in crisis."

1.0,twilight_samurai,"Bit by bit, to guide you into the real world of past Japanese samurai. Quiet, classical and low key movie, I really enjoy the atmosphere of this brilliant film."
1.0,twilight_samurai,Hands down one if the best Samurai movies ever.
1.0,twilight_samurai,"At the twilight of Samurai era, the everyday odissey of man true to the values of a class who lost its purpose. With the deepness of scope and a mood reminiscent of ""The man who shot Liberty Vallance"". Chambara goes intimistic, with an inspired Sanada in the lead."
1.0,twilight_samurai,I can't believe how good this movie is.

1.0,twilight_samurai,"Beautiful movie. This is a rare man...who puts everything in life that is made so important aside...and does the best he can for those he loves. The acting is so good..the story is rich, the scenery is beautiful. You get done watching this and feel so good."
1.0,twilight_samurai,Very good. Captured Japanese culture well.

1.0,twilight_samurai,"a moving story of the life of a samurai, showing the japanese culture and traditions. not a samurai fighting film, very little action."
1.0,twilight_samurai,"Academy Award nominee for Best Foreign Film, and deserved to win. The fight scenes are low-key and the conclusion melancholy, but it brilliantly depicts the struggle of the samurai after an age of war has disappeared."
1.0,twilight_samurai,"This is probably the best film I have ever seen. Understated, beautiful and very moving. The performances are flawless and the direction unobtrusive. Bloody brilliant!"
1.0,twilight_samurai,"it was such a great movie... !!I really loved it. The way of speaking Japanese was in a strong dialect from Shonai area. sometimes hard for us to understand, however, I was touched by the story with Hiroyuki Sanada.(Main actor)"

1.0,twilight_samurai,"Sanada Hiroyuki. Proof, if proof be need be!"
1.0,twilight_samurai,One of my favaroutes. the plot is so well written and the story plays out like no other. The stick fight scene is priceless.
1.0,twilight_samurai,Engaging story with an alternative take on the life of a samurai.
1.0,twilight_samurai,A human look at at often caricatured phenom... also see Zatoichi and The Hidden Blade...
1.0,twilight_samurai,A thoughtful and compelling movie. It's about a man who does everything he can to take care of his family while avoiding hurting anyone. I really loved it.
1.0,twilight_samurai,In my opinion it's one of the greatest samurai films ever made.
1.0,twilight_samurai,"Anoche vimos esta pelicula, magistralmente cautiva el tiempo entre el antiguo Japon y la Restauracion Meiji. Un atipico Samurai para la epoca, se adelanto por su claro concepto futurista. La recomiendo!  Veronica"
1.0,twilight_samurai,Brilliant. That is all one needs to say. Soulful and polished sword fighting and great acting make this a solid movie.
1.0,twilight_samurai,Beautiful intelligent film!
1.0,twilight_samurai,One of the best samurai movies. Brilliant
1.0,twilight_samurai,Don't know why I thought this had something to do with zombies when I first rented it...? Great movie.
1.0,twilight_samurai,"Although slow paced and not as much action as one would expect in a samurai film, TS delivers amazing acting and breath taking fights, and a story that remains simple, intelligent, and yet surprisingly unpredictable. This is by far my favorite movie of all time!"
1.0,twilight_samurai,A new favourite of mine. Each frame of this film has been meticulously planned. The acting is great. The story is simple... but that is where the genius of this movie lies.
1.0,twilight_samurai,nice story....if you like this movie Hidden Blade is another movie to watch

1.0,twilight_samurai,Top film. This and When the Last Sword is Drawn make a great double header.
1.0,twilight_samurai,"fantastic movie,great story about the power of family. with a couple of brilliant swordfights thrown in"
1.0,twilight_samurai,"Most of it was filmed and set in Akita. Touhoku-ben rocks, I wish more movies would be filmed in our beautiful dialects."
1.0,twilight_samurai,"A poetic film, beautiful in its clarity and poignant in its simplicity."
1.0,twilight_samurai,"There is no resisting liking this wonderful portrayal of a low-ranking samurai in the tumultous end of the Tokugawa era, his family and his life. His philosophy and way of the sword is admirable. Also, enjoy fully the scenery - it's almost as beautiful in reality!"
1.0,twilight_samurai,"A modern masterpiece, it could have been done by Kurosawa"
1.0,twilight_samurai,"I hate saying this, but the EXISTENTIAL samurai film. The Samurai as an office clerk rather than his romantic standard. Real interesting stuff. Subtly funny. Subtly sad. Ultimately Meijei."
1.0,twilight_samurai,"A beautiful drama. Slow and steady wins the race with this one. Little violence, lots of character."
1.0,twilight_samurai,"An absolutely amazing and engrossing movie from start to finish, pretty rare to find in America but if you can give it a view... much more than a simple samurai movie."
1.0,twilight_samurai,"The quietness shows a great lot about Japan and its samurai culture, unlike The Last Samurai."
1.0,twilight_samurai,"A lovely, sweet, suspenseful and atypical samurai film."
1.0,twilight_samurai,Another of my House Favorites. Hiroyuki Sanada is marvelous as a humble widower whose overlord calls upon him to kill a man. Well worth the leisurely pace at which the narrative unwinds.
1.0,twilight_samurai,Just a great film showing another side of samurai life most of us never associate with the realities of such a life.
1.0,twilight_samurai,5 Stars... Excellent movie. Very emotional. I love the main charecters humility. Beautiful script. I must say this just may be in my top 10.
1.0,twilight_samurai,Wow. Perhaps one of the most true and realistic depictions of what Bushido really means. This movie made me cry and re-think my position and perception on the concept of Bushido. Sanada Hiroyuki is an amazing actor.
1.0,twilight_samurai,"I totally have to agree with my frined Danny on this film. It is a true under dog story, and an amazing film. I can't say enough about how much i really enjoyed watching this film. I don't think there was a part that i didn't like."

1.0,the_vanishing,"A riveting, disturbing, and perfectly paced thriller with superb performances. Effectively explores obsession and evil in equal measures. Best watched without any prior knowledge of its deeply unsettling ending!"
1.0,the_vanishing,"An extremely intelligent thriller that deftly blends intensity with patience to make for a fascinating look into a psychopath's mind, George Sluzier's The Vanishing is a must-see for anyone looking for an affecting and memorable feature."
1.0,the_vanishing,The end is harrowing.
1.0,the_vanishing,You don't realise just how good this film is until you think about months after and you start to feel very strange.

1.0,the_vanishing,a freaking mindblowing existentialist thriller that can't be shrugged off of memory!
1.0,the_vanishing,thrilling shocking and still super relaxing
1.0,the_vanishing,One of the better serial killer films-- if not the best one of the 80s-- which makes the American version seem like a children's cartoon. A must-see for serial killer films...
1.0,the_vanishing,"Excellent, tight thriller with some great acting and a fantastic storyline and ending. Very engaging. This deserves to be remade in North America again. A good version this time."

1.0,the_vanishing,This movie is fantastic.
1.0,the_vanishing,I just freaked out at the ending!
0.0,the_vanishing,Had to leave this one behind on the road trip -before the ending. Typically overall drawn out horror which leaves one thinking there are some very mentally disturbed humans who think up this crap.
1.0,the_vanishing,"It is dark, it is intense.Amazing script and very well directed. Slow to begin with but the last half hour is immense with one of the most tragic endings ever. You always get the feeling that you know everything, but yet you know very little...."
1.0,the_vanishing,AMMAGAWD WHY YOU PUNCH ME IN GUT LIKE THAT ;(

1.0,the_vanishing,Simple yet completely terrifying. A perfect movie in structure and execution.

1.0,the_vanishing,All I can say is don't watch it. It will blow your mind & give you nightmares. I don't think I am tough enough to handle the truth. ;{
1.0,the_vanishing,"If you want to see a truly great film, bypass the pathetic Hollywood remake and see Spoorloos. This is infinitely more terrifying and makes the moral point of this film that more effective."
1.0,the_vanishing,"Exquisitely creepy, Banality of Evil!"
1.0,the_vanishing,An unconventional thriller with an excellent understated performance by Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu. It's a shame he wasn't in more movies.

1.0,the_vanishing,um dos finais mais do mal de todos os tempos? check!
0.0,the_vanishing,"Just finished watching ""The Vanishing"" at the school. I am firmly convinced that it was either completely lost in translation or that it's original release title was ""What Happens When We Put LSD On The Escargot."""
1.0,the_vanishing,"A gripping psychological thriller with an ending that is perhaps the bleakest yet darkly funniest I've ever seen. I saw it years ago, and am still blown away by it... a true masterpiece.It was re-made 5 years later in the US by the same director. Possibly the worst remake EVER."
1.0,the_vanishing,Simply perfect? Very much possible..

1.0,the_vanishing,Crazy psychological thriller! Great acting and cinematography!
1.0,the_vanishing,"One of the best psychological thrillers ever made, but only if you don't know the famous ending ahead of time. So if you like thrillers and you don't know anything about this film, SEE IT! Don't read anything about it first, just see it."

1.0,the_vanishing,"A perfect film.So rare for a film to be so original, especially when it's over 20 years old."
1.0,the_vanishing,"Fantastic, depressing but fantastic, a stunning portrayal of the inner senses that is more pervasive and hideous than anything on the outside can and will ever be."
1.0,the_vanishing,I think this is the scariest movie I've ever seen. I still think about the final scene of the film.
1.0,the_vanishing,"Disturbing in its frankness with which it examines the psyche of its villain, The Vanishing's true horror lies in its reality. It is perhaps the most calculating psychological thriller I've ever seen."
1.0,the_vanishing,"The Freakiest, Scariest movie I've ever seen."
1.0,the_vanishing,"What I love most about this movie is that it is an almost pure psychological drama, with minimal violence of any kind."
1.0,the_vanishing,"Imagine the deep psychological horror of the last five minutes of Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" (which thematically ""Spoorloos"" definitely has something in common) stretched out to feature length. Brilliant and horrifying on every level."
1.0,the_vanishing,This will haunt me for the rest of my days.
1.0,the_vanishing,Even watching this movie after already knowing what happens at the end did not make it any less amazing...very deserving of all 5 stars and easily one of the best I've ever seen :-)

1.0,the_vanishing,The ending was unexpected to say the least. One of the strongest thrillers out there.

1.0,the_vanishing,"Everyone talks about the ending and for good reason but the truth is that The Vanishing is an absorbing, captivating thriller from start to finish. It is bloodless, yet accesses some of humanity's most deeply rooted fears."
1.0,the_vanishing,Draws you in then hits you with a climax you will never forget. Not for those who are looking for something uplifting....

1.0,the_vanishing,"The haunting thriller that started it all, brilliant and disturbing with an ending that simply has to be seen. The American remake was mediocre at best, this original Spoorloos is one of the best thrillers ever made."
1.0,the_vanishing,Truly chilling film unlike the pathetic US remake

1.0,the_vanishing,"Yes, it's an art film BUT it is also the best portrayal of a sociopath in film. Stick with it because it is a wrenching tale of desperation and loss. Truly terrifying. Please don't ever see the American version."
1.0,the_vanishing,Holy Christ is this movie disturbing. And brilliant. And terrifying. And unnerving. And emotionally devastating. And it over flows with important life lessons about whether or not you should talk to strangers.

1.0,the_vanishing,"A brilliantly told story which builds tension and dread steadily throughout, any other ending would not have been as effective."

1.0,the_vanishing,"an excellent, if understated film. The ending was incredible as was the structure of the film. A movie that proves a thriller doesn't have to be fast-paced and action packed to be suspenseful and absorbing..."
1.0,the_vanishing,Creepy.... but done very well... no Hollywood barriers.
1.0,the_vanishing,"I'm so glad I found this at my library. It was one of the most well made thrillers I had seen in ages. Everybody knows how disturbing the ending is, so I won't repeat the common opinion. Still, I highly recommend this to anyone who likes creepy or suspenseful movies."

1.0,the_vanishing,Spooky - dont trust the french..

1.0,the_vanishing,Gotta be one of the best films of all time (pity they made a crappy remake!). You can find new things everytime you watch this and it is sooo dark!
1.0,the_vanishing,The most disturbing movie that i have ever seen. This film left a class of college students speechless.
1.0,the_vanishing,Intensely unsettling with an amazing look at the psychology of the kidnapper. One of the most disturbing/depressing films I've seen.
1.0,the_vanishing,"""My name is Rex Hoffman, and that's a bit weird..."" One of the best thrillers ever made. It's not even close to the textbook horror film, and will genuinely shake you to the bone."
1.0,the_vanishing,This movie will leave you disturbed for a long time afterwords.
1.0,the_vanishing,top 10 film from the 80's
1.0,the_vanishing,"A superior film to the American remake of the same title. It is so disturbing and chilling, yet has traces of black comedy. All in all this is pretty much a perfect film!"
1.0,the_vanishing,Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu is perfect and saves this film from minor flaws.
1.0,the_vanishing,"Terrifying. The scariest thing is that you find yourself feeling the professor is an anti-hero, a misunderstood man rather than a psychopath. The ending is as good as endings get. DO NOT WATCH THE U.S. RE-MAKE!!"
1.0,the_vanishing,it's excellent! probably one of the best films i've seen (and i've seen loads!) makes you ask yourself - what would I do in the same situation? and I think I would drink that coffee...to fing out...
1.0,the_vanishing,"The original, accept no substitutes, the remake was awful. Be careful what you wish for."
1.0,the_vanishing,"A psychological thriller slowly unravelled into a nightmarish horror. This movie haunts me for days. The ending alone sends chill down my spine, the kind that you can never forget once watched. Creepy."
1.0,the_vanishing,What an ending. This really frightened me when I first saw it and even repeat viewings don't lessen the impact. Avoid the Hollywood remake mind...
1.0,the_vanishing,"Forget 6th sense. This is what i call shocking ending! A thoroughly disturbing piece of filmmaking. But watch the dutch version, not the Holloywood remake"
1.0,the_vanishing,"Shiver. I still remember the shock and outrage from the audience I saw it with back in 1988 in Canberra, Australia."
1.0,the_vanishing,"A quiet, brooding and completely plausible meditation on obsession and the perfect crime. Like happy endings? Then stay away."
1.0,the_vanishing,"The 1988 Original Danish classic, NOT the PUTRID American remake!"
1.0,the_vanishing,Amazing - set a standard that the daft Hollywood remake just could not live up to.
1.0,the_vanishing,Disturbing and ultimately terrifying - a man loses his girlfriend at a petrol station whilst on holiday
1.0,the_vanishing,"This film is sets up it's white knuckle climax like a stack of dominoes. When the finale hits it does so not with a shocking twist, but with the cold dread of inevitable horror."
1.0,the_vanishing,The original version with the brilliantly dark ending it deserves (rather than the wimpout of the US remake!).
1.0,the_vanishing,this is a classic thriller i want to thank my girlfriend for showing this to me you sick sweet little puppy
1.0,the_vanishing,the ending has to be one of the most devastating and creepy moments in the history of cinema. a brilliant thriller.
1.0,the_vanishing,"An excellently handled examination of human obsession, frailty, and cruelty, this film will always be remembered for the stark ending, but the only thing that makes it pay off is the beauty of everything leading up to it."
1.0,the_vanishing,YOU WILL NEVER FORGET THIS FILM.NEVER.
1.0,the_vanishing,"There's a lot of horror movies out there, but this one is one of the few that haunt you for months, if not years, after viewing. You have veins of ice if the climax doesn't give you chills by simply thinking about it."
1.0,the_vanishing,"Couldn't sleep a wink after watching this the first time. Not particularly scary, but the ending will leave your jaw gaping. Leave the American remake alone if you have any sense at all."
1.0,the_vanishing,Somehow a film free of onscreen violence and steeped in philosophical discussions of free will and the individual still manages to be one of the most fast-paced and uncomfortable horror films made in the past 20 years.
1.0,the_vanishing,The scariest movie I have ever seen. Period. Jesus fucking Christ this is terrifying.
1.0,the_vanishing,My favorite horror movie.

1.0,the_vanishing,Much better than the american remake
1.0,the_vanishing,"Classic cat and mouse mystery with twists and turns abound. This is the original version of the American remake (starring Kiefer Sutherland and Jeff Bridges), void of the Hollywood touch (which inherently dilludes substance). This is an absolute must see for anyone who truly loves filmmaking."
1.0,the_vanishing,"One of the best films ever! Dark, claustrophobic, atmospheric. Perfect."
1.0,the_vanishing,One of those great movies that stays with you long after it is over.
1.0,the_vanishing,"read the other reviews, they love this film as you should.."
1.0,the_vanishing,"to me, this is the pinnacle of filmmaking. there is something so fundamentally brilliant about the sheer horror of raymond's familiarity."
1.0,the_vanishing,"Pure, pure genius. everything this movie threatens it delivers. the strength is entirely in the suspense and anyone who wants to feel terrified without the need for gore but with the sheer power of their own imagination need look no further. A masterpiece."
1.0,the_vanishing,"This movie left me looking over my shoulder for hours, if not a couple of days after finishing it. Nauseatingly immediate and philosophically complex, pointedly disturbing--this is how haunting all movies should be."
1.0,the_vanishing,One of the greatest thrillers ever made. Not much comes close.
1.0,the_vanishing,"You have to see this film if only for the ending. Other than that it's a brilliant look at one story and how it consumes the lives of those affected--extremely haunting, another film that will remain in my top ten forever."
1.0,the_vanishing,Absolutely brilliant- a creepy classic. Haven't seen the American remake and don't want to.
1.0,the_vanishing,"Spoorloos is a masterpiece of intellectual horror, using psychological tension rather than gore to frighten. The film progresses slowly, allowing ample time for character and plot development, all leading up to a truly chilling finish. Highly recommended for all!"
1.0,the_vanishing,"Probably the best serial killer movie ever made. Great characters. Great suspense. Perfect script. Oh, and this is NOT the American POS remake by the way!"

1.0,the_loved_ones_2012,Fantastically done horror. Mixing humour with horror isn't an easy task yet Byrne has done it! One of the most likeable yet horrible villains I have seen too and a tasteful amount of gore which doesn't overpower or detract.

1.0,the_loved_ones_2012,By far the most fucked up movie I have seen this year.
1.0,the_loved_ones_2012,I've see this movie and it's not a typical horror movie. It's set in Australia and the twists in this movie keep you guessing until the end
1.0,the_loved_ones_2012,"Loved it (seen before now, just realised I hadn't rated it on here), best Aussie horror movie for as long as I can remember (if not ever) IMO. Up there with Wolf Creek but I reckon this beat that."

1.0,the_loved_ones_2012,"hello Amazon..yeah,could i have a copy of THE LOVED ONES as soon as possible cause ITS FUCKING MENTAL!!"
1.0,the_loved_ones_2012,Utterly disturbing and brutal but not without pitch black humour. This Australian Horror comes out of nowhere and sits nicely at the top of the bunch. Proper Horror.

0.0,the_loved_ones_2012,"Another utterly pointless teen 'horror' flick. Dull, dull, dull. Avoid."
1.0,the_loved_ones_2012,"A cracking bloody tale if ever there was one. Since this is only the second movie from director Sean Byrne, he deserves a severe amount of credit due to the atmosphere he creates and sustains throughout. More than enough twists and turns to keep you hooked until the end."

1.0,the_loved_ones_2012,Has never been sooooooooooo freaked out by a horror/thriller in such a long time. This movie is a complete psychological thriller/ fucked up experience. At times I was sooo disturbed and shocked I couldn't look away from The screen. BEST MOVIE I HAVE SEEN IN A LONG TIME!!!!!
0.0,the_loved_ones_2012,utter crap. one of the worst movies i have ever seen.
1.0,the_loved_ones_2012,Best Aussie film I've seen in ages - in its genre this is a cult classic waiting to happen - The Cars That Ate Paris is nothing on this film!

1.0,the_loved_ones_2012,it's a horror of all time.
1.0,the_loved_ones_2012,"A top notch sadistic and twisted Aussie horror film that keeps you thinking ""What next?"".  Great acting, great storyline and well produced. Well worth seeing this one! Especially for fans of horror flix.  I will never think the same way about Kasey Chambers' song ""Am I Not pretty enough""."
1.0,1005973-diva,"At some point the subtitles were updated to be more politically correct. Originally a character was referred to as the Spic, later he became the Caribbean.I liked the old version better."
1.0,1005973-diva,"This was what Hitchcock meant when he developed visual storytelling. This was what Truffaut and his French colleagues were trying out in the French new wave. Diva is exciting, effortlessly cool, and astonishingly cinematic."

1.0,1005973-diva,"""Diva"" is one of the finest, most astonishing thriller films that I have ever come across in such a long time, containing a chase scene that deserves to be ranked alongside classics like ""The French Connection"" or ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""."
1.0,1005973-diva,"33 years ago it was a revelation and it still plays well. I've always been kind of surprised that some ""genius"" hasn't tried to make an American version. A delight for the eyes and ears."

1.0,1005973-diva,"A movie that manages to capture a spine tingling stillness and beauty through its distinctive chromatic palette, it's magical backdrop, and it's slightly staged acting.An indulgent, meloncholc masterpiece. A film for a rainy winter's afternoon."
1.0,1005973-diva,"Beautiful...Spectacular... A Masterpiece. A post punk french film which, in my opinion, closes out the French 'new wave' of cinema."
1.0,1005973-diva,Wonderfully filmed and acted with an interestingly diverse cast.
1.0,1005973-diva,Andy Warhol inspired set and Cheesy 80's graphics... CLASSIC!

1.0,1005973-diva,One of the most beautifully filmed movies of all time with an incredible sound track
1.0,1005973-diva,"I saw this film when it first came out in the cinemas, have seen it since on DVd, and even now the trailer still gives me goosebumps (but does not do the movie justice). In parts it's a satire of the French ""new wave"" cinema. See the whole movie! It's fun, quirky, & romantic."

1.0,1005973-diva,The score. The chic. '60s French New Wave updated to '80s New Wave.
1.0,1005973-diva,"Even if the film had nothing else to offer, Wilhelmenia Wiggins Fernandez's haunting soprano arias give this film an irresistible, other-worldly feel. A dream-like, off-kilter film about obsession, kept on track with its subtle, off-beat humor."
1.0,1005973-diva,"One of my all time favorite movies. Every frame is gorgeous, the story is engaging and suspenseful. Characters that are truly unique."
1.0,1005973-diva,This was the movie Red picked. It is almost 17 years to the day from the moment we watched our favorite picks together.
1.0,1005973-diva,My favourite all time move (and also turned me on to opera). Just don't take it too seriously ... fantastic scene where Jules plays Alba his bootleg recording of 'La Wally' by Cynthia Hawkins.

1.0,1005973-diva,"fantastic,but dont watch the dubbed version.This film has so much style and story,the moped chase is outstanding and locations are excellent.Make sure you have the subtitles on it adds to the films aura. The operatic talents of Wilhelmenia Fernandez are amazing and captivating."

1.0,1005973-diva,80's french new wave....love it!

1.0,1005973-diva,another great movie by Luc Bresson
0.0,1005973-diva,This film's glamorization of pedophilia and celebrity stalking seems more and more offensive with each passing year.
1.0,1005973-diva,"i have to say it, it's very french. beautiful scenes and color (i love all of the lighting, and jules' warehouse space is very cool), wilhelmenia fernandez's incredible voice, and great attention to detail add to the twisted plot."

1.0,1005973-diva,"One of the first films that took me out of my seat and into the screen..ambient, beautiful, emotive, disconnected and stylish"
1.0,1005973-diva,"A fun, cool French movie with a postman, gangsters, and an opera diva."
1.0,1005973-diva,An action film directed with space in it. One of the most memorable scenes is buttering a baguette. You won't see that in a Steven Seagal movie.
1.0,1005973-diva,The story is as relevant today as then; and the cinematography is amazing.
1.0,1005973-diva,"A crazy French thriller, a prime example of la cinema du look. Classic Vespa chase. ONLY a French action movie would have a Vespa chase."
1.0,1005973-diva,"I love this movie more than any other. Watch it whenever I'm feeling bad about life. Unbelievably beautiful, fun and smart."
1.0,1005973-diva,"A brilliant French thriller cleverly deals with copyright issues, as the performance of an opera diva is taped without approval. Suddenly everybody's after the bootleg tape. Watch out, Jules!"
1.0,1005973-diva,"just cool, and super music"
1.0,1005973-diva,Would love to see it again. I just remember it being visually magnificent and VERY funny.
1.0,1005973-diva,when I saw it the first time it was the coolest and best film ever. Having seen it acouple if times more recently it becomes clear how much before its time it was
1.0,1005973-diva,"Fabulous, loads of plot twists, cool Zen man and the best car in the world!"
1.0,1005973-diva,this is about respect & love of music
1.0,1005973-diva,Ice-cool and absorbing mystery wrapped around 2 tapes and as many love stories...
1.0,1005973-diva,"One of my all-time faves for its great music and ""french-ness"". A classic."
1.0,1005973-diva,The coolest film for a style conscious cat
1.0,1005973-diva,"Still awesome after all these years - the music, the plot and the gorgeous cinematography make this a real treat."
1.0,1005973-diva,"COOL Just COOL -- This is the best of the free-wheeling optimistic, liberal, open-minded 80's France. The last good big-bucks French movie ever made (sighs...)"
1.0,1005973-diva,25 years later it is still fantastic to see again.
1.0,1005973-diva,"Visually stunning, hyperkinetic thriller has it all. It's a shame that Wilhelmina Wiggins-Fernandez (the diva herself) cannot act -- but she has such a transcendent voice that it hardly matters. Every other aspect is perfect."
1.0,1005973-diva,Lovely film with odd characters + a very nice sound track.
1.0,1005973-diva,BRILLIANT movie - one of my all time greats
1.0,1005973-diva,Beineix! Not your typical French film. A bit of brooding but mostly great fun...
1.0,1005973-diva,"Beautiful, intelligent, surprising, funny, subtle - just make sure you are watching the original or a well synchronized version. Sub-titles spoil it all."
1.0,1005973-diva,"A 1980s movie that is pure art. Amazing soundtrack, beautiful scenery, quirky characters, artfully shot. What it lacks in substance (and in the acting talents of operatic talent Ms. Fernandez), it more than makes up for in style and thrills. One of my all-time favorites."
1.0,1005973-diva,Den kjølige elegansen kombinert med vakker opera og filming slo meg i bakken
1.0,1005973-diva,"This film is saturated with Wilhelmenia Wiggins Fernandez's divine operatic vocals. The cast of French oddities have never been bettered, with a roller skating teenage thief, a postal worker who loves opera but steals the diva's dress and a hippy recluse who is trying to make the perfect baguette."
1.0,1005973-diva,A stylish visual and musical feast.
1.0,1005973-diva,"the film that got me into scooters, opera, and baghettes with caviar.. have never looked back"
1.0,1005973-diva,They don't come any better than this

1.0,1005973-diva,Un autre de mes films fetiches
1.0,1005973-diva,It built up its reputation in over a year of cinema release before it became a massive hit. That just would not be possible now.
1.0,1005973-diva,This movie is so beautifully made and the story is so engaging and DIFFERENT even though the theme is universal. I also love the soundtrack.
1.0,1005973-diva,je n'aime pas Beethoven
1.0,1005973-diva,This was one of my favourite films. I have watched it a ridiculous number of times. Had the soundtrack as well. Saw Wilhelmena Fernandez live in concert. She was as good in person as in the film. Read the book and others that this was based on.
1.0,1005973-diva,Serioulsy cool film. The theme song is out of this world.
1.0,1005973-diva,Beineix's first film - simply stunning - could watch it again and again. PS the trick of wearing a mask and snorkel to chop onions does not work!
1.0,1005973-diva,"A wonderful, stylish ride"

1.0,1005973-diva,This was a very compelling thriller and I loved every minute of it. I loved the subplots and the intrincate makeup of the whole story. The motorcycle chase and the opera singing was extraordinary. I am not a fan of opera but she made you want to listen to opera! What a voice!
1.0,1005973-diva,My favourite Paris film ever - Paris in the 80s without being cleaned up by Jeunet. Music by way of Opera and cigarettes by way of Gitanes. Beautiful
1.0,1005973-diva,"One of the most beautiful pieces of celluloid ever! Grace Bumbry the femme fatale who is the object of desire for a crazed fan, who decides to take matters into his own hands."

1.0,1005973-diva,"Although it will likely not age well, this is one of my favourites. A new-wave tale of mistaken identity."

1.0,1005973-diva,I saw this originally in french class in high school. I thought it was the coolest movie I've ever seen. It was.
1.0,1005973-diva,The protagonist Jules is who I wanted to be in high school. La Wally is the most beautiful piece of music still.
1.0,1005973-diva,Classic. Period. Wilhemenia Higgins Hernandez rocks.

1.0,only_yesterday_1991,This movie didn't take nostalgia as memory matter only but also treats it as subject issue.Which you carry it within a package while you continuously waiting for the moment to wave the charge.You could be the opinionated lucky person.Within the normality of things.

Anyway, this movie is very good, although the parts where she's older are kind of boring. Other than that, it's pretty much perfect."
1.0,only_yesterday_1991,great movie. I saw it twice. I love Hayao Miyazaki's movies even if most of them contain witchcraft... He's second to Osamu Tezuka that are both considered Japanese Disney's
1.0,only_yesterday_1991,Takahata surprises again. you can't expect to see in anime something so moving and close to you. Only Yesterday breaks into the field that has thought to belong to featurefilms only. recommended to anyone who has an heart.

1.0,only_yesterday_1991,"One of Ghibli's quietest, but also most emotionally resonant films. In my personal opinion this is the studio's best work. It uses animation to do things not possible in live action cinema, but in ways hardly ever seen before or since."

1.0,only_yesterday_1991,A film that defies everything everyone expects from animation in subtle and brillant ways. Isao Takahata is a genius and this is his strongest work. I cannot recommend this underrated gem any more.

1.0,le_cercle_rouge,"Granddaddy of all heist/heist-gone-wrong movies. Staggering to know just how many movies have shamelessly copied it. Almost a ""template"" setter for its genre."
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,"A delicious introduction to Melville and his unique crime-thriller approach. And Delon, God Almighty..."
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,One of the best movies I have ever seen. Jean-Pierre Melville is incredible.
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,"I love Heist movies and this is one of the best, but more for it's character development than the actual heist. Wonderful meandering story that comes together as the film builds to it's ending. ""All Men Are Guilty."""
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,For a while I was thinking about all the mud that Alain Delon tracked in his brand new car.
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,"God, what a great movie. It has an excellent plot and atmosphere and some serious surprises."
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,"beautiful composition, start to finish. is anyone cooler than delon? impossible!"
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,The coolest movie ever.
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,A great film. Can't get enough of that Melville stuff.
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,"With proper nods to Dassin's ""Rififi"" and at times feeling like the criminal version of a Wenders' Road Film, we follow Alain Delon's downward spiral from escape to heist to...well you'll see. Melville's zen like code of honor is played out to perfection."
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,"There is no friendship better captured than that between Alain Delon and Gian Maria Volonte. When Volonte paces the empty apartment with the red rose in his hand, you know that there is only the loyalty of dying for love in a world of pure death."
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,"Bourvil est excellentissime dans son seul role dramatique. Montant, genial. Le film? Un chef d'oeuvre du cinema francais, et du polar mondial!"
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,Facebook says this came out in 2003. This movie is actually from 1970. Badass French gangster film.
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,"ok this did NOT come out in 2003, but it rocks. hard. with mustaches. and trenchcoats. cooler than the other side of the pillow. see it."
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,85% Not Interested??? Idiots.. one of the best crime movies ever!!! End of..
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,Classic and genre shaping. Cool with a capital C.
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,The finest French action/suspense film. Period.
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,"Surement le film le plus abouti de Melville. Tout est etudie au millimetre pres et ca marche, c'est du domaine de la perfection. Bourvil est majestueux dans un role ou l'on ne l'attend pas du tout. Montant est enorme. Un Grand Classique."
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,Un sommet du film noir franÃ§ais. Bourvil et Montand magnifiques. Je le revois sans aucune lassitude.
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,"Superb story telling by Melville (once again); definitely Noir, in the best sense of the ""genre."""
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,"Melville's crowning acheivement. Everything about this is brilliant. Saw it on the big screen. If it makes it to your town SEE IT. If not, rent it on DVD"
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,Je connais Melville Moyen mais alors celui-la...A regarder meme juste pr voir Bourvil ds un role dramatik...
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,"Magnificent. An ice-cold thriller from Jean-Pierre Melville (Le Samourai, Un Flic), that blends stunning cinematography with barely-there dialogue. Almost the antithesis of the modern Hollywood action film, it is a true casestudy on the extraordinary power of silence in cinema."
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,It's really a great film ... but it wasn't realised in 2003 !
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,See this film. It is one of the best films ever. It will make you a better a person.
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,"Another superb masterpiece by Jean-Pierre Melville. The slow tempo, cinematography, set pieces, cast, THE COOL, etc. Everything is geniusly constructed from start to finish."
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,"I concur with the 'sheer class' critique. I can't decide what aspects of the film I enjoy more. The robbery scene is breathtaking, and the surprisingly careful and electric interaction between Delon and Volonte creates a wistful tension."
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,Melville is brilliant. I think it should be a lesson to modern filmmakers that constant music or fast cuts in a film does not create tension.
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,A Dream Cast! A top notch Director. A Masterpiece.
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,A great movie...only the French could have made this...
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,One of the best crime movies ever made.

1.0,le_cercle_rouge,"Before Heat, Mellvile was already making the ultimate crime movie. The last of a kind."
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,This is one movie that cannot be duplicated outside France and certainly not by John Woo. You can feel the weight of sorrow on the three characters wasted opportunities and no plans. One last job...
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,An absolute masterpiece
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,Il y a plus de sens dans les silences de Melville que dans chacune de nos paroles.

1.0,le_cercle_rouge,Who needs Tarrantino?
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,"Borrows a lot from Ri-Fi-Fi, but does it in such a high style that it does not matter. The robbery scene is unbelievable, with the existential moment of Yves Montand crowning it."
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,"An exercise in cool that goes beyond simple crime drama. Subtle, sublime, punctuated by a moments of beauty and finesse. Le Cercle Rouge is the best of its genre and then some."

1.0,le_cercle_rouge,The best of the French crime flicks. A classic.
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,Cool sleek french Crime calssic from one of the masters of the genre . The heist itself is a real nailbiter and the film contains some truly great acting
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,The type of film I wish they made today
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,"A Melville classic, right up there with Le Samourai. The hallucination scenes towards the beginning, though short, are particularly memorable."
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,Brilliant Meville classic with the glacial Alain Delon playing a variation on the character he played in 'Le Samourai'. The heist sequence is a classic suspense moment unsurpassed.
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,"Magistral, l'histoire, les prises, les acteurs...tout. Tout est tout simplement parfait. C'est le ""Fanny et Alexandre"" de Melville"
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,"grand film , bourvil et montand sont phénoménaux"
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,This is a 22 minute silent review.
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,My opinion: Top 10 best French films of all time. Brilliantly directed and paced.
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,"Melville's films conflate substance with style. The twenty minute heist scene, sans dialogue, is what cinema is about; telling the story through visuals everything else becoming secondary. This and ""Army of Shadows"" are desert island films."
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,"Before I see this I would not think a gangster film can be philosophical, can express some important message of existence. Jean-Pierre Melville is a singular director, the auteur of a special gener."
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,Yves Montand suffers from delirium tremens!
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,"the best of the best. manly, stylish, dark melville"
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,"Jean-Pierre Melville's masterpiece, and maybe the best heist film ever. Worth watching if only for the scene where Yves Montand goes through the DTs."
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,alain delon with a moustache. no more needs to be said.
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,They should've stopped making heist movies after this.
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,Alain Delon is a professional Baller!
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,Tight motherfucking movie
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,"We need more bleak heist movies like this. Grim and sorrowful, with so much texture and repressed emotion. I sound like an annoying critic saying that, but this film makes it really awesome to watch. :D"
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,"Melville is the best director of the crime genre, Alain Delon is the epitomine of cool, watching any Melville film makes you realise how rubbish pretenders like Taratino truly are. If you only watch one french film your entire life, this should be it."
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,"A slick heist film with excellent direction. The characters don't use many words, but much of the story is told through their actions. So cool."
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,"Outstanding film, the best film I've seen in a long long time.Well acted, stunningly directed, alongside The Killing the best Heist film of all time"

1.0,le_cercle_rouge,Jean-Pierre Melville's Best
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,"Director Jean-Pierre Melville did not watch his movies until years later, sometimes not at all. He was missing out with this one. (And the Buddha's quotation in the beginning is not a quotation at all... Melville made it up!)"
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,Sleek and cool. These thieves are just as good as Danny Ocean's crew.
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,One of the coolest films you'll ever see...
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,This is a tightly perfectly composed film has everything a hiest movies needs. I would for someone one to say that one second of this movie should be removed from the print. Everything about is too fucking cool even for itself sometimes.
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,A gritty crime thriller for the ages -- the touchstone for others like it
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,"This is, as well as Le Samurai, one of the coolest gangster films i have seen. Melville is a very underrated director."
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,Melville is a fucking master. Delon puts the sexy back in moustache.
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,"A poetic and thematically rich hesit film, starring the great Alain Delon."
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,Fantastic; yet another brilliant film by Jean-Pierre Melville.
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,"The ultimate existential heist flick. This film puts you firmly in the world of these nervous, conflicted men. This film also has the distinction of having one of the strangest and most disturbing nightmare sequences I've ever seen. Ick, try going to bed after THAT."
0.0,le_cercle_rouge,Quite a poor movie to say the least..... Certainly not worth the time to watch it.
1.0,le_cercle_rouge,The coolest crime-movie ever!

1.0,rififi,"Rififi is pretty much a perfect film. The mostly silent centerpiece of the heist is flawless, and you will find yourself holding your breath despite yourself."
1.0,rififi,Cool French Noir heist thriller. Great use for an umbrella.
1.0,rififi,Great French film. Film noir. Definitely seen by many modern directors.
1.0,rififi,"Possibly the best noir ever made, surely among the top five."
1.0,rififi,Obra maestra del film noir absolutamente genial y un acierto rodarla en Paris.IMPRESCINDIBLE
1.0,rififi,"Rififi is a masterful French crime caper with a gorgeous noir style, engaging players and a wordless heist sequence that to this day delivers unparallelled tension and beautiful realism, beating the more glamorous, action heavy set pieces of its Hollywood peers with raw simplicity."
1.0,rififi,If you are serious about heist films or film noir this is an absolute MUST SEE!
1.0,rififi,Sólo conocedores. Villamelones favor de abstenerse.
1.0,rififi,Jules Dassin - the French Orson Welles and the forerunner to Jean-Pierre Melville. A timeless classic this one.
1.0,rififi,"Superb film and some incredible performances - lends so much to films in the 60's onwards - the robbery scene is exquisite and beautifully worked, acted and filmed. A great movie and I would reccomend to anyone"
1.0,rififi,"Noir + Heist movies I just love them. This is the best, topped 'The Killing' (my earlier favorite)."
1.0,rififi,"Excellent. Classic French ""crime never pays"" movie full of nasty characters and breathtaking scenes. The fifteen minutes of complete silence really is impressive. Even if it does copy Melville's already written Le Cercle Rouge script."
1.0,rififi,Such an excellent caper.
1.0,rififi,One of the greatest heist films ever made.
1.0,rififi,A beautifully crafted and a cornerstone to heist films. I may write a full review later...
1.0,rififi,"Gritty, human, French, crime story set in 1954 Paris. Great final driving scene. Seat belts? We don't need no stinking seat belts."
1.0,rififi,"There was an expression we used in the 80's to describe something cool. That expression was: ""Deadly"" This movie is deadly in more ways than one."
1.0,rififi,"This tops The Asphalt Jungle, and I went into this with almost no expectations. The heist sequence is just as cool as everyone says it is."
1.0,rififi,One of the greatest heist films ever made.
1.0,rififi,A great heist movie by Jules Dassin. Everything is more than perfect in the movie except the heist that the protagonist plans. Jean Servais was mind blowing. The heist scenes were damn good. Less dialogues and apt background score. Excellent use of shadows and hence a great Noir.
1.0,rififi,"One of the greatest heist films ever made, and for more than just the heist itself (a half-hour long sequence shot with no music and dialogue). An excellent example of how sometimes foreign countries can do film noir just as well as Hollywood."
1.0,rififi,one of the best ever. enough said!
1.0,rififi,"The grandfather of all heist movies sits atop the mountain quite elegantly. Justifiably famous heist sequence plays out sans dialogue. Director Jules Dassin displays a sure hand behind the camera. Stunningly acted, written, shot, and directed."
1.0,rififi,It was my first Dassin film and it is one of the best heist film I have ever seen. I look forward to renting more of Dassin's films.

1.0,rififi,One of the greatest French crime thrillers
1.0,rififi,"If I thought the Asphalt Jungle was my favourite noir was because I hadn't seen Rififi! What a perfect Noir this is. Nail biting, groundbreaking and it has Jean Servais as possible the most charismatic antiheroe in any films of this genre. An absoulte masterpiece."
1.0,rififi,It was my first Dassin film and it is one of the best heist film I have ever seen. I look forward to renting more of Dassin's films.
1.0,rififi,Brilliant plotting. Beautifully shot. Great noir dialog. Excellent use of hand tools.
1.0,rififi,"Great film.The heist is ingenious and tense, and made more so by the complete absence of words. Apparently it set off a series of copycat robberies.Another French film where the ""hero"" beats his woman and she comes backt to help him, what is it with them?"
1.0,rififi,MAN this movie is so awesome. Completely engrossing.
1.0,rififi,"Vintage 1955 French film noir that's reminiscent of The Asphalt Jungle (1950). Jean Servais brings a certain ambiance to the lead role that's part George Raft and part Humphrey Bogart with just a little Joe Pesci thrown in for good measure. Good stuff. Very, very good stuff."
1.0,rififi,Excellent heist film. Highly recommended.
1.0,rififi,"This must be one of the best heist films ever. Everything about this film is so well done - the famous (silent) heist scene, the final nightmarish drive through Paris and all the rest. Film noir done brilliantly - it will be interesting to see what the planned remake is like."
1.0,rififi,Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. If you haven't seen this drop everything and go to your local video store. NOW!
1.0,rififi,Classic heist film. The robbery in almost complete silence is one of the best moments captured on film. The musical number with the singer and the dancing silhouette at the club is also very memorable. A fun yet grim masterpiece from Dassin.
1.0,rififi,best heist movie ever.
1.0,rififi,A Classic. I've never seen seen a movie go from fun and lighthearted to despairingly dark with such perfect grace.
1.0,rififi,See this movie! If only for the incredible silent heist sequence.

1.0,rififi,This is the only true heist film. There can only be one solution for a cast so likable.
1.0,rififi,"Excellent and slick crime film directed by Jules Dassin about four guys who try to pull a great jewel heist. Great acting and pretty suspenseful moments, especially the extremely awesome and impressive break in scene, and of course, the ending. Very cool and very entertaining film, I loved it."
1.0,rififi,"Really, really fabulous heist film. It's all French and tough. They don't talk at all during the actual heist. Amazing."

1.0,rififi,"I defy you to find a better heist film. 50+ years later, and it's still being copied. Just an AWESOME movie."
1.0,rififi,"Such a groundbreaking film! Made by the 28 minute no-dialogue, no-music heist scene"
1.0,rififi,"Vintage 1955 French film noir that's reminiscent of The Asphalt Jungle (1950). Jean Servais brings a certain ambience to the lead role that's part George Raft and part Humphrey Bogart with just a little Joe Pesci thrown in for good measure. Good stuff. Very, very good stuff."
1.0,rififi,Unbelievable! Classic film noir with one of the best heist sequences in film history. The last 10 minutes left me with my jaw to the floor. The DVD also contains a great interview with the director about the Blacklist and his rebirth in France.
1.0,rififi,This was a great movie probablly one of the best ever. Its an old black and white film but keeps your attention every second of the movie. It revolves around a grand heist of diamonds and when the mafia finds out it gets all gangsta. Great movie!
1.0,rififi,Not only is it masterful or whatever...I really enjoy this film.
1.0,rififi,Very cool. Flawlessly executed. Very poignant.
1.0,rififi,"Otroligt spÃ¤nnande och vÃ¤lgjord film om vad som hade kunnat bli det perfekta rÃ¥net. Hur som helst sÃ¥ nÃ¤ra en perfekt gangsterfilm man kan komma. Helt obegripligt att den gjordes pÃ¥ en mycket lÃ¥g budget, med bortglÃ¶mda eller okÃ¤nda skÃ¥disar som stÃ¤llde upp fÃ¶r lÃ¥ga arvoden."
1.0,rififi,The king of all heist movies. The silent 32 minute theft in the middle alone is worth the price of admission. Jean Servais is as doomed as Tony le Stephanois. The show though belongs to Perlo Vita for the work on both sides of the camera.
1.0,rififi,"A perfect film. It reaches a level of tension that is unbelievable, and presents the argument for silence in thrillers. Probably the best heist film ever."
1.0,rififi,jules dassin is an astounding visual storyteller. there are sequences in this movie that would make hitchcock green with envy.
1.0,rififi,Classic film noir heist movie. Really tense and very clever.
1.0,rififi,Likely greatest heist film ever made. The themes of loyalty and betrayal seem to reflect some Dassin's own issues with the black list add more depth then just a movie about criminals. Watch this film.
1.0,rififi,Brilliant brilliant heist film!
1.0,rififi,excellent!r.i.p jules dassin!in my top 10 list easilly
1.0,rififi,"More Jules Dassin greatness. The granddaddy of the heist film, Rififi is film noir kidnapped from the US and transplanted to Paris. Jean Servais is the epitome of badass in this movie. Awesomeness."
1.0,rififi,"Classic noir, and decidedly French in it's portrayal of women."
1.0,rififi,"anyone who can pull off a 30 minute scene without dialogue or music without losing the viewer's interest innately knows how to make a film. dassing builds upon not only the suspense of the plot, but the emotions connected to the characters. some brilliant shots."
1.0,rififi,"The absolute greatest heist film of all time, bar none. The actual heist in the film is one of the most intensely suspenseful sequences I have ever seen- and when a thirty minute scene without any music or dialogue holds your attention like that, you know you're watching a masterpiece."
1.0,rififi,Works for me. Gritty as hell!
1.0,rififi,Badass! But the women are all really annoying.

1.0,rififi,Highly influencial and for good reason. Pure class.
1.0,rififi,"In need of work, Dassin took a job-for-hire, directing a script he hated and came up with a masterpiece. Arguably his most accomplished work, it's possibly the best heist film ever."
1.0,rififi,Absolutely fabulous. Just watch it. The ending is astonishing (so is the silent heist scene - but everyone knows that! :))

1.0,rififi,This is a great 50s French noir!
1.0,rififi,The ultimate heist movie. Seminal.
1.0,rififi,"A truly great heist movie. The heist is at the center and carried out and acted excellently - in silence. Positioning the heist at the middle of the movie gives the movie two great acts, as we see the characters after the job not being done."
1.0,rififi,"Vraiment bon, les vieux films noirs sont bien meilleurs que la plupart des nouveaux."
1.0,rififi,This film from 1955 is a true excellent film noir...remnds me of going to the theatres in Paris where they stll show them on the big screen. sigh...
1.0,rififi,Great French Film Noir! A must see.
1.0,rififi,The sequence with the robbery in total silence (because there is an alarm that detects sound) is a must see.
1.0,rififi,heist! Rumble! Converse!
1.0,rififi,Knocks Hollywood crap like Ocean's Eleven into a cocked hat
1.0,rififi,"Best heist movie ever, and no dialogue at all as far as I can remember. definitely wasn't made in 2000 though - try about 1950"
1.0,rififi,"Best Noir ever! Superlative acting (Jean Servais gives an outstanding pefomance tailoring the best ever crook in the silver screen), great plot, superb atmosphere. Dassin's masterpiece would become an example to follow for many great directors such as Truffaut and Goddard."
1.0,rififi,Dassin's film includes the best non dialogue scene in cinema. The Half an hour of silence depicted in the film will leave you stunned. This is film noir at its best
1.0,rififi,Fantastic post-noir/proto-French new wave crime movie. Best heist scene in film history? Yes. Great look at the darkness in mans' heart? Yes.
1.0,rififi,It blew me away. Easily one of the best heist movies of all time. The robbery-scene is simply genius.
1.0,rififi,"Probably the best kept secret in film. Rififi is breath-taking in every aspect of filmmaking. Truly brilliant, especially under the circumstances in which the movie was made."
1.0,rififi,the best of its kind
1.0,rififi,The heist scene has to be up there with the best heist scenes in cinema ever.
1.0,rififi,Forget Ocean's Thriteen rubbish....this 1955 classic is one of the best heist films of all time. Watch it.
1.0,rififi,"Incredible movie, with a great plot. The silent scene is without a doubt one of the most skilled scenes in film history."
1.0,rififi,"Best heist movie ever made, though Cercle Rouge comes close! Shows how to hold your attention without uttering a word"
1.0,rififi,"Classic! The heist, done in near silence, is 30 minutes of sheer tension. Great."
1.0,rififi,McCarthy banned Dassin's films. I guess that should say enough. A group of four criminals pulls off the perfect crime. But afterwards...
1.0,rififi,You think Ocean's 11 is a heist movie? THIS is a heist movie!
1.0,rififi,"Lucky for us that Dassin was able to keep making films in France after being black listed in America by McCarthy. Unquestionably one of the best heist movies ever made that was a huge influence on numerous directors, particularly Melville's Le Cercle Rouge."
1.0,rififi,"great gangster flic, features a detailed documentary style heist scene"
1.0,rififi,The best heist movie.
1.0,rififi,Lets all hope the remake doesn't ruin the noir.
1.0,rififi,"got my nickname from this movie (one of 'em, anyway) and i didn't coin it myself."
1.0,rififi,"Come for the cool gangster brutality, stay for the near silent 33 minute long heist scene. Classic."
1.0,rififi,"The scene of the heist was so real that the French Government worried that the movie would be a primer for criminals. For this reason alone you should see the film. (Also, it is awesome)"
1.0,rififi,"The grandaddy of all heist films,. Featuring perhaps the most captivating 30 minutes of relative silence ever captured on celluloid."
1.0,rififi,Dassin's best. The American-turned-French director makes his best film as he's blacklisted.
1.0,rififi,One of the greatest heist/noir films ever made. What a loss for Hollywood that Dassin was blacklisted!
1.0,rififi,Best Movie Of All TimeNo movie has surpassed it yet.makes all other heist movies look like constipated monkeys trying to dance the macarena
1.0,rififi,It's a classic! What is there to say? This movie was clearly the inspiration for Tarantino when making Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fictions. As was it to Bryan Singer when he directed The Usual Suspects.
1.0,rififi,Utterly spellbinding. That a film can go more than 30 minutes without a word and have you on the edge of your seat says it all. Film noir has seen nothing better.
1.0,rififi,En av de absolut bästa gangsterfilmerna
1.0,rififi,dassin's masterpiece; one of the best movie of all time...
1.0,rififi,One of the greatest films ever.

1.0,rififi,"Masterclass in suspense, especially the heist - never has there been such an exhilarating period of silence!"
1.0,rififi,One of the best film noir's I've ever seen. Quite ahead of its time and you can definitely see where Dassin influenced the likes of Tarantino and Woo. Wonderful mixture of humor and violence. (French film)
1.0,rififi,dassin is remarkable.
1.0,rififi,"Probably the best heist movie you can possibly make... ever. Amazing 32 minute heist scene, no music or talking."
1.0,rififi,The best heist film. By the end of the film your palms will be drenched with sweat. Dassin had a knack for edge of your seat suspense.
1.0,rififi,"One of the best film noirs of all time. Sort of a tragedy too, which is extremely compelling. The famous 28(ish) minute silent heist is so surprisingly entertaining. Great movie here."

1.0,rififi,One of the greatest heist movies ever made.
1.0,rififi,"Awesome, simply awesome."

1.0,rififi,THE caper film. The one and only caper film.
1.0,rififi,"Nobody does heist movies like the French, and this is arguably the best old-school caper flick on the planet."
1.0,rififi,"The influence of this 1955 classic Film Noir is wide-ranging. It is THE heist movie. Look beyond the fact that it is in French, there is so much without dialogue, you'll still feel the tension even when there is. Brilliant should be on any all-time list."
1.0,rififi,This is the heist film that started all heist films. A perfect film noir.

1.0,rififi,"The ""caper"" movie all others should be measured by...flawless"
1.0,rififi,"One of the classic caper movies. Jean Servais' weary-eyed gang leader is an icon of ""noir tough."" Dassin's direction is spot-on, and the final driving sequence is as spellbinding as the long, silent heist scene."
1.0,rififi,one of the best heist films ever and all while done in silence. Brilliant!

1.0,solaris_1976,"A dauntingly complex and emotionally powerful study of grief and human emotion. While it may be quite different from Lem's book, Solaris still shines as perhaps Tarkovski's best movie.One of the greatest movies of all time."
1.0,solaris_1976,I'm still lost in space.
1.0,solaris_1976,"No, it's not 2001. But this is one hell of a movie. Starts out very slow, but when our protagonist arrives on the space station, things become tense. Tarkovsky reaches a level of profundity nearly unprecedented."
0.0,solaris_1976,Good luck staying awake.
1.0,solaris_1976,"Great Soviet sci-fi movie, one of the few actually. The philosophical tale clearly made as a response to Kubrick's 2001."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Majestical, beautiful and cerebral with dialogue that's uber-smart and poetical. I later learn this was Tarkovsky's LEAST favourite film. What a treat I am in for watching the rest of his ouevre."

0.0,solaris_1976,"Interesting concept, painfully dull."
1.0,solaris_1976,Director Andrei Tarkovsky utilizes the medium of science-fiction to pose profound questions about mankind and the meaning of life. The result is a chilling and thoughtful motion picture.
1.0,solaris_1976,"Painfully slow as it may be, Solyaris uses this meditative pace to deliver a hypnotic and innovative film experience."
1.0,solaris_1976,"A masterful exploration of loss and guilt that leaves Hollywood attempts in the dust, an argument could be made that 'Solaris' surpasses even Kubrick's '2001' in the science fiction genre. A close contender for my favourite film of all time."
1.0,solaris_1976,Mindbending! It will trick your mind till the very end
1.0,solaris_1976,"Tarkovsky's Solaris is a mysterious, ambient film with philosophy and psychology to spare. The sets are elaborate and the final moments encapsulate a sense of disbelief and consciousness at the same time. A truly excellent sci-fi (if it can be called that)."
1.0,solaris_1976,"This review is for the Russian, 1972, version...An absolutely beautiful film - intellectually and aesthetically - SOME holes in the storytelling, but mostly due to the nature of the surrealism of the narrative. Highly recommended; and, one of my new favorites..."
1.0,solaris_1976,Andrei Tarkovsky's brilliant reworking of the Stanislaw Lem novel about cosmonauts faced with a strange alien intelligence that communicates using recreations of people from their memories. Fascinating film; eerily introspective and compelling.

1.0,solaris_1976,"It's a lot more punishing than most sci-fi film, but that's because Tarkovsky creates such rigid characters to match his settings."

1.0,solaris_1976,"Beautiful, quite possibly the best science fiction film ever."

1.0,solaris_1976,"I saw this in the theatre when I was little. I had no idea what was going on, but I loved it anyways. By the time I saw it again, in my late 20s, I had read the book several times, and found the film even better than I remembered. (And THEN I found out that Tarkovsky's other movies are even better!)"

0.0,solaris_1976,Appallingly slow paced. Not a good sign when you could easily have cut the first 50 minutes of the film. Semi-experimental in style. Muddled in thematic & philosophical intents. Not a good adaptation of what is a great novel.

1.0,solaris_1976,This is very philosophy science fiction. Earth for Solaris makes person's mind an embodiment.Why did he have wanted to make such a movie? Steven Soderbergh directed an American adaptation of Solaris in 2002. But ending is different.
1.0,solaris_1976,"Beautiful meditation on love and the divine. When asked to choose between Camus's hopeless happiness and Dostoevsky's depressing hope, Tarkovsky keeps you guessing. Of course, it's difficult to analyze the film in words, and I think that's the point."

1.0,solaris_1976,January 2010 - It is alwasy hard to explain poetry and how it affects us. The images and the words in Solaris are of the same nature. You don't need a logic or straight story but you feel it and you cannot ignore its attraction.
1.0,solaris_1976,"Mesmerizing cinematography, symbolism and a timeless feel cement this film amongst best in the science fiction genre. Tarkovskyâ??s shots in space are just as graceful as his panning shots of the Earthly beauty. The film commanded my full attention from the first frame."

1.0,solaris_1976,Andrei Tarkovsky is simply one of the greatest directors of all time.
1.0,solaris_1976,It's my favorite sci fi movie. Intense in it's use of emotions AND philosophical insight. For a near 3 hour movie it flows beautifully and it describes human nature better than any other sci fi movie can.
1.0,solaris_1976,"Stanislaw Lem's philosophical meditation on ""inner space"" in ""outer space"", brought to the screen by Tarkovsky. It's a long slow but the performance's are so good and some of the imagery staggering so that once accustomed to it's slow pacing it has a hypnotic hold."
1.0,solaris_1976,my vision is limitless now.. thank you..
1.0,solaris_1976,will always return to this movie. soo good i was about to explode
1.0,solaris_1976,"Es una de las mejores películas jamás hechas. No es sólo la ""respuesta rusa"" a 2001... es una obra de arte igual de interesante a la novela de Lem. El final del filme es diferente al del libro y ambos son geniales."
1.0,solaris_1976,The best science fiction film of the 1970s and one of the best films ever made. The visuals (and especially the ending) will stay with you for years.
1.0,solaris_1976,life ..but can't see it every day.
1.0,solaris_1976,"This is the response on '2001', metaforic science fiction like you have nevr seen before. You have to be patient though, Russian cinema is never in a rush, they ain't sellin you shit, but this film takes you on a strang journey into the unconsious world of the human."
0.0,solaris_1976,allmost as boring as the cloony remake.
1.0,solaris_1976,"A sci-fi film not really about sci-fi. More about character and meditation of the soul. And yes throw in some Freud and Jung, but a far better movie than 2001 and very underrated."
1.0,solaris_1976,"A quiet thrill, uncompromising in scope and pace -- to the point of slow suffocation."
1.0,solaris_1976,I saw this movie on the best day of my life.
1.0,solaris_1976,A Russian walking around on a space ship for 3 hours...Trippy.
1.0,solaris_1976,"A film about the human condition, a condition of passion and ignorance, hence a film about faith and spirituality. To me the continuation to the interrogation of Godard's Alphaville, une ""oeuvre majeure""."

1.0,solaris_1976,Amazing film. Very atmospheric and definitely not for the shallow SF fan who wants special effectsand action.
1.0,solaris_1976,Forget about the U.S. remake. This is the one to see.
1.0,solaris_1976,My absolute favourite movie; beautiful and fascinating!
1.0,solaris_1976,"Mind bending, watch this instead of the crappy Soderbergh remake. This one is a true piece of cinematic art similar to Kubricks 2001."
0.0,solaris_1976,i couldn't even finish this boring piece of shit.  it's official. russians have nothing to offer.
1.0,solaris_1976,Yes yes and yes. The remake is also pretty fantastic.
1.0,solaris_1976,take 6 hours out of your life and believe they are the most important hours of your life in which to do absolutely nothing but take in. Watch Solaris. Ask yourself where the rest of the three hours went.
0.0,solaris_1976,One of the worst movies ever made.
1.0,solaris_1976,Hypnotic. Filled with interesting Science Fiction ideas and philosophically fulfilling.

1.0,solaris_1976,An amazing and very alien experience. Definitely a film that takes you on the journey.
1.0,solaris_1976,"Moving and thought provoking sci-fi. See the remake *after* the original, and you'll agree it stinks :)"
1.0,solaris_1976,This is Solaris. Unique. Tarkovsky 100%. See Stalker and you acquire the taste.
1.0,solaris_1976,"I like this the most out of Tarkovsky's movies (Stalker comes close behind, though). Beautiful, serene and ""psychological""."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Sure, it's long and boring, but it's also very rewarding."
0.0,solaris_1976,more like SNORE-ARIS. Ugh. If I wouldn't have been in The Paramount I would have just turned it off.
1.0,solaris_1976,Tarkovskys excellent movie!Have not seen the american version.
1.0,solaris_1976,"Tarkovsky captures the ineffable. Certain moments approach a cinematic apotheosis in terms of psychological depth as well as technical mastery. His command of the medium here is still without parallel today, almost forty years later."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Loaded with beautiful shots. A contemplative, thought-provoking film that poses many probing existentialist queries."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Subtle, beautiful, evocative, haunting... definitely ranks among the top 10 in my vast Sci-Fi movie collection. Not for everyone, mind you - no Lucas-esque space battles here - but very rewarding for those with patience and a questioning mind."
1.0,solaris_1976,Just watched this a second time and blew my mind. One of the greatest and thoughtful sci-fi films.
1.0,solaris_1976,A surreal treat from the USSR. Especially the driving scene in Tokyo.
1.0,solaris_1976,My favourite movie of all time. Never tire of this chilling and moody masterpiece of modern Cinema. Tarkovsky's finest hour (though he would argue with me if he were still alive!)
1.0,solaris_1976,"Fuck people who don't like Tarkovsky, fuck everyone who calls his films tedious and, most importantly, fuck the remake of this movie. There, I vented."
1.0,solaris_1976,Una inquietante respuesta a la odisea de Kubrick. El final es memorable.
1.0,solaris_1976,"Despreciada por los crÃ­ticos de Tarkokski *que la consideran una pelÃ­cula menor dentro de su filmografÃ­a, Solaris me parece una pelÃ­cula bellÃ­sima, una muy digna adaptaciÃ³n del libro de Stanislaw Lem."
1.0,solaris_1976,"It's not the size that matters, it's the motion of the ocean..."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Strap yourself in for some exquisite and intelligent and mature film making. Some hate its languid pace, but for me it captures the essence of what the film is all about - subtle exploration of inner space, rather than the usual sterile plot or action driven movie. Unforgettable classic.."
1.0,solaris_1976,Beautiful and stylish! Fucking LONG.
1.0,solaris_1976,"I like the way that the story has little drama but makes you feel uneasy watching it, where the idea of having your past, your stilted thoughts return fascinating. Yet, this was one of the most hardest films for me to watch and my least favourite by Tarkovsky."
1.0,solaris_1976,"yes, this is a long, slow film. but in my opinion, every minute of it is masterful. would easily be in my top 5 if not for the fact that all tarkovsky films are near perfect: choosing my favorite is like choosing a favorite child....its morally wrong."
1.0,solaris_1976,Way better than the remake. An enthralling Sci-fi journey with a psychological twist. Very surreal camera work.
1.0,solaris_1976,"This movie, although very slow and not a real sci-fi movie like we are used to know, is superb. The ""crazy"" talks in a space-can with rooms llike an old caste. The incredible love story between a real and a ""dream"""
1.0,solaris_1976,"Encountering ""The Unknown"" one has to face a fifth colony - his soul...Outstanding movie, quite outstanding!!!"
1.0,solaris_1976,Andrei Tarkovsky is simply one of the greatest directors of all time.

1.0,solaris_1976,Excellent plot. Outstanding photography.
1.0,solaris_1976,A slow and somber dissection of the human condition of loneliness in a very off put and obscure manner. It's a very frightening movie because it's so out there yet it hits you regardless with what Tarkovsky is trying to say.
1.0,solaris_1976,one of the best movies I have see in my life
1.0,solaris_1976,"""Solaris"" is considered the Soviet response to Kubrick's ""2001"", and is in many ways a better film. Many science fiction stories open with a mystery and conclude with an answer. ""Solaris"" only leaves us with more questions, but provides a new way of thinking about issues that we don't understand."
1.0,solaris_1976,"loved it, stayed in my mind for a long time"
1.0,solaris_1976,Un trance espectacular de más de dos o tres horas de duración.
1.0,solaris_1976,"5 OMG's. Just bought the Criterion Collection version, and it's much better than the Ruscico."
1.0,solaris_1976,"A trip inside of the soul, and what it means to have a memory of love in space and time. It also presents the future as cira 1972 Tokyo roadways! Great, great imagery, if not Tarkovsky's very best."
1.0,solaris_1976,"A science fiction love story psychodrama, beautiful hypnotic film."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Waa-wa-wi-wa, whatta movie!"
1.0,solaris_1976,"It's sooooooooooooooo long. There are serious periods of languid shots and no dialogue and then when they do it's all in Russian. Made me cry like a baby, though. Repeatedly!"
1.0,solaris_1976,This is great! Slow at times but beautiful. Doesn't resemble Noir like the silly remake. I think this film raises far more question and even contains a political text about current Russia. More later...
1.0,solaris_1976,loistoteos. harmi kun jenkkien piti tÃ¤mÃ¤kin mennÃ¤ pilaamaan.
1.0,solaris_1976,A breath taking film about love. Not much more need be said. Except its amazing!

1.0,solaris_1976,"A slow moving piece of art, but very worthwhile watching it."
1.0,solaris_1976,"One of Tarkovsky's best, and one of the best sci-fi's ever made"
1.0,solaris_1976,"A piece of Art. An ""introspective Sci-Fi movie"". Why should we look outside to find answers about ourselves?... by the way, you may wear a ""gafa-pasta"" if you don't want to fall asleep in the middle of the movie...."
1.0,solaris_1976,"The original Solaris (not the Clooney remake) is the only sci-fi film I've seen that approaches the profoundity of 2001. The effects are so poor they are laughable, yet the strange story and its characters had me in their grips very quickly."
1.0,solaris_1976,MASTERPIECE......i have only used that word for three other films but the second this film was over there were a variety of questions in my mind......This is what great films do to you...a vast journey into humanity....through the eyes of Kris Kelvin we come to understand our humanity..
1.0,solaris_1976,Georges Klounoff is great in this movie.
1.0,solaris_1976,"Andrei Tarkovsky's masterful visualization of the Stanislaw Lem novel. Beautiful, stylistic and deeply profound, this is precisely what cinema is or at least should be about."
1.0,solaris_1976,"this is an amazing movie. slow and long, yes (neither of those things is bad here). do not see the remake with clooney. i actually favor this over 2001 space odyssey"
1.0,solaris_1976,"A perfect representation of a solitary future... Tarkovsky built a station, a philosophy and an ideal, all without a single solid rocket booster."
1.0,solaris_1976,A sci-fi film less about the uncharted reaches of outer space than those within us all.
1.0,solaris_1976,"It´s a Tarko. Not really a sci-fi movie, but a journey to the human soul. Love it to death."
1.0,solaris_1976,"you thought being at group zero on september the 11th would change your life, well you haven't seen solaris yet"

1.0,solaris_1976,very good film but hard to watch get inside your head but that what it's all about...:-)
1.0,solaris_1976,We know the ocean is the brain... Deal with that!I commented on the 2002 remake by mistake somewhere else. That is an average quality photocopy of this terrific film
1.0,solaris_1976,"Confounding, frustrating, baffling, and utterly powerful. That final shot is brilliant."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Slow and stark, perhaps overly, but stylish and profound. Phantasy turns against itself."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Absolutely brilliant: beautiful, moving, horrifying, and thought provoking. Tarkovsky's film is one of the true masterpieces of science fiction as it examines grief, human identity, love, and the powers that both make us human as well as tear us apart."
1.0,solaris_1976,This is one of the greatest science-fiction films ever created.
1.0,solaris_1976,"Excellent! A long movie, at 2 hours 50 minutes, but worth every minute. One of the >BEST< Sci-Fi movies ever--a beautiful, poetic film contrasting reality and our inner desires. Don't even consider the 2002 remake--in my opinion."
1.0,solaris_1976,One of the best movies about love
1.0,solaris_1976,I love the Tarkhofski's one.
1.0,solaris_1976,"While I enjoyed the American version well enough, I easily prefer this one. While the American one focused on love, this focused on what makes someone human, and the result is a film which is much more complex and compelling."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Brilliant, deeply philosophical, and from the Russian/Soviet perspective. Not counting the ridiculously long driving scene early in the movie, its nearly flawless."
1.0,solaris_1976,Tarkovskys best picture. Long and slow but never boring. Top 10 movies of all time.
1.0,solaris_1976,"hell yes. No interest in seeing the remake, remaking this is the height of presumption."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Don't bother seeing the Americanised mainstream version of this cult Tarkovsky classic.Visually stunning and mentally stunning... hypnotic, oceanic, influential and by far quirky!"
1.0,solaris_1976,Tarkovsky's best... He's arguably the only good thing to come out of Russia.
1.0,solaris_1976,"Tarkovsky is a genius, and this is why."
1.0,solaris_1976,a slow-paced examination of what it means to be humani miss sci-fi like this
1.0,solaris_1976,"Slowly paced, but every second on screen is not wasted. It's not slow for slowness sake, but Tarkovsky forces you to be introspective, to think about what you are seeing and what it might mean to you. The ending, of course, is brilliant."
1.0,solaris_1976,a wonderful exploratory film that shines in its visionary direction and luminous acing.
1.0,solaris_1976,Strange haunting film classic. A must for every film buff
1.0,solaris_1976,"At times, this can be the slowest film you'll ever sit through. And yet, few films have ever managed to keep me hypnotized enough to be unable to pull away. Tarkovsky's directing here is beautiful, and befitting of the psychological depths here."
1.0,solaris_1976,The Russian counterpart to 2001. More philosophy in films please...
1.0,solaris_1976,my favorit film and book
1.0,solaris_1976,The best sci-fi movie ever because of the metaphysical exploration : What are the things you'll do different if you can ? What is your deepest dream ? your deepest need ?
1.0,solaris_1976,"A thoughtful and compelling science fiction drama in which exploration of the unknown turns out to be exploration of the self. It's slow, challenging, but hypnotic. In my humble opinion, the best science fiction film of all time."
1.0,solaris_1976,All I can say is why did it take me so long to see this. Tarkovsky captures my heart and head
1.0,solaris_1976,"It takes a while to get going and moves slowly once it does, but it's Tarkovsky; that's his thing. Stick with it, though, and it becomes a brilliant, shattering meditation on incarnation."
1.0,solaris_1976,Didn't 'really' get it until I owned it and could take my time with it. Absolutely love it
1.0,solaris_1976,Absolutely stunning!
1.0,solaris_1976,This film is very strange. Sometimes it may be one the slowest film you have ever seen... but it is one of the most fascinating as well.
1.0,solaris_1976,this is a deep meditation into your being. the ambience is superb and delivered strange feeling. the highway scene is amazingly strange.
1.0,solaris_1976,This movie is fascinating. It really makes you think. I couldn't take my eyes off it. You probably have to like stuff like ambient music and be awake enough to pay attention (it's long but I wouldn't cut a thing.)

1.0,solaris_1976,"old, but very strong and impressive.. as good as the book but in a tarkowskij- way :)"
1.0,solaris_1976,"Absolutely brilliant in every way. Meditative, haunting, and mystical; this film extends itself to the limits of human consciousness and the deceptive empiricism we like to call 'science.' Just brilliant."
1.0,solaris_1976,Tarkovsky's Solaris rules!
1.0,solaris_1976,"Based on the haunting novel by Stanislaw Lem, this film captures almost perfectly the mood and mystery of the book -- a rarity in sf. A conscious planet reifies our deepest, most painful memories -- are we mad, or do we have the chance to remake a failed past? No easy answers."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Liked this one better than the american version. Also don't try to read the English translation of the book, its lost way too much in translation."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Forget the re-done this is the real thing. A philosphical movie about life, guilt and human relations. Not easy to to to you but just plain brilliant."

1.0,solaris_1976,"A great movie, seen it a copule of day ago and never was disappointed. You don`t really expect visual effect of this kind of level from the 1972 film. But the main thing is ofcourse is how the actors play, how the make think about why are they doing it in the ways they do, great film."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Great thought provoking movie but the ending is just so out there, it confuses more than resolves things. Better than the Clooney remake in most respects."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Forget about the re-make, this is the version to see. The drama's more effective and the visuals are cooler."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Solaris 2002 est très bien aussi, mais je veux pas comparer ici. Si vous aimez les films, lisez le livre certains passages mon donnez froid dans le dos, si si. stanislas Lem nous a quitté en 2006."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Amazing film. Yes, it's slow and methodical, but Tarkovsky is at his best here."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Great sci-fi fairytale. If you are going to watch solyaris you should watch the original first. The hollywood remake has its merits too, but looses some of the magic of the original. highly recommended."

1.0,solaris_1976,Russian cinematography at its best
1.0,solaris_1976,"One of the greatest science fiction films of all time, stylistically beautiful and incredibly thought-provoking, this original version (later somewhat remade by Soderburgh) has the powerfully philisophical dialog that the remake lacks - a signature of Tarkovsky and his Russian foundation."
1.0,solaris_1976,This is like a surreal travel into the human mind. It is clearly not a movie for everyone. Heavy weight film.
