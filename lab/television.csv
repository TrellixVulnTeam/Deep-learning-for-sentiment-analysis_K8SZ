1.0,f_for_fake,Great film have seen it dozens of times there is always something I can look up and learn it seems from this movie
1.0,f_for_fake,"The truth of lie, and the lie of truth"
1.0,f_for_fake,I'd say this is one of the great post-modernist films by one of the greatest masters of cinema.
1.0,f_for_fake,"In my mind, this is Orson Welles' true masterpiece. One of my favorite films of all time."
1.0,f_for_fake,"This is a brilliant Welles film with a strikingly modern attitude toward the truth and a form and style which perfectly expresses that attitude. Very Brechtian, sophisticated, globe-trotting and funny. Welles still had it even in the 1970s."
1.0,f_for_fake,"When the flush of a newborn sun fell first on Eden's green and gold,Our father Adam sat under the Tree and scratched with a stick in the mold;And the first rude sketch that the world had seen was joy to his mighty heart,Till the Devil whispered behind the leaves: ""It's pretty, but is it Art?"""
1.0,f_for_fake,One if not the best film I've ever seen a true masterpiece!!!
1.0,f_for_fake,"With this film, the last feature length film to ever have been completed by Orson Welles, he showed a never ending will to break new grounds and invent new cinema. F for Fake is a stand out essay documentary with great energy and life as well as a central gripping mystery."
1.0,f_for_fake,"While Citizen Kane may be a masterpiece, F for Fake might be Welles's most thought-provoking and wildly entertaining contribution to the art of film."
1.0,f_for_fake,Makes the films of most younger directors look stodgy and clotted.
1.0,f_for_fake,Orson Welles deconstructs art itself in this mind-blowing documentary.
1.0,f_for_fake,"""I did promise that for one hour, I'd tell you only the truth. That hour, ladies and gentlemen, is over. For the past seventeen minutes, I've been lying my head off.""""Do you think I should confess? To what? Committing masterpieces?"""
1.0,f_for_fake,"A unique, experimental, playful doc driven by the charismatic, electric personality of Welles."
0.0,f_for_fake,"Pretentious and ridiculous. Dated artsy fartsy, and I usually like artsy movies. Glad people like this couldn't get away with forging shit, with the technology to debunk them now. I'm astounded by all of the good reviews of this movie."
0.0,f_for_fake,"So, so awful. Exit Through the Gift Shop definitely took a cue from this one."
1.0,f_for_fake,"A delightfully fun documentary, or is it only pretending to be?"
1.0,f_for_fake,"dunno how many times i've watched this, and i've always loved it, always found some new layer i hadn't thought about. all the talk about forgery (and the subsequent forgery of the forgery) is quite simply fascinating. a masterpiece in art theory."
1.0,f_for_fake,one of the most interesting and masterful documentaries i've ever seen ... even welles second masterpiece perhaps.
1.0,f_for_fake,"Masterful; Orson Welles' best film, period. This is pure genius."
1.0,f_for_fake,"It's incredible that Orson Welles was able to make something so completely unconventional so late in his creative career. But then, for all the crap that people say about Welles-- he was arrogant, he was brash, he was a drunk-- nobody ever says he couldn't make a movie."
1.0,f_for_fake,"One of the fastest, funniest, most entertaining documentaries out there from one of the great creative minds of the 20th Century."
1.0,f_for_fake,Greatest documentary I've ever seen !
1.0,f_for_fake,"Welles' free-form essay on fakery, art and authorship is fascinating, funny and beautiful. It's also complex and somewhat maddening. Not for those used to being spoon-fed stories and those who think they don't like documentaries should give it shot. One of the most interesting films of its kind."
1.0,f_for_fake,"Reality? It's the toothbrush...... waiting at home for you in its glass A bus ticket, a paycheck... and the grave."
1.0,f_for_fake,The ultimate example of Orson Welles's theory of film and editing.
1.0,f_for_fake,"Orson Welles is without a doubt The Lord Of Fun. Crafty how he out-fakes the fakes, and fakes us out. And embedded within the fun, a moment or two of sombre reflection worthy of any poet. A good reason to keep loving film."
1.0,f_for_fake,"I am becoming increasingly obsessed with the enigmatic Clifford Irving and, because of of this film, Elmyr de Hory as well. F for Fake is a brilliant construction of film making that explores many aspects of authenticity, forgery, and trickery. Plus, Elmyr is my new hero.. hey art world, suck it!"
1.0,f_for_fake,Trippy but briliant.
1.0,f_for_fake,You could be forgiven for not thinking that this is one of the greatest films of all time. Just don't expect me to be the forgiving one.
1.0,f_for_fake,"If you don't see this film, you can't say that you love movies."
1.0,f_for_fake,"An entertaining and disjointed story of a legendary art forger, his biographer responsible for manufacturing a psychotic Howard Hughs, and Oja Kodar, all used as an elaborate set up for Welles to fuck with your head. This movie is awesome."
1.0,f_for_fake,"So much in an hour and a half that is to be absorbed and enjoyed at the same time, a work of genius on the part of the great Orson, even if he likes the fish sticks better raw!"
1.0,f_for_fake,"A documentary film about fakers, where fact and fiction blend seamlessly into one hour and thirty-five minutes of greatness. Truly shows the power of the medium. But know this, Don't always trust what you're told..."
1.0,f_for_fake,"Not sure if Orson Welles was a genius? Watch this. Probably the best piece of film editing I've seen with an intriguing premise to boot.Welles presence is undeniable, as is his creativity."
1.0,f_for_fake,Orson Wells is hilarious and having fun for 95 minutes.
1.0,f_for_fake,"I can't quite describe this film, except for the fact that it's like nothing I've ever seen. The way Welles presents the material is so astounding and original. The editing and voice over narration really takes center and helps present the material in an entertaining and interesting manner."
1.0,f_for_fake,"There is no comparison to this film in terms of editing. This is it. This is as good as it gets, and nothing has come close, ever."
1.0,f_for_fake,"""Everything you hear and see for the next hour is absolutely true."""
1.0,f_for_fake,"Pure genius. And well cheeky, too. Which is always nice."
1.0,f_for_fake,"This is a documentary about art forgery.Now that may not seem a great subject,let alone a films worth.welles wanders through this film with style and a genuine intrest in the not genuine article. Its fascinating."
1.0,f_for_fake,I loved it... more than Citizen Kane. Sorry for the blasphemy.
1.0,f_for_fake,"The OTHER Man in Black asks us ""What is truth?"""
1.0,f_for_fake,EVERYTHING. IS. AWESOME.
1.0,f_for_fake,What is art? Can forged pieces be high art? Anybody who has seen this virtuous landmark movie will never forget his monologue to the pictures of Chartres.
1.0,f_for_fake,"The final Welles masterpiece, a film about reality masquerading as a documentary on fakes. A master magician at the top of his game, a confidence trick to give confidence to anyone who SEES."
1.0,f_for_fake,The most intelligently edited movie ever. Welles advanced cinema again with this doc/essay; too bad nobody was watching.
1.0,f_for_fake,"It's impossible not to have a welles in such a list. This one is not as famous as Kane, but is as brilliant. Arf, there is also the lady from Shangai... It's too difficult."
1.0,f_for_fake,"QuizÃ¡s el mejor largometraje de Welles, desbancando incluso a ""Ciudadano Kane"" bajo mi gusto."
1.0,f_for_fake,"Had this received a wider distribution upon its release, I'm sure it would have sparked a revolution in filmmaking on the scale of Citizen Kane. There's an overwhelming brilliance flowing through this movie, and I can only hope that it will one day be appreciated as the masterpiece it is!!"
1.0,f_for_fake,"Welles was a genius. And not just a genius in the way the word often gets thrown around. A real genius-genius. This feels to me like his most Welles-ian post-Citizen Kane film--and, as his last feature, it's every bit as great as his first. Dizzying and delightful and magical (and fraudulent)."
1.0,f_for_fake,best documentary ever. orson welles is a god. edited to perfection. definitely a favorite
1.0,f_for_fake,"At the start of the film, a woman interrupts Welles' sleight of hand: ""Are you up to your old tricks again?""""Of course,"" he replies. ""I am a charlatan, after all.""What follows is an endlessly digressive cinematic monologue about truth, art, and shameless lying.They're all the same thing, after all."
1.0,f_for_fake,Fantastic. Orson Welles has created a masterfully edited/directed experimental 'documentary' which is so enjoyable to watch it's hard to put into words. Everyone should watch this. EVERYONE.
1.0,f_for_fake,"I recommend watching a pirated copy of this film. Even if you have a legit DVD, burn it and watch that copy. It only enhances the experience. [I didn't really do this, but that was my first thought after watching this film]"
1.0,f_for_fake,The most playful movie Welles ever made.
1.0,f_for_fake,"Welles is a genius, a clever, arrogant, devious genius. I love this film/documentary/biography - whatever it is."
1.0,f_for_fake,"A monumental achievement. Unfortunately ""Kane's"" shadow keeps a lot of Welles other work from getting the credit it deserves, but thank God for the Criterion Collection for making this film available again."
1.0,f_for_fake,"""Orson Welles = Citizen Kane"" to the majority of people but F for Fake keeps it real."
1.0,f_for_fake,"One of the best edited films I've ever seen. Welles' personality intoxicates you into the narrative, which, despite the theme of fakery, you cannot help but think it is true...."
1.0,f_for_fake,"Totally effortless. Welles is just fucking around with cinema, & still makes one of the more amazing things I've seen."
1.0,f_for_fake,"Endlessly fascinating and wonderful film, Orson is consistently compelling as our guide through a world of fakers, and in the editing we see him turn ordinary archive footage into a dramatic and humourous story."
1.0,f_for_fake,"Amazingly strange, avant-garde movie. Sort of a documentary, sort of about illusions, sort of about fakers, by fakers. Extremely unique."
1.0,f_for_fake,"Orson Welles' final film that he completed, and it's a great one. Part documentary, part film, part essay, it provides as much of an insight into Welles as it does the subject of fakery. A must-see for any Welles fan."
1.0,f_for_fake,"QUOTES: Because the fakes are as good as the real ones, and there's a market, and there's a demand. If you didn't have an art market, then fakers could not exist."
1.0,f_for_fake,"This movie is incredible. Once again, Orson is light years beyond the rest of us mere mortals."
1.0,f_for_fake,orson welles blows your baby mind.
1.0,f_for_fake,A fake film about a fake artist who had a book written about him by the holder of the fake Howard Hughes will. Or is it simply a documentary about a couple of forgers? Where does forgery begin and art take over? The irony is that the film itself is a wonderful work of art that is quite unique.
1.0,f_for_fake,"A wonderful look at the art of deception and why we shouldn't alway's believe the""experts"". The tone is both whimsical and tragic. And should you believe anything I've written? Well?"
1.0,f_for_fake,I could've sworn I'd already given out some hyberole laced rant about how awesome this movie is already.
1.0,f_for_fake,"Welles unbound. There is no other film quite like this. Funny, irreverant, profound and immensely entertaining."
1.0,f_for_fake,One of the premiere discussions of art and authorship. A joy to watch.
1.0,f_for_fake,Orson Welles the magician makes a documentary about hoaxes and fakery. Sheer joy!
1.0,f_for_fake,"A master class in editing, and other film slieghts-of-hand"
1.0,f_for_fake,"Outstandingly weird movie from Orson Welles. Probably his best, no shit."
1.0,f_for_fake,The best documentary! It's the only documentary film I've seen that one can call a work of art - it's the only one that even comes close to crossing the boundary from journalism.
1.0,f_for_fake,I love this movie. Perhaps my favorite movie that's not funny. Orson Welles meets documentary - kind of.
1.0,f_for_fake,Brrrrrrrrrrrriliant!!!!!!!
1.0,f_for_fake,"The most brilliantly structured and edited film I've ever seen. As soon as it's over, you'll want to watch it again. Virtuosity, charm and the avant garde; everything that great art should be."
1.0,f_for_fake,"To this day it is still the greatest documentary I have ever seen, and Orson Welles' greatest work."
1.0,f_for_fake,"Welles, though certainly a wierd dude, is really great...I shudder to think where his film-making would have gone had he been involved with the digital revolution...Recommended!"
1.0,f_for_fake,wow. this little gem is my favorite later work from welles .
1.0,f_for_fake,Work as if you have no money. Love as if you have never been hurt. Quote Orson Welles like no one is watching even though they should be. What can I say I'm a charlatan? Wish facebook would allow me to give it 7 stars.
1.0,f_for_fake,"In this humorous film, Orson says, ""I began at the top and have been working my way down ever since. "" F for Fake is a masterpiece essay/documentary by the great Orson Welles. Watching it will force you to think more critically about the art and artists that surround us."
1.0,f_for_fake,"Amazing, unique, and way ahead of his time, Orson Welles employed styles and techniques that are almost commonplace in documentaries and other films of today."
1.0,f_for_fake,"In a word: different. In more words: imagine a very good postmodernist essay on ""experts"" and art, but filmed. With quick-cutting that predated MTV by a decade+"
1.0,f_for_fake,"It's pretty, but is it art?"
1.0,f_for_fake,fantastic... he described film history in this documentary ... i can just say he is welles he could have done whatever he wanted
1.0,f_for_fake,"This is how cool Orson is: he doesn't have a lap at this point, and his girlfriend is the hottest person ever."
1.0,f_for_fake,Mostly likely his best flim
1.0,f_for_fake,"Orson Welles wouldn't dream of making a conventional documentary, he's probably not even capable of doing so. Instead this ""filmic essay on scams, forgeries and illusions is filled to the brim with the auteur's personality. A total mind-screw."
1.0,f_for_fake,One of my very favorites.
1.0,f_for_fake,"Welles' ""film essay"" poses interesting questions about art and authenticity, all the while playing with the medium to make us doubt its own authenticity. A great film."
1.0,f_for_fake,Loved this. Welles at his artsy fartsy best.
1.0,f_for_fake,"Years ahead of it's time, and vastly entertaining."
1.0,f_for_fake,"My favourite Orson Welles film. Decades before its time. All film critics should see this film before writing any sort of ""review."""
1.0,f_for_fake,"Orson Wells gives us a lecture about fakes and fakery, as well as indulging in some of it himself."
1.0,f_for_fake,"So much fun--Welles as an elderly, curmudgeonly Puck."
1.0,f_for_fake,One of the most brilliant films ever made.
1.0,f_for_fake,"Orson Welles is Jesus. The whole film is about reality and forgery. Is what he says the truth, or a lie? Watch it."
1.0,f_for_fake,"Awesome, odd but awesome, one of the most thoughtful movies I've ever seen regarding art, philosophy, truth and story telling."
1.0,f_for_fake,"F for Fake is prime example of how Orson Welles defies the limitations within any genre he works in. He bends genre conventions until they break. F for Fake is like an Elmyr Picasso,an entrancing and deceptive work of art."
1.0,f_for_fake,Truly great Orson Welles film made when Orson Welles movies weren't exactly in style.
1.0,f_for_fake,greatest movie of all time...magic
1.0,f_for_fake,"Not what you would expect to be the last finished film by Orson Welles, but still a great work. His monologue about Notre Dame probably is one of the top most beautiful moments of any film ever."
1.0,f_for_fake,Orson crafts an art that defies the boundaries of low-budget film making while leaving an impression of discomfort in reliance on modern facts.
1.0,f_for_fake,"a required viewing for anyone, anywhere... & what about the tiger?"
1.0,f_for_fake,A semi-fake movie about a fake-faker who inspired another fake. And this is just a general plot outline... The 9 minute trailer is a work of art in it's own right.
1.0,f_for_fake,There's a great section of movie where you forget when that hour of truth is up. Orson Welles' monologue about Notre Dame just... makes me cry.
1.0,f_for_fake,"Orson Welles brings a film that tests the limits of the medium, making the viewer question truth and fiction, as well as what lies in between."
1.0,f_for_fake,This movie really got me. Gotta love the ending. Orson Welles was a madman and a poet.
1.0,f_for_fake,My second favourite Welles film (after KANE)!
1.0,f_for_fake,"Gets me every time, silly Welles."
1.0,f_for_fake,What a brilliant fatass.
1.0,f_for_fake,"Just fantastic. All should be forced to watch at least once. Plus, DVD comes with the awsome doc ""One Man Band"""
1.0,f_for_fake,"Amazing. This film says so much about the power of editing and Welles's awesome wit. I love watching his films, because you can see a genuine fascination he has with conveying ideas and stories in fresh, unique and sometimes bizarre ways. I wish this kind of ingenuity existed today."
1.0,f_for_fake,Best mockumentary I've ever seen. Welles penchant for the dramatic and self-described charlottanism stand center stage as we try to see through the illusion to what he is really trying to say about fakers: perhaps Hollywood should take a closer look? It is after all an attack on them.
1.0,f_for_fake,An amazing film by Orson Welles. He makes fools of us all. A lot of interesting information...especially about Elmyr. It makes me question what is real and what is not. It's smart and captivating. Your eyes will be glued the whole way through wondering what will happen next!
1.0,f_for_fake,"Possibly the best documentary ever made, not only for the interesting subject matter but the construction of this work, which is next to sublime."
1.0,f_for_fake,"Hilarious. Masterfully edited. A fitting end to Orson's career. Contains the great line: The art world is a confidence trick. Smart and funny, very enjoyable movie watching. It's obvious that Orson had a good time with it too."
1.0,f_for_fake,There's nothing out there remotely like it. Welles was a pioneer till the day he died.
1.0,f_for_fake,"Perhaps the coolest documentary ever made, it seems almost inappropriate to call it a documentary."
1.0,f_for_fake,"Really interesting. It's one of those films you step away from and the more you think, the more layers you realize it has. The commentary and special features all add to what Welles was doing and what a perfectionist he was. But my favorite Welles has to be the Muppet Movie."
1.0,f_for_fake,By far my favorite documentary and Orson Welles film. It is in regards to fakery and the masters of the trade. Capturing how people have conned their way into wealth and prosperity.
1.0,f_for_fake,"Orson Welles best film, one of my top 10 films"
1.0,f_for_fake,"The best documentary I have ever seen. Interesting, informative and well narrated; Wells takes us a tour of the fakes of the world as told by one of the worlds great fakers: Orson Wells himself."
1.0,f_for_fake,"The most thought provoking, interest-holding documentary I have ever seen. Beyond unique."
1.0,f_for_fake,Welles still had it.
1.0,f_for_fake,Orson Welles is God. Seriously.
1.0,f_for_fake,"I am tempted to say that his heartfelt, complex, and brilliant meditation on art and lies is more relevant and entertaining than Welles' Citizen Kane."
1.0,f_for_fake,A documentary about the idea of reality itself. This movie just might change your life.
1.0,f_for_fake,One of the coolest documentaries i have ever seen. I love Orson Welles and highly encourage people to take some time and see this masterpiece.
1.0,f_for_fake,This film blurs the line between truth and lies and does it extremely convincingly
1.0,f_for_fake,a genre to it's on own

1.0,side_by_side_2012,"one word review: GO. this documentary is required viewing for anyone with an interest in how movies are made. if I had to say more, i'd say, ""go more than once"""
1.0,side_by_side_2012,"Excellent film; despite the fact that it discusses a fairly technical and esoteric topic it makes it both accessible and interesting to the layperson. Keanu surprises as a really effective interviewer, too - he obviously knows his stuff."
1.0,side_by_side_2012,"If you are into film, you will love this."
1.0,side_by_side_2012,"An absolute must-see. If you love movies and the ways and people involved in making them, this documentary provides you with the voices on both sides of the film-digital argument. Film-makers are on the cusp of great change, and we, the audience, are on the receiving end of that change."
1.0,side_by_side_2012,Brilliant and thought provoking and at times even funny. Keanu Reeves and Chris Kenneally have made a movie that is a must see for anyone who is even remotely interested in film making.

1.0,the_normal_heart,"perhaps one of the most important films i've seen.. stunning, frustrating yet a crucial reminder of a continuing chapter of human history....

0.0,1006037-doctor_zhivago,"This movie was extremely long and slow. I also hate it when a movie is listed as a romance, yet one of the central plots to that romance is the need for a character to commit adultery in order for the romance to take place."
1.0,1006037-doctor_zhivago,A powerful epic from the great David Lean. Lean creates a long love story using the history of Russia and its transformation to the USSR as a backdrop. A film that is both epic and masterful.

1.0,1006037-doctor_zhivago,"A long, brave, poetic epic with a spectacular score by Maurice Jarre. Omar Shariff, Julie Christie, Alec Guinness, and Rod Steiger give terrific performances. David Lean's direction and Robert Bolt's script are as literate as great literature."

1.0,1006037-doctor_zhivago,"For me, this is like 'Lawrence' volume 2, that is, the same level of film-craft and emotion (plus Omar Sharif), but more poignant. I never get tired of watching it."
1.0,1006037-doctor_zhivago,A bit creaky in places and not all performances are as good as the central two and leaving out a couple of hundred pages of the novel but still great.

1.0,1006037-doctor_zhivago,"Russia in winter has never looked more alluring and neither have Omar Sharif or Julie Christie. Chock full of terrific images and gorgeous landscapes, remembered by many for the haunting Lara's Theme."
1.0,1006037-doctor_zhivago,Amazing. A beautiful story with an interesting plot and interesting characters. To have love for someone when you are with another is tragic but not as tragic as not being able to be with the one you truly love due to circumstances out of your control. A must see.

1.0,bamboozled,"totally amazing and intense, i was in tears by the end of it. beautiful story."
1.0,bamboozled,"Best movie ever about media, show biz, and basically the behind-the-scenes racism. FANTASTIC."
1.0,bamboozled,Its a shocking film...but after you watch it you wonder...what was the point?
1.0,bamboozled,"Classic Spike Lee film, satire and current events always up to date."
1.0,bamboozled,"Let us not fight against one another, instead, find common ground and in tolerance of living in ways other than our own, we must come together."
1.0,bamboozled,Powerfull!!! Spike Lee's best movie to date.
1.0,bamboozled,"Wow, but this is really good. It is thoughtful and clever and provoking."
0.0,bamboozled,"Spike attempts a comic satire. Like most of his movies, the results are not good."
0.0,bamboozled,this is why we don't let kristen pick the movie any more
1.0,bamboozled,definitely a must see! satirically entertaining about stereotypes and racial issues! excellent!!!
1.0,bamboozled,Dark comedy... sorry I couldn't resist. Very intense movie... Garrett should see it.
1.0,bamboozled,the book /with clockers*neworleansjazz is raced ingrain my brain mare x ho scene
1.0,bamboozled,Everyone should be required to see this
1.0,bamboozled,eerie tale of two hustling black artists that fall into the self-fulfilling prophecy of the Black person as a 'Cooning minstrel'. Spike is on point as always. Watch with low blood pressure.
1.0,bamboozled,"crazy intense, makes you feel as uncomfortable as we should be with the state of African American images in the media. Isn't it sad how little things have changed in 150 years?"
1.0,bamboozled,"A very, very angry film and deservedly so. This movie has two intentions: to make the viewer think and to make them lament some of the history of African American's in popular media; without stooping to the level of an after school special. It succeeds in both respects, a must see."
1.0,bamboozled,"Next to Do the Right Thing, Spike's other masterpiece. A biting satire with a ferocious outlook on African American entertainment, it is also a deeply sad eulogy to such dreams deferred and to a marginilized race within popular entertainment. The last five minutes are truly stunning..."
1.0,bamboozled,"Thank you, Spike Lee, for making this satirical masterpiece. THANK YOU SO MUCH!"
1.0,bamboozled,I can't tell whether this is the saddest or funniest movie I have ever seen.
1.0,bamboozled,"A very powerful satire! Great comment on the media's depiction of minorities and creating ""acceptable"" fads. Also scathingly funny."
1.0,bamboozled,"OMG! This Spike Lee movie was the most moving film I had ever seen, especially the ending."
1.0,bamboozled,"In my opinion, this is Spike's best movie. It breaks down how corporations are exploting people peopel for the money through shady marketing schemes. It also addresses the affects of the ""idoit box"" or TV. Love it!"
1.0,bamboozled,i really like this movie...did a project on it in my film analysis class. i always get a kick outta michael rapaport! the montage at the end gets me every time.
1.0,bamboozled,One of the most important films you didn't see. Do yourself a favor and find this film. You will have to know your history though.
1.0,bamboozled,This film really expliots the relationship between races in America. Pure educational film I must say. How can we still be in a time of unacceptance towards each other? We need to wake up! I love this Spike Lee.
1.0,bamboozled,"Raises more questions about the issue of race in America than it answers, and that's as it should be. An especially troubling exploration of the role of race in consumerist mass media."
1.0,bamboozled,the media dosn't have any effect on how we view/opionise people or wait it does.
1.0,bamboozled,Spike hit the nail on the head with this one. If this one doesn't knock you on the head somethings wrong. What's really sad is that if you turn on BET nowadays it's nothing but a minstrel show.
1.0,bamboozled,"Spike Lee's most difficult movie to watch, but definitely the most powerful - cuts to the bone."
1.0,bamboozled,Spike is a genius for this one. Forces you to read between the lines at hard truths.
1.0,bamboozled,"This movie was awesome, the message can be applied to all minorities even in these times we are still being Bamboozled"
1.0,bamboozled,"This was a film that had a lot of weight to it and dealt with the concept of being responsible with media. The last 15 minutes of the film are some of the most intense and there is no more humor, just dead seriousness."
1.0,bamboozled,All black folks should watch it!!
1.0,bamboozled,This movie is heavy. I love how it uses some of the same symbolism as Ellisions Invisible Man
1.0,bamboozled,"This movie really makes you think about classes and why society behaves the way they do. It's smart, a little painful, and entertaining as well. They really oughta show this in classes more often."
1.0,bamboozled,One of the most underrated films of all time. This film really open my eyes
1.0,bamboozled,A great commentary on racism in media.
1.0,bamboozled,"This is a movie that is necessary for any self respecting Black person to view, at least once."
1.0,bamboozled,brilliant satire.... one of spike lee's best
1.0,bamboozled,"I love this movie. I was very pleased with the overall content. For instance,the whole backwards ideology of racism! I love Spikelee!"
1.0,bamboozled,"In my view this is Spike's greatest work. A redundant topic about the "" system"" in the US but interpreted in a blunt and caustic way. You have to be in a pleasant mood before watching this flick. Loved the camera work ( hand held supposedly!!)"
1.0,bamboozled,"I couldn't wait to get this movie and when I got it I couldn't stop watching it. I love this movie, Spike Lee did an excellent job!!!"
1.0,bamboozled,Funny and deep. One of my favorite movies of all time.
1.0,bamboozled,This is a great eye opening movie. After watching this movie you wont look at TV the same ever again. If you havent seen it check it out
1.0,bamboozled,I loved ths film...interesting discourse on racial stereotypes produced by the media.
1.0,bamboozled,I wrote my contemporary films final paper on this film
1.0,bamboozled,A brilliant and daring satire. My favorite Spike Lee movie.
1.0,bamboozled,"Excellent movie for how it depicts the racism that can come in the media. Spike Lee isn't a perfect story teller, but he always tries to send a culturally relevant message, which he does here in spades."
1.0,bamboozled,Hilarious and brilliant. To have so much focus on comedy and then to switch to brutality and shame is remarkable. A wonderful film stirring numerous feelings.
1.0,bamboozled,Just great ... Just great !!!
1.0,bamboozled,This is one of my favorite movies deconstruting entertainment and the definition of art
1.0,bamboozled,Underrated. Damon Wayans is brilliant.
1.0,bamboozled,"As heavyhanded as any Spike Lee race drama, but presented as a wonderful satire of that very mindset."
1.0,bamboozled,"Ingenous premise. The film is filled with so many significant points, and executes them brilliantly. That and the score is absolutely amazing."
1.0,bamboozled,"What I want to know is... How could Damon Wayans do this film and do ""Marci X""?? Wow."
1.0,bamboozled,"Wondrous satire of blacks, and racism in the media. Hilariously dark and darkly hilarious (even that is a bit of a horrible pun)."
1.0,bamboozled,"thought provoking, edgy, groundbreaking. fantastic film!"
1.0,bamboozled,"""Yes continue, great niggerologist."" --Pierre"
1.0,bamboozled,Black people dont like this movie because it tells the truth of our love to degrade ourselves.
1.0,bamboozled,"Strong story, fearless historical and social commentary... tremendously moving! thought provoking. Talented!"
1.0,bamboozled,Powerful movie. If you are bamboozled you wont understand
1.0,bamboozled,Great Movie. showed how a person can truly lose themselves int the world of entertainment>
1.0,bamboozled,"I liked this movie, but I know that if I see another Spike Lee movie it's going to be about the same damn thing: race."
1.0,bamboozled,aww sad sad sad film! but aint it the truth
1.0,bamboozled,Racial and pop-cultural clashing result in a devastating fable.
1.0,bamboozled,"pay attention, people. this one is the truth."
1.0,bamboozled,"""Bamboozled"" é o filme mais forte que eu vi do Spike Lee.  Pena que seja tão ignorado - pelo menos aqui no Brasil, não existe nem em vídeo. Vi uma vez no Cinemax, com o horrível nome de ""O Show Deve Continuar"" ou coisa do tipo, e nunca mais.  Uma pena, porque é o meu preferido dele."
1.0,bamboozled,i didnt think those guys were serious! i love this movie its fucking wicked and real sad!
1.0,bamboozled,A great movie about racism.
0.0,15_minutes,THIS MOVIE SUCKS! IT'S ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES I HAVE EVER SEEN! This move is guilty of what it is trying to make a point of: excessive violence in the media
1.0,15_minutes,A complete treat when I saw it. A film with guts and interesting characters all around. Much better than what I thought it was.
0.0,15_minutes,A generic action flick.
1.0,15_minutes,De Niro is always good
0.0,15_minutes,The humor is laid on with a trowel as De Niro grimaces through clenched teeth at the nonsense he has to utter. The movie jerks by turns through ham-fisted social commentary to bloody violence and back again in the most confusingly toned mess.
1.0,15_minutes,No. 2 on my top 10. Not necessarily in order.
0.0,15_minutes,Good lord! An all time low for a screen icon. De Niro has done plenty to taint his legacy over the past 15 years but this may well top the lot. Garbage
0.0,15_minutes,"This movie is thriller, crime, and drama. It's about a murderous pair and reluctant partners. It's poorly filmed, poorly acted, poorly edited and ridiculously outside the realm of belief. 15 Minutes is a piece of crap! Hands down!"
0.0,15_minutes,"Redan här började Robert De Niro att pissa på sin egen karriär, med denna skitfilm som inte ger nåt vettigt."
0.0,15_minutes,Possibly the worst film I have ever sat through. 15 seconds would have been too long. Bullshit. AVOID.
0.0,15_minutes,The plot in this movie is ridiculous. Don't waste your time on this one.
1.0,15_minutes,A Guilty pleasure i know but this astonishing and shocking thriller has most possible the most shocking twist ive seen and is sensational entertainment from start to finish...in my top 3 best ever
0.0,15_minutes,"Embarrassing. For anyone involved. A miserable attempt at social commentary might have worked - ten years earlier. Robert De Niro sleepwalks, while Edward Burns tries not to sleepwalk - but he's a miserable actor anyway. It's a mess, yearning to be a masterpiece."
0.0,15_minutes,121 minutes too long........
0.0,15_minutes,Poor choices all around in this movie.

0.0,15_minutes,"Wow - insanely awful. Plays like an unintentional comedy (NOT a satire) or an exercise in really bad, overwrought acting. I couldn't turn away from it's stinkiness."
1.0,15_minutes,Surprised by all the blood and gore. Loved the acting. Loved how the meaning of the media is played around.
0.0,15_minutes,If only I watched this for 15 Minutes. Tried to make a statement and failed miserably. DeNiro is the only good thing in this and he is killed off very early on. Talk about a clown smile. Fuck this
1.0,15_minutes,Brilliant thriller. De Niro shines as usual and the Eastern European criminals add plenty of spark to a great story.
1.0,15_minutes,Absolutely brilliant. DeNiro's best film since Heat. A definate must see.

0.0,15_minutes,"Horrible script, bad acting and it's just one big screw up. And I love De Niro..."
0.0,15_minutes,The plot must have been a joke. De Niro killed the director and tortured the screenplay writer after the first screening. Or at least I hope he did.

1.0,inside_deep_throat,"An informative documentary on the controversial mainstream pornographic film, Deep Throat, and how the both attempts to ban it from theaters created the porn industry we have today."
1.0,inside_deep_throat,Phenomenal choreography.
0.0,inside_deep_throat,"Je n'arrive pas Ã  dÃ©crire correctement ce film sans penser Ã  une citation de BenoÃ®t Brunet dÃ©crivant la plus grande lacune du Canadien: ""Trop de plottes, pas assez de moustaches!"

1.0,inside_deep_throat,It was filmed in 6 days for 25 thousand dollars. The government didn't want you to see it. It was banned in 23 states. It has grossed over 600 million dollars. And it is the most profitable film in motion picture history.

1.0,inside_deep_throat,the film was pleasurable
1.0,inside_deep_throat,The finest documentary I've seen. It's an great explosion from 72 (what a great year) onward so if you grew up in the era or have any interest in the 70s it's a great time capsule film..plus you get to see Lovelace's engulfing that brought down sexual society
1.0,49_up,I definitely don't think this series was meant to be binge-watched. It's almost too much to wrap your mind around. It's crazy how many of the participants are upset about being on the series when it doesn't seem like it goes THAT deep to me. I still love it.
1.0,49_up,"And again they look back, this time with gratefulness and nostalgia. I like the fact that Michael was not just the interrogator here but he was actually part of it, observing with them and looking back about how he had been a part of their lives and how his project shaped them."
1.0,49_up,Captivating psychological biography. One of the best.
1.0,49_up,wow. awesome. watch this.
1.0,49_up,One of the greatest filmic experiments of all time
1.0,49_up,Such a good idea! Super good doc. Keep the good stuff coming!
1.0,49_up,Greatest documentary series ever. 56 up coming out soon.
1.0,49_up,Great series though I wasn't one of the people that apparently grew up watching it every seven years. I came by it via a Roger Ebert review.
1.0,49_up,amazing. i can't wait for the next installment
1.0,49_up,Best in a long time. Loved it completely. Only problem with it is having to wait three years for the next one!!! Yikes!
1.0,49_up,it was soooo interesting!
1.0,49_up,"Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in sociology, psychology, cultural studies, or class/political issues. I have to admit, Apted comes off as a pretty pompous fellow in the Ebert interview... but Ebert's respect for the genius of this documentary idea kinda makes up for it."
1.0,49_up,"Glad to see things getting better for every one in terms of every one more 'comfortable in their own skins. One of the less depressing episodes, besides how they all aged immensely since 42, but the filled out features make them look more like their seven year old versions. '"
1.0,49_up,"I have now seen the whole series, to date. This is a fascinating look at the lives and feelings of real people, as they are revisited every seven years. Can't wait for the next one, but that won't be until 2013!"
1.0,49_up,Outstanding series of movies. Should be shown in high schools everywhere.
1.0,49_up,Absolutely Fascinating! Makes me want to watch the rest of the Up film series.
1.0,49_up,I have watched the whole series to date now. This particular movie struck me as to how almost every participant findly found themselves between 42 Up and this installment and how much the age shows on each subject as a result.
1.0,49_up,incredible documentary series
1.0,49_up,these are such good documentary social experiments that everyone should see once
1.0,49_up,the best documentary series ever. i can't say enough good things about them.
1.0,49_up,I'll take Neil Hughes' faith over George Bush's any day.
1.0,49_up,"I haven't seen any of the previous installments, but I was really really amazed by this film... It has a very strange and wonderful quality to it..."
1.0,49_up,"This is my favorite of the series so far. I love seeing how far some of them have come and hearing what happened to others. I also was intrigued by several of them saying they didn't like doing it, but they felt like they had to for whatever reasons they might have."
1.0,49_up,I just can't explain how much I was affected by this film and the whole series of documentaries it belongs to. It's fascinating to see these people as young children and then look at their lives as adults. I'm especially glad Neil is in a better place in his life now. Wonderful.
1.0,49_up,This filmed over whelmed me like nothing I have seen. There is nothing that can replicate this. There is nothing that can match its impact.
1.0,49_up,one of the most amazing documentary projects ever done. more real than any reality television you could ever imagine.
1.0,49_up,A movie that continuously sticks with me. It documents the life of four (?)people since they were seven years old. There's a new one in the series every seven years. The latest being 49 Up. It is absolutely fascinating what has become of everyone. It definitely tops my favourite documentary list.
1.0,49_up,"brilliant, well-edited, and interesting. wow, looks are fleeting."
1.0,49_up,Fascinating. Every one in the series has been great!
1.0,49_up,absolutely incredible.
1.0,49_up,Michael Apted's journey into film history continues with another real film of pure brilliance. Honesty rarely can be put better on film. Nell is my favorite one to watch since the 80's edition.Number 6 on my 06 list.
1.0,49_up,"Better reality viewing than today's ""reality tv""."
1.0,49_up,"I've rated it 5 stars for the whole series, which is a unique monument in the history of film.Get on Netflix and watch them all in order for the full experience."
1.0,49_up,The entire series is a fascinating and somewhat depressing movie experience; a unique look at the human experience.

1.0,not_quite_hollywood,Australian Exploitation Cinema gets if first and definitive love letter in this form of this documentary that makes the viewer want to dash onto the nearest computer and start tracking these flicks down.

1.0,not_quite_hollywood,"They call them genre films, some people may call them B grade films. It doesn't matter what you call them because they are all fabulous! Loads of action, blood and gore, sex and nudity, even John Holmes :p All splendidly put together to form an often comical roller coaster ride. Go see this film!"

1.0,the_return,There is something about tragedies set in Russia. Itâ??s such a cold landscape. The tragedy is felt all the more strongly because of the history and the climate of the land. The aesthetics communicate a surreal empty feeling. Just beautiful.  It's a coming of age film for sure.

1.0,the_return,"Now this is how you do a Russian movie with kids in it! Stunningly photographed and a great slow, inexorable plot. Apparently there's some very deep metaphorical meaning to the film in relation to Russian government that I don't get. Didn't matter for me."

1.0,american_movie,Duh like one of the best documentrys ever.
1.0,american_movie,When I first watched this film I thought for sure the video store goofed and this was actually a mockumentary. So funny from start to finish. You root for Mark the whole time. I for one would love to see a sequel American Movie II: Still making Northwestern.
1.0,american_movie,"Hilarious, Inspirational, and it takes place right in our back yard."
1.0,american_movie,My favorite documentary. Inspiring and absolutely hilarious! You think you're watching a mockumentary but these guys are for real!
1.0,american_movie,A great documentary showcasing Borchardt's dream and his struggle to achieve it.
1.0,american_movie,Favorite Movie of all time!
1.0,american_movie,"The funniest documentary ever made. So many heartbreakingly real, yet hilariously surreal scenes, one after another, it's hard to pick five favorite moments, let alone one. I refuse to own a copy of the film, because I'd probably never get anything done. It's that watchable."
1.0,american_movie,"its all right, its ok, theres something to live for... jesus told me so! - uncle bill"

1.0,american_movie,One of the funniest documentaries ever.
1.0,american_movie,One of more authentic looks at America that I have ever seen. What is often entertaining and hilarious ultimately weighs heavy as you're taken through what many of us struggle for... The American dream.This is human drama.
1.0,american_movie,Mark Borchardt and Mike Shank could be the best onscreen duo to come along in ages....they are the Jay and Silent bob of the midwest and as crazy as Mark Borhardt is....he's not a bad filmaker...at leat behind the camera.....he's got vision....even if it's 20/200. I highly recommend this film.
1.0,american_movie,One of the most inspiring documentaries of all time. Really... I learned two things from this movie. (1) follow your dreams and (2) get a sidekick!
1.0,american_movie,"One of the best documentaries I've seen! It's a shame ""Northwestern"" never saw the light... but to be honest, ""Coven"" is awesome!!!"
1.0,american_movie,I could watch this 10 times a day.

1.0,american_movie,This made me laugh out loud to begin with but eventually I felt great sympathy for the two friends Mark & Mike. Passionate about what he was doing Mark couldn't seem to escape his upbringing and get what he wanted most out of life. A brilliant documentary.
1.0,american_movie,"An excellent glimpse into the mind of a passionate independent filmmaker bent on making his movie by any means necessary, even if it means forcing his family to help. Also one of the funniest movies I've ever seen."
1.0,american_movie,"i have to agree w/mike about the music man... they might be all used up, i think that happened mid-80's, hope we're wrong mike!!! i'm actually going to watch this one again after i finish these reviews in about 10 minutes, i need a coven fix now!!!"

0.0,behind_the_candelabra,"Quick! Here's a movie all the critics can virtue signal on... you know how much they love doing that.This was a terrible, long winded film that lingered just like an unwanted guest that does not know when to leave.A portrait of a putrid man and his victim... who was one of many."
0.0,behind_the_candelabra,Made me uncomfortable. Almost like I was looking in someone's bedroom window. I will never look at Michael Douglas or Matt Damon quite the same again
1.0,behind_the_candelabra,One of the funniest and (in a different light) most tragic movies ever. Two heterosexual actors play the gay leads magnificently. And (for the most part) it's true!
1.0,behind_the_candelabra,Absolutely brilliant. Great performance by Matt Damon & Micheal Douglas. Def worth a watch
1.0,behind_the_candelabra,Steven Soderburgh does it again! Fantastic story from a fantastic film maker! Michael Douglas and Matt Damon were amazing also! Outstanding performances.

1.0,behind_the_candelabra,"Michael Douglas and Matt Damon are fantastic in this. They really did a great job. I didn't know anything about Liberace going in to this, and i found the whole thing interesting, I will say, I learned one thing more than anything else, he was a pretty self-involved a-hole."
1.0,behind_the_candelabra,Awesome and scary at the same time.
1.0,behind_the_candelabra,Brilliant! The choice to have macho actors like Kirk Douglas and Mark Damon play the roles of the campest musician in living memory plus partner instead of casting camp g-stringed body builders like Arnold Schwarzenegger or Jean Claude van Damme worked out perfectly.

0.0,behind_the_candelabra,Give in 1 just because I saw it.....first 20 mins when you learn more about Liberace as a performer are quite interesting.

1.0,behind_the_candelabra,Unbelievable to see both Michael Douglas and Matt Damon to take on these roles! Soderbergh did Liberace justice! Also convincing roles goes to both Rob Lowe and Dan Aykroyd! Some scenes were awkward or uncomfortable but expected I guess. Very Oscar worthy!

1.0,five_obstructions,Takes the creative verve and puts it though the wringer in sadistically brilliant ways. My favorite documentary.

1.0,five_obstructions,"Even the most stringent restrictions and rules, it seems, can be the source of the greatest freedom."

1.0,five_obstructions,"Film as therapy, film as process, film as... intuition and challenge and self-provocation. I'm not sure if I'm going to like or hate the rest of von Trier's movies (only seen two so far), but I do understand him a lot more after watching it. It's creativity as spectacle and rule."

1.0,five_obstructions,brilliant. it's one of those that any film fan Must See to cement themselves as worthy.

1.0,five_obstructions,A fantastic collection of re-envisioned work; extremely artistic and a testament to the creative spirit.
0.0,five_obstructions,I did not really like this movie.
1.0,five_obstructions,This is brilliant. It's got a great rhythm to it. It's fantastically edited.
1.0,five_obstructions,"Theory as game, game as therapy, therapy as art. The most formally interesting exploration of the artistic process, and the critic's role therein, I've ever seen."
1.0,five_obstructions,This movie has changed the History of Cinema. Lars has opened a new era with his works. Thanks to him.
1.0,five_obstructions,"This film is further proof that the more difficult or uncomfortable or generally unappealing a task may seem, in the ways of artistic pursuit a handicap can work amazingly well."
1.0,five_obstructions,"Beautiful in its mastery of film and imagery, this documentary deserves to be seen as much as its long ago predecessor, ""The Perfect Human"". Inspiration to all of us against seemingly impossible odds, and altogether just an amazing film to watch."
1.0,five_obstructions,One of the best and most profound of von Trier's work.
1.0,five_obstructions,"Von Trier at the top of his game. Even better is this film, more than any of his other ones to my mind has a universal appeal, which von Trier doesn't necessarily seek or need, but I think is a positive nonetheless. Also, it's a nice respite from the emotionally ravaging films he makes."
1.0,five_obstructions,The gem is Von Trier's ending monologue.
1.0,five_obstructions,Deconstruction at its best. How do you take a perfect human and a perfect work and try to rethink it within various limitations/obstructions? Rollo May would be proud!
1.0,five_obstructions,Fascinating investigation of freedom and limitation. Also aesthetically transfixing.
1.0,five_obstructions,"A fascinating view into the creative process -- a meditation on ""following the rules"" (for fun, if not profit!)"
1.0,five_obstructions,must see for anybody involved with the creative process
1.0,five_obstructions,I love Lars Von Trier and his fantastic dickhead!!!
1.0,five_obstructions,"Did I mention that von Trier once referred to his children as ""little bundles of will and desire""? Goddam I love that."
1.0,five_obstructions,"Det Perfekte Menneske is my most favourite piece of film ever, and to continue the study through the five obstructions with von Trier is going beyond a filmic orgasm."
1.0,five_obstructions,Fascinating examination of the relationship between a filmmaker and his art.
1.0,five_obstructions,Fabulous study in art and cinema. It reminded me of my days in art school and the challenges of critiques.
1.0,five_obstructions,brilliant crash-course in film rhetoric 101.
1.0,five_obstructions,Lars von Trier is a creative mastermind.
1.0,five_obstructions,Delightfully sadistic.
1.0,five_obstructions,"except this is pretty damn good, too..."
1.0,five_obstructions,Amazing film about the failure of art to create honest human interaction.
1.0,five_obstructions,"A reminder that constraints, far from inhibiting the creative process, can in fact catalyze it. Asks some great questions about the morality of art (particularly film).The original ""Perfect Human,"" included as a bonus on the DVD, still seems fresh and relevant."
1.0,five_obstructions,Watching JÃ¸rgen Leth step up to von Trier's challenge is a dazzling and humbling experience.
1.0,five_obstructions,Who would have thought that flouting ones intelligence and superiority could be so entertaining?
1.0,five_obstructions,uzun zamandir seyrettigim en iyi film. muhtesem bir yonetmen

1.0,five_obstructions,A MUST for any filmmaker!!!
1.0,five_obstructions,Just annoyingly incredible!
1.0,five_obstructions,number five on my list?
1.0,five_obstructions,"Not for everyone. If you want to delve into the human psyche, this is an amazing journey. A voluntary subjugation of a brilliant filmmaker to an equally brilliant, if somewhat sadistic filmmaker."
1.0,five_obstructions,"A wonderful piece about film, directing, and the desparging gap between generations. This has some of the best cinematography as well."
1.0,five_obstructions,Possibly my fav von Trier/Dogma movie
0.0,five_obstructions,"two guys drinking, talking about remaking a short five times, and about how they hate animation... why did i see this in the first place? dont remember"
1.0,five_obstructions,"A must-see for film geeks. Lars Von Trier tortures his film directing hero, just to show that the old man still has it."
1.0,five_obstructions,One of the greatest films I've ever seen.
1.0,five_obstructions,My favorite movie ever.
1.0,five_obstructions,"Pure entertainment, with great interaction between maestro & former pupil. I could watch this a hundred times over and still come away smiling. Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant!"
1.0,five_obstructions,Bliss. An enjoyable gentleman's conflict with a thick patina of intellectualism smeared all over it.
1.0,five_obstructions,one of the best films about film-making ever made
1.0,five_obstructions,"TIENES que verla, sin palabras!"
1.0,five_obstructions,"this burns into the soulit has power that many will not understandand i find that sadit is a test aa test of a championit truly is remarkableit is a must, though, that you have an open mind in order to view this film"
1.0,five_obstructions,"Go see this. It will change your life, even more than the Shins."
1.0,five_obstructions,absolutely bloody genious.
1.0,five_obstructions,"I saw this movie in my film critic class, I´didnt know about the existance of Leth, However I did know slight about Von Trier, and I think its a very interesting challenge. Its not as simple as it may seem."
1.0,five_obstructions,Together with Dogville probably von Triers very best work.
1.0,five_obstructions,just see it.. and you will understand
1.0,five_obstructions,"Lars von Trier is kind of a butthead, but he can really make a good director sweat!"
1.0,five_obstructions,The best docu ever. PERIOD
1.0,five_obstructions,"ok, I hate lars von trier, as I equally hate anybody so unfairly talented, yeah yeah this movie is boring and pointless but for this very reason absolutely brilliant, it shows that you don't really need a plot (or a cast, or a soundtrack) to make excellent cinema. I hate you lars!"
0.0,five_obstructions,"I generally like Lars Von Trier, but this movie shows exactly how far he's got his head up his own ass. A real chore to watch."
1.0,five_obstructions,An extraordinarily clever cinematic experiment. Fascinating and entertaining throughout ...
1.0,five_obstructions,"Very original approach to film making, great idea for a project. Animated sequence is fantastic."
1.0,five_obstructions,Who am I to praise Trier and Leth?
1.0,five_obstructions,must watch material for any film student.
1.0,five_obstructions,"This movie is so surprising. Reading the synopsis, it sounds very boring and one to give a miss but in actuality it is a fantastic documentary with a very unexpected outcome. I really believe now that Lars von Trier is brilliant and planned it that way all along; he's an evil genius."
1.0,five_obstructions,"I loved this documentary which forces a director to remake one of his shorts in five different styles. Lars von Trier can be a real ass, but the five different films we get are really beautiful to watch."
1.0,five_obstructions,5 stars for 5 obstructions.
1.0,five_obstructions,"The best film about film and creator that I have ever seen. It's brilliant. It's a game film, a study of relation to self and film, exploration and exploitation of self and other. Give it a chance."
1.0,five_obstructions,Fantastisk film! Sett på BIFF første gang. Anbefales på det sterkeste!
1.0,five_obstructions,Lars Von Trier takes Leth for a ride! Film reminds me of poetry assignments.
1.0,five_obstructions,"Brilliant. If you don't think film is art, this isn't for you. And, you can go bugger yourself."
1.0,five_obstructions,What can I say... a masterpiece.
1.0,five_obstructions,"Amazing film, definatly gave an insight to the esthetics of film with Jorgen Leth to be exact. Amazing"
1.0,five_obstructions,"Unbound, an unforgetable journey"
1.0,five_obstructions,Reality TV for intellectuals for the big screen. Great!
1.0,only_human,it is so hilarious and funny .
1.0,only_human,I've watched this a few times & it's always funny. Pay attention in the beginning as the characters develop & it moves right along. Some great characers in a wacky family! Mom reminds me of a Spanish Andrea Martin.
1.0,only_human,One of the funniest movies I've ever seen!
1.0,only_human,Hilarious!What kind of genius can turn a Jewish girl bringing her Palestinian fiance home for dinner into a comedy?
1.0,only_human,funny funny movie :)
1.0,only_human,Hilarious! I laughed so hard.
1.0,only_human,Classic and hillarious screwball comedy. Spanish Jewish girl brings fiance home to meet the (very eccentric) family. Comedy and madness begins when they discover he is a Palestinian.
1.0,only_human,This film cracked me up. hilarious. Really good to see a comedy and lo0ve story centered on two cultures who are traditional enemies. Maybe love can conquer all. I like the bit with the frozen soup. classic.
0.0,only_human,I did not really like this movie.
1.0,only_human,All about a Palestinian and some Israelis

1.0,only_human,I loved this movie. I fine reflection on the human condition.
1.0,only_human,laugh out loud. the duck was the best part.
1.0,only_human,"This movie had me laughing so hard that I was in tears and my stomach was in pain. The strong and well developed characters are over the top but also very real. The humor is bizarre but funny, tucked in between the social and cultural issues."
1.0,only_human,"Bizarre, in a great way. It reminded me of 'Arrested Development.'"
1.0,only_human,"the same type of 'screwball comedy' for which almodovar is famous. although not an almodovar film, it's still funny and intriguing, although the resolution comes a bit too hastily."
1.0,only_human,I thought this movie was hilarious. Just when you think they reached the climax in hilarity it just keeps getting funnier.
1.0,only_human,"Cute movie about a weird family. The main story is that a jewish girl falls in love with an arab Muslim and takes him home to her family, and then you could guess how the rest will be..."
0.0,only_human,poor movie to say the least...

1.0,i_am_2011,This documentary changed my life.
0.0,i_am_2011,"Dumb, and obnoxious. Shadyac talks with a air of condescension, and everything he says or believes in is presented without any tangible evidence that the audience can understand."
1.0,i_am_2011,"Man, even Roger Ebert accuses this film of woo-woo, which indicates to me he didn't even watch it. Shameful. If you have an open mind, please give this a chance. It's inspiring, not very long, and a good use of your time, whether or not you agree with everything presented."

1.0,i_am_2011,"Wonderful film. Vital. Beautiful. If you cannot sense its truth, reexamine your life."
0.0,i_am_2011,"Good natured premise, but mostly just a mashup of interviews with new age authors set to stock footage of historical figures, events, and nature. No skeptical inquiry involved unfortunately."
1.0,i_am_2011,"Wow... what a great reminder that cooperation, and NOT competition is the Universal path to ""success"". GREAT movie, don't listen to the insecure nay-sayers, check this out AS SOON AS YOU CAN! You'll be happy you did."

1.0,i_am_2011,"Critics just don't get it. Obviously. He's criticizing the excess of the film community...and all consumers. Frankly, I think they expected Ace Ventura and didn't even bother to watch their screeners before rating it. Whether u agree or not...everyone needs to see this!"
