1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,Powerful and Heartbreaking
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,"HBO is free this weekend. A horror film of reality, Mea Maxima Culpa, should be seen by everyone. Kudos to Alex Gibney for giving 4 deaf men a voice and educating the public about 2000 years of cover-up."
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,"Un documental que todos los que nos enorgullecemos de ser ""Catolicos"" deberíamos ver. Una verdad demasiado fuerte."
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,One of the most amazing movies I've ever seen. Horribly sad but incredibly inspiring.
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,Santa Igreja Católica............
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,Amazing. Tragic. Brave. Compelling. Eye opening.
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,one of my favorite movie
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,This film expose the Catholic Church and the pedophile priests. Must see.
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,Chocada com os absurdos da Santa Igreja.
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,"A ÉSTO ME REFIERO CUANDO HABLO SOBRE LAS FUNCIONES DEL CINE. Muy buen documental, lo malo es que seguramente pasará desapercibido. SI TIENES OPORTUNIDAD, SERÍA UN PECADO PERDÉRTELO."
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,"A haunting look at a devastating set of scandals, and some of Gibney's best work."
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,"Shocking as hell, this documentary doesn't lack from anything and offers the audience a whole new spectacular experience by motivating most of it. Best 2013 documentary yet."
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,"A really disturbing story, beautifully told. Great documentary."
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,very interesting documentary
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,This is riveting. There is zero reason the Catholic church should be recognized as a state. Child molestation lead to the church's ultimate demise.
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,"Powerful and compelling, this is not a film to enjoy but one to be educated by, Gibney's film inspires an inherent sense of rage and shows that at the vein of everything, money, power and heinous people are always to be found. It is a film many will not watch but it's one we all should!"
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,Aihetta on käsitelty paljon mutta silti liian vähän!
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,"Stunning. Eschewing hyperbole, Gibney has allowed the subject matter to scream. In an age where the documentary maker aims to be as high-profile as the topic, this is refreshingly to the point. A gut-wrenching but compulsory piece of cinema."
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,"Shocking, shameful, and disgusting. The truth hurts."
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,A stunning documentary. Proof that the devil does exist . He's alive and well in the Vatican. Thankfully God exists too. He's alive and well in the people who have come forward in the face of true horror to share their stories. Truly terrifying.
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,The corruption and disgrace that is the catholic church is no surprise in this film but keeping the guys from the deaf school at the centre of the film makes it so affecting and highlights the corporate evil of the organisation in a very personal way. A huge and moving piece of work.
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,"A look at the horrific way in which sex crimes are hidden in and the guilty protected by the catholic church, and a simply excellent documentary."
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,Are we paying attention now! Something has to be done! Now! Stop hurting our children!
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,Great documentary. No religion is perfect and let's realize this. The fact that the Vatican is above the law is shocking.
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,A devastating doc to watch.
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,Great documentary of the sad truth. The sad truth of the many cases of molested children by priests. The film details the first known protest against clerical sex abuse in the United States by four deaf men. One of the many reasons why believe what I believe.
0.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,"A pretty crapy, highly biased, pseudo documentary that is a barely veiled political hit job on the catholic church. Obviously flawed and not really a well made film."
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,Must see film for anyone who ever thought they were Catholic and wonder why they are not any longer.
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,I feel like i need a shower after watching this
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,Heart breaking retelling and in depth analysis of the Roman Catholic church's fostering of pedophilia and how it continues to be a breeding ground for pedophiles
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,"Quer dizer que o papa só renunciou por problemas de saúde?! Conta outra, vai. Um documentário excelente sobre os casos de pedofilia e abuso na igreja católica e o descaso, e acobertamento, de seus membros sobre o tema."
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,"Un-real and Astounding, very sad and you can see the Church needs to do something. And oddly I wonder if the Pope stepped down recently, had anything to do with all this? ! If you watch the Documentary you will understand."
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,Astonishing and scandalous documentary
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,Unbelievable .....!!! :(( no wondering he quitted
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,"If you have HBO, you've got to see this. Especially now, with the news of the pope's resignation."
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,"It will break your heart and make you incredibly angry. People should be in jail, the money to the church should stop, and the immunity removed. Just a thought."
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,"Very Educational!I Want To Be The Shit Out Of Those Prist With MY Fist!Please Give ME 30 Minutes In A Boxing Ring With Brass Nuckles So I Punch Them In The Fuckn Face For Every Child They Molested!Do NOT Ever Give Money TO The Church!As W. Would Say ""These Are Evil Doer's"" Lets Invade Them!"
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,Shocking.The rot goes right to the top.
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,"Saw this at the Chicago Film Festival..it is great filmmaking, a sad but well told story. These deaf men were so brave."
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,Brilliant film. Hopefully we are seeing the tide has finally turned and the vatican and catholic church worldwide will no longer be able to deflect and resist fully admitting the systematic abuse and cover ups and realise these crimes must be treated as such.

1.0,love_is_strange_2014,Um lindo e maravilhoso presente de domingo!!! Amei cada minuto e cada personagem....
1.0,love_is_strange_2014,"Proves that a drama does not have to resort to hitting its audience with a brick just to get its point across. Marked by excellent writing and restraint, this is an elegant film that will not be difficult to watch again. Most recent example of drama without the melodrama."

1.0,love_is_strange_2014,"We saw an early showing of this and everybody involved is at the top of their game. These ""social injustices"" films are usually pretty dry but this is a must see. Both Molina and Lithgow have never been better. Of course it was ignored during awards season. Too gentle and sweet."
1.0,love_is_strange_2014,"Movies like these remind me of what life throws at us, and how we all truly deal. Great performances by these two great men!"
1.0,love_is_strange_2014,Absolutely terrific film
0.0,love_is_strange_2014,Although well acted there is no real plot. I was left cold by all the characters. I felt completely indifferent towards all the characters. I'm in my mid 50s and this is the first film ever that I considered walking out of after an hour.

0.0,love_is_strange_2014,"A very weak movie with almost no story. Secondary stories made no sense and were never developed. I really like Marisa Tomei and she did her best. The rest, including Lithgow, were beyond weak. Waste of time and money. Hard to believe the critic reviews."
1.0,love_is_strange_2014,"I was moved and in tears in some scenes. Heartbreaking, gentle and loving. Makes me long to have someone."

1.0,love_is_strange_2014,Beautiful. Beautiful. Beautiful.
0.0,love_is_strange_2014,An entirely amateurish affair. I didn't fall in love with a single character therefore I couldn't care about anyone's struggle or outcome.
0.0,love_is_strange_2014,Dreadful downer. Predictable story after first 15 minutes. Great actors wasted.
0.0,love_is_strange_2014,"These men needed a financial advisor long before they hit 70 years old! Sad, boring, slow scenes and deleted scenes so hard not to fall asleep."

1.0,murderball,By far the best documentary i have seen! It is raw and very revealing.
1.0,murderball,"Murderball isn't a great documentary because it deals with issues that make us a little squeamish, namely paralysis. It's a great movie that uses the physical limitations (and importantly lack thereof) as a great backdrop to a human story. It's probably the best sports movie I've ever seen as well."
1.0,murderball,By far the best documentary of 2005.

1.0,murderball,"A perfect sports documentary, a must see."
1.0,murderball,"Of of 2005's best documentaries, it's about quadriplegics who play in custom game-play intense-contact rugby. It's a very touching film, very informative, and gives you another view on many things (which my brother first said to me after watching it, we agreed)."
0.0,murderball,Murderball wasn't as good as I'd thought it'd be. Very disappointed.

1.0,10008507-deep_water,I read about the 1968 Sunday Times Golden Globe Race and Robin Knox-Johnston victory and Donald Crowhurst tragedy a long time ago.But not in so much detail as this documentary.I think it takes a lot of courage and it is also dangerous for a man to be left alone with his thoughts.
1.0,10008507-deep_water,"Deep Water is an absolutely stunning piece of work, and one of the greatest documentaries I've ever seen. A story about the human spirit, and the dark side of man's soul."

1.0,10008507-deep_water,Moving story of fragile humanity.

1.0,10008507-deep_water,"As a lifelong sailor I was deeply moved by this thrilling and emotional documentary about an around the world yacht race back in 1969.Even if you've never been sailing, you should see this film. It's very well done with historical footage from the actual race, diary entries, and current interviews."
1.0,10008507-deep_water,What a great story I had never heard of!!!!! Plus the family's issues to this day with their father! Ouch!!!!! Painful to imagine....

1.0,10008507-deep_water,"Quite possible the best documentary I have ever seen. This is hardly an adventure story. This is the story of one man making decisions that will impact a nation, a family, his reputation and ultimately, his life. Unbelievable film."
1.0,10008507-deep_water,Quien iba a pensar que una carrera de botes podia ser existencialista.Desde ya uno de mis documentales favoritos.
1.0,10008507-deep_water,"Wow! I will not be stingy with adjectives for this documentary. It is heartbreaking, suspenseful, moving, and redemptive. The story is as much about the actual journey as the decisions a man has to make when facing extreme circumstances. And how those decisions eventually come back to haunt you."
1.0,10008507-deep_water,"A great documentary. Pretty sad too. Well made and well worth watching, just amazing."
1.0,10008507-deep_water,Seriously - one of the best documentaries I've seen this year.

1.0,10008507-deep_water,"Great nautical documentary that is more about people than the race. Well made, nice mix of late 60s footage and contemporary interviews. Fun story, well told."
1.0,10008507-deep_water,A great look into a troubled mind that simply ran out of options coupled with the insanity that accompanies complete isolation
1.0,10008507-deep_water,"Nothing is diminuitive or insignificant...everything occurs on the grandest stage of human experience. As good as, if not a shade better than Touching the Void..."
1.0,10008507-deep_water,"A film about hubris, isolation and hardship. Although it gives some insight into the minds of the sailors and makes you wish that you understood more, its power lies in the way it leaves you with a sense that the vast majority of people cannot fully understand what happened and never will"
1.0,10008507-deep_water,"Despite being a fascinating and respectful documentary you could look at this as a profoundly disturbing film, a modern horror masterpiece where nothing whatsoever is shown but the imagination runs riot through the fears of the unknown."
1.0,10008507-deep_water,"ORSOME! A brilliant documentary, it's really interesting seeing the decisions that lead up to Crowhurst going mad ... I'm sure there's a lesson in there somewhere?!"

0.0,10008507-deep_water,Movie irritated me - as a sailor was disappointed - movie made of a liar and a cheat - I have no time for people like that. Sound was terrible - could have just been the movie house. Write up of the movie makes it sound like much more than it is - boring - fell asleep
1.0,10008507-deep_water,"One of the most interesting movies I've seen - but then I'm fascinated by sailing, biographies, non-fictional subject matter and solitude which were the themes around which this movie centres. Incredible original footage."

1.0,10008507-deep_water,"An intensely captivating, tragic peek at the self destructiveness of a man left alone with his ego."
1.0,10008507-deep_water,"One of the greatest stories I've ever heard, all the more amazing because it is true. That the filmmakers have been able to tell the story with power and skill is all the more amazing. Its up there with Grizzly Man as a courage, dreams, honour, madness, and the thin line that seperates them."

1.0,king_of_kong,"It's an insightful,funny and poignant descent into a eccentric,divisive subculture that turns out to be a hugely compelling and achingly human ode to the American dream and the people who chase it. It is also better than 99% of the crap that Hollywood puts out most of the time."
1.0,king_of_kong,More entertaining than you could ever imagine a documentary being. To the point where you start to wonder if it is all set up and everyone is an actor.
1.0,king_of_kong,"This movie is actually REALLY funny for a documentary, and is actually pretty fascinating. I was very impressed. Totally worth checking out if you love ""mockumentary"" style films, but the best part of this one is that it is a ""true"" documentary!"

1.0,king_of_kong,One of the funniest truly honest and best movies I have seen. It is like they made a video game Rocky with the two characters and people Billy Mitchel and Steve Webie. Also Brian Kuh is the biggest nerd of all time

1.0,king_of_kong,"had me asking myself ""what the actual fuck?"" many a time."
1.0,king_of_kong,The unlikeliest idea for a documentary (some adults try to break a record for Donkey Kong) turns out to be one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. To say I was riveted and hanging on the edge of my seat would be an understatement. Watch it!
1.0,king_of_kong,"Honestly, I happed upon this in the ""instantly watch"" section of Netflix. I LOVED it. Watch it, I'm serious. It's a regular ""rooting for the good guy""- type movie. Totally wasn't expecting to like it so much--"

1.0,king_of_kong,Not only a perfect documentary..but a perfect movie! WATCH THIS!
1.0,king_of_kong,"Riveting, hysterical, and surprisingly moving. All the elements of a classic good guy vs. bad guy three act drama fall into place so perfectly; it's almost out of Shakespeare. You will hate Billy Mitchell, who quite possibly is Satan incarnate."

1.0,king_of_kong,"Must see, even if you don't like video games."

1.0,king_of_kong,"Awesome! The closest thing to ""The Wizard's"" final battle scene that we can get in real life. I freaking love everything about it. Billy Mitchell can bite it."

1.0,king_of_kong,"A fantastic documentary with all the right angles: the sympathetic underdog, the little guy against a bigger (though not particularly big) and perhaps slightly corrupt organisation, suspicions of conspiracy, people with interesting obsessions and excitement in the moment. Don't miss this!"
1.0,king_of_kong,"Great Documentary, Sheds light on how much the supposed great 80's gamer Billy Mitchell is a cheat"

1.0,king_of_kong,"I've never seen a documentary with such a perfectly crafted story. This is a must see, for anyone, even if you don't like video games. It's truly inspiring, and makes a classic high score seem like a bigger accomplishment than anything you'll ever do."
1.0,king_of_kong,outstanding. i love documentaries and this is one that can be enjoyed by fans of any genre. classic tale of good vs. evil and the obstacles that the good guy must overcome in order to take down the champion. a great look into one of the many realms of nerdworld.

1.0,king_of_kong,it was Kool in a weird way
1.0,king_of_kong,"This is a brilliant doco! Just stummbled across it on Foxtel. You don't need to know a thing about video games to enjoy this story. It's a classic David & Goliath, Good vs Evil story & you couldn't make up characters like these!"
1.0,king_of_kong,"Holy crap, loved it! I love video games!!!"
1.0,king_of_kong,"One of the best documentaries I've ever seen, so enticing, real and intriguing. The story gets so deep and messed up OVER THE HIGH SCORE OF DONKEY KONG!!! You don't have to be an avid video gamer but if your into underdog and against the odd stories this is for you"
1.0,king_of_kong,I don't even like video games and I loved this movie. It was the classic tale of David versus Goliath. Everything about this film was enticing and addictive. Highly recommend.

1.0,king_of_kong,One of the most entertaining documentaries I've seen!
1.0,king_of_kong,"If you can shift your reality to believe that video games are the way of life and success, then ""King of Kong"" may be the most important movie ever made. If you can't, then it is just one of the most entertainingly weird cinematic experiences to ever be documented."
1.0,king_of_kong,"A movie-documentary that you don't need to play video games to enjoy. A lovable hero and love-to-hate villain go barrel-to-barrel for Donkey Kong supremacy. It bends the truth a bit at times in order to make a better story, but it's a great underdog story either way."
1.0,king_of_kong,"Possibly one of my favorite documentaries of all time. Even if it were a mockumentary, it would still be awesome, but that it's all real makes it even more fantastic."

Very entertaining and I found myself rooting for the underdog (as usual). Even if you're not a gamer, the story will grip you."
1.0,king_of_kong,"A true underdog story. You get caught in the characters, and is even more dramtic than some sports movies."
1.0,king_of_kong,Absolutely fucking brilliant. More mullets and virgins than a trailer park convent. The evil that lurks inside the gamer. Possibly the best film I've seen all year. Steve Wiebe you are my god!
1.0,king_of_kong,One of the greatest movie villains of all time can be found in Billy Mitchell.

1.0,blackfish_2013,"This is an eye opener, shame on Sea World and their practices. These magnificent creatures should be wild and free. This is a must see wake up call for all to see!"
1.0,blackfish_2013,"powerfully story, a must see"
1.0,blackfish_2013,There are only a couple of movies that have profoundly changed my view on issues. This is one of them.
1.0,blackfish_2013,An expose about SeaWorld and the captivity of orca whales. Very moving.
1.0,blackfish_2013,"PHENOMINAL!!!!!!!! The best movie I have seen in entire life by far! So inspriational, yet haunting but definitely the best film yet!"
1.0,blackfish_2013,Great thought provoking movie. Make sure you see it.
1.0,blackfish_2013,I'm not supporting Seaworld or any other type of place again that supports the capture of wild animals. It's absolutely disturbing and disgusting to what was done to them.
1.0,blackfish_2013,I was shocked and sad when I saw this movie:(
1.0,blackfish_2013,"Amazing movie, anyone who hasn't seen this and has been to sea world/marine land at least one point of their life, needs to watch this."
1.0,blackfish_2013,Heartbreaking. I never really went to Seaworld anyway (especially since The Cove) but I absolutely will not support this evil empire in the future.
1.0,blackfish_2013,Wow! This information has really been kept from the public. I will never go to SeaWorld again. Very sad.

1.0,blackfish_2013,"Compelling, bittersweet documentary. Makes me wanna pass on ever going to Sea World again.."
1.0,blackfish_2013,Watched this last night. Very good doco. These animals should be out in the wild ocean. It is definitely not the whales fault or the trainers it is Seaworld that is at blame here. Let them out and be free.
1.0,blackfish_2013,Such an amazing film and so informative. I learned so much about killer whales an what these trainers had to go through as well as the animals. It's a bittersweet experience for the viewers.
1.0,blackfish_2013,"A tremendous film about for-profit-suffering that challenges and nuances our relationship to these majestic, emotionally-superior non-human animals."
1.0,blackfish_2013,"This is an excellent, eye-opening film about using whales for entertainment."
1.0,blackfish_2013,"One sided, but, what it does show makes a person never want to take in a show at a Sea World type of park again. Watch the movie and then research Sea World's response to the movie and then make your own decisions."
1.0,blackfish_2013,I have seen this documentary 3 times and Sea World and other similar places of entertainment are off my radar for good.
1.0,blackfish_2013,"SeaWorld are a disgrace!!they don't care about the orcas ,just money"

1.0,blackfish_2013,"If you are someone who loves nature, this movie is a must-see. It is shocking and disturbing, but something that I wish I had seen years ago. It is a well made film with a message that is vital to our existence on the planet. Very emotional, very moving, and very educational."
1.0,blackfish_2013,This Doc will make you question ever going to a Sea World park ever again.
1.0,blackfish_2013,Very disturbing documentary on why animal captivity is just plain wrong especially for Orcas who's lives are cut in half when they are in captivity. Free them
1.0,blackfish_2013,"If you love killer whales or animal planet, this movie is for you. Full of interesting TRUE facts that'll change your perspective of Sea World. These are amazing mammals and this was a fantastic documentary."
1.0,blackfish_2013,Pretty intense makes you rethink the SeaWorld franchise and what they stand for.
1.0,blackfish_2013,One of the best documentaries I've ever seen and one of the best movies I've seen this year.

1.0,blackfish_2013,No la he terminado de ver pero esta super interesante
1.0,blackfish_2013,"Heartbreaking. To see such majesty, crushed. It's soulbreaking when you see some of natures most beautiful creatures, enslaved to mans ideals."
1.0,blackfish_2013,"After watching this I couldn't support going to Seaworld...... So sad, a must watch..... Free on Netflix...."
1.0,blackfish_2013,I cannot believe how the innocence of Seaworld in my mind has been stripped from me in the last hour. I will never look at them the same and will never go another aqurium that houses orcas ever again
1.0,blackfish_2013,A eye opening documentry!

1.0,good_hair,Best movie I've seen this year. Period.
1.0,restrepo,Absolutely phenomenal. My words here will not do justice to the movie itself. Go see it.
1.0,restrepo,You need to watch this film.
1.0,restrepo,A truly unique experience. The film literally takes you into the trenches and into the minds of soldiers. The way war changes a man is disturbing to say the least. Scenes where soldiers laugh and cheer at tearing an enemy to shreds is justifiable but still disturbing and thought provoking.
1.0,restrepo,5 stars is all i can say!!!!!!! MUST SEE
1.0,restrepo,Amazing well documented insights inside a group of heroes in honor of Doc. Restrepo as well as the American soldiers fighting for their lives in the middle of Afghanistan's Koregnal Valley. Maybe the most satisfying of all the military documentary in years.
1.0,restrepo,An insightful and fresh look at the War in Afghanistan and its effect on our troops. Deep and worth the watch.
1.0,restrepo,Far and away the best war documentary ever made.
1.0,restrepo,"A harrowing, heartbreaking and important film. It wisely avoids political discussions about the war in Afghanistan, and instead focuses squarely on the brave young men who put it all on the line. I'm in awe of these men, as well as those whose stories aren't documented on film."
1.0,restrepo,"The realest war film I've seen. A great story and coverage of the deadliest post in the U.S. military, the Korengal Valley of Afghanistan."
1.0,restrepo,The Greatest Documentary of all-time.
1.0,restrepo,caught this on nat geo last night...
1.0,restrepo,"5 Stars, excellent documentary. Thank all the soldiers who fight for out country and freedom everyday. I couldn't imagine doing what they do."
1.0,restrepo,This documentary gets straight into it. The movie takes place in the insanely dangerous Korengal Valley. It's more of a follow-a-long for their 15-month deployment than trying to create any sort of linear narrative.
1.0,restrepo,great film got to see.
1.0,restrepo,"One of the best, if not the best, war documentary I have ever seen. Highly recommended!"
1.0,restrepo,Best movie I've ever seen in school
1.0,restrepo,"A must watch for the ""entitlement"" generation. Also, since Roger Moore feels the doc was lacking excitement, he should be immediately drafted and deployed to the front lines. Maybe he'll find some excitement there."
1.0,restrepo,I've watched plenty of documentaries on the war in Afghanistan and this one was surely the best.you really feel for these guys and this is a totally awesome documentary
1.0,restrepo,"There have been countless cinematic war movies in the past, but ""Restrepo"", though a documentary, contains elements that none have been able to achieve: Brutal and honest reality that reaches out to an audience that can fully relate."
1.0,restrepo,"Some films mark history for ever. This is one of them. It's moving, disturbing and definitly scary. But isn't what war really is ?"
1.0,restrepo,This was an awesome documentary. Shows you what our troops go thru. God Bless the USA.
1.0,restrepo,This is just one of those films that every American should watch. Afterwards you will have a much greater appreciation for how truly brave our soldiers are.
1.0,restrepo,An amazing documentary!

1.0,restrepo,Completely amazing and candid look at the war in Afghanistan. One of the best documentaries I've seen in a long time.Very raw and eye opening
1.0,restrepo,"Excellent documentary: the most ""real"" movie about real soldiers. Reminds me of ""84 Charlie MOPIC,"" but better - Restrepo's real."
1.0,restrepo,"Beautiful documentary, but not for the lighthearted."
1.0,restrepo,best. If not the saddest movie I've seen all year.
1.0,restrepo,still one of the greatest war movies/documentaries I have seen
1.0,restrepo,By far the greatest movie ever. Our Troops are jerks plain and simple.
1.0,restrepo,Gives you a real taste of war. It doesn't glorify war like every other movie does.
1.0,restrepo,Definitely a must see for all Americans!!!

1.0,restrepo,One of the best movies I have ever seen.
1.0,restrepo,A wonderful and terrifying look into the real war our soldiers fight. No romanticism here.
1.0,restrepo,Great movie. Good Documentary
1.0,restrepo,"Gripping. It's hard to even think of this as a ""movie"". It strikes me that, during the Vietnam War, this type of coverage was on the nightly news. No wonder there aren't comparable protests now: because we don't SEE it."
1.0,restrepo,you should see it...
1.0,restrepo,"Amazing, gut wrenching, heart breaking, must see before you ultimately decide if we should be there."
1.0,restrepo,Amazing film ! Portrays what the lads go through out there to a T ! Amazing !
1.0,restrepo,"This documentary is amazing. R.I.P 'Doc' Restrepo, Vimoto, and Schruger."

1.0,restrepo,...very very well done ... should have taken that Oscar!
1.0,restrepo,A must see doc. for anyone no matter their opinion of the decade long war.
1.0,restrepo,You just need to watch this
1.0,restrepo,The tension of The Hurt Locker only for real.
1.0,restrepo,Might be the single best military documentary of all time. This story is one you have to see to really understand the magnitude of war on Americans and others around them.
1.0,restrepo,Wow. This shows you the incredible hardship our soldiers face out in Afghanistan that we often never truly see. This film/documentary really immerses you in the harsh conditions our soldiers endure on a daily basis. Every American should watch this whether or not you support the war.
1.0,restrepo,"Wow. Amazing. Very intense, very honest look at what it's like ""over there"". The interviews with the involved soldiers really give you insight into the hearts and minds of these soldiers. No political bias, no spin, simply a great straight forward documentary."
1.0,restrepo,Every American must watch this film.
1.0,restrepo,"Yea, it's a documentary, but don't shy away from it 'cause you think it may be boring or verbose. Before you choose to watch another war movie, watch this first. It's a real account of what happens and delves into the emotional aspect of war's effects from the perspective of real lives."
1.0,restrepo,Excellent year long documentary with a Marine platoon in the Korengal Valley in Afghanistan. It's amazing what these volunteer heroes go through for us!!! WARNING: LAUNGUAGE IS VERY ROUGH
1.0,restrepo,"I've seen many movies and shows about war and have been been deeply affected by many scenes in them - but to see this documentary and to watch the raw, pure emotion in their eyes is both heartbreaking (one scene in particular) and uplifting."
1.0,restrepo,The best film I have seen to date depicting the trauma of war. It isn't bias. It just shows you what's actually happening out there. Highly recommended.
1.0,restrepo,"Life in the ""deadliest place on earth"". The director was killed last month in Lybia and of course Bin Laden, the man who arguably started this war, is now dead. Kinda makes this even more relevant. If you're an american you should see it."
1.0,restrepo,Great documentary...just see it.
1.0,restrepo,Excellent.Rollercoaster ride of emotion.
1.0,restrepo,"Embedded with the Second Platoon this documentary follows the brave men who, for 15 months, served in the most dangerous part of Afghanstan. A gripping and powerful documentary that gives just a glimpse of what these brave men went through and how it changed them."
1.0,restrepo,Amazing what these men do for us! Respect!!
1.0,restrepo,"This movie shows the soldier side of war, not the left or the right side"
1.0,restrepo,"This is the most powerful piece of film making ive seen in awhile.Powerful,gripping ,dramatic..life n death stuff.want to know whats going on in Afghanistan?this movie is not the feel good movie of the summer"

1.0,restrepo,Everyone should watch this.
1.0,restrepo,"A film with no real pretense, other than to simply put you straight into the middle of the action and show you what really happens. To my admitted ignorance about combat, I have to confess it all feels terrifyingly real."
1.0,restrepo,"Just finished watching Restrepo. For those who are not familiar with the term ""1000 Yard Stare"" this movie gives an abundance of real life examples of how and why it occurs. A very different and exceptional documentary."
1.0,restrepo,Crude live war documentary....outstanding...
1.0,restrepo,Makes you support our troops but question the necessity for war at the same time. Very moving.

1.0,restrepo,A doc about the Afghan war using on the ground footage and soldiers own words
1.0,restrepo,"this is pure documentary filmmaking, depicting war without bias and giving soldiers the respectful portrayal they deserve .. forgetting the usual cinematic trickery most would employ to enhance the dramatics, 'restrepo' captures the essence of war .."
1.0,restrepo,"Awesome documentary about an Army platoon stuck in the most dangerous place in the world at the time, the Korengal Valley in Afghanistan for 15 long months."

1.0,restrepo,"If this doesn't win Best Documentary Feature, then there's no point in even having the category. Not as graphic as it could have been, but it's still really heavy. As far as I know, those are real bullets being fired at real people. Not recommended for the squeamish."

1.0,restrepo,This documentary takes a look at the lives of soldiers engaged in the deadliest places in Afghanistan. It doesn't get much realer than this. This is the type of story that needs to be told.
1.0,restrepo,Great look at the Afghan war. Everyone needs to watch this.
1.0,restrepo,"I'm usually not a huge documentary fan but this may be one of the best movies I've ever seen. It steers clear of the ""right or wrong"" arguement and is completely apolitical. It's just a look at what the young men of our country are doing while we're living our lives. Watch it."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,This is just phenomenal. There is a reason it is considered a classic. One of my favorite films to this very day. 10/10
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Immediately iconic, Boris Karloff is amazing, Frankenstein is the greatest of the Universal Monsters."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Despite being in someways radically different from the book, Frankenstein the movie, is still able to hold it's own against the critically acclaimed novel, whilst both complimenting and changing the source material to it's particular needs and specifications."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,I give this a 92/A-.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Boris Karloff will always be the best movie monster of all time, and has set the stage for many inspirations to come in the decades! A cinematic masterpiece from beginning to end!"
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Frankenstein is stylized, dark, and a highly influential piece of cinema. It does stray much from Shelley's original vision, but it also creates an unforgettable story full of haunting images."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Colin Clive's mad performance and the legendary Boris Karloff dominate this classic. It's a shame that Clive died so young. His nuanced performance, alongside the moody but innocent Karloff, make this a genre standout that is imitated even today."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Still a FANTASTIC Film! While maybe not the scariest film I've seen (back then it was!), but the film is well-acted, has a good story showing the monster is not really bad but just misunderstood, good pacing and is just a classic!"
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Karloff's performance really gave this iconic monster true character. An instant classic! Mary Shelly would be proud!

1.0,1007818-frankenstein,First ultimate monster movie!
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"A true oldie, but a goodie. Karloff is masterful as Frankenstein's monster, and Clive swings back and forth between manic wannabe god, to tortured, remorseful soul. A must for anyone who loves their creature features."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"5/5 * One of those rare old horror films that still scares people today, presenting one of the most memorable monsters in a brilliant dark atmosphere"
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"hold up really well. Haunting, scary, and great back drops"
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"An iconic classic of horror by director 'James Whale'. The collaborative design of Whale, Jack Pierce and Robert Florey gives this film it's gothic style and it's iconic recognisability and makes it perhaps the most famous horror film ever made."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"""It's a live"", The story is about a scientist assembles a living being from corpse parts in which his experiment goes bad when the being escapes. This movie is a cult classic gold, the movie goes really dark and really out of control in a good way."

1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Thats something remarkable
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Boris Karloff's scary performance as the monster is now the stuff of legend, but the film itself, skillfully examining the thin boundary between brilliance and insanity, is surely as unsettling today as it was in 1931."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Boris Karloff is perfect to play as the Frankenstein. The movie is such a classic science fiction.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"One of the greatest monster films ever. This and ""Bride"" just may be the Universal Monster series' best."

1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"A great movie that shows the dangers of science. The makeup on Boris Karloff is great, and Boris Karloff is permanetly scary once you see him for the first time. But instead of scaring us to death for the whole movie, the movie that haves some great funny moments."

1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"It's got to be one of the darkest films ever made during the 1930's, even now I'd consider it to be pretty morbid. It definitely lives up to the hype the main three monster movies. I would hold it as one of the greatest science fiction movies ever made"
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,truley an amazing film!

1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"just a great film. For 1931 what Whale created was just epic. Obviously very influenced by German Expressionists, especially in his use of shadowing, lighting and set design. He also effectively used sound to further the horror. And Karloff was awesome."

1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"""That's Frank-en-steen"" (from ""Young Frankenstein""). I really loved this classic based on Mary Shelley's book. It's not frightening at all; more warm then anything else. A winner!"
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,The film's merrit is earned in Whale's direction and Karloff's brilliant performance rather than total purity to Shelley's novel. Truly a film classic worth watching again for the sake of pure cinematic elements. One of the best horror movies ever made.

1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Great performances all around make this an endearing horror classic. A great reflection of how humankind can be more monstrous than any ""monster"" that can be created by man. Karloff is amazing at garnering sympathy even with his brutish visage."

1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"It's as classic now as it ever was, despite having very little shock value anymore, and a few rather silly scenes."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Frankenstein scared me to death when I was a kid. Boris Karloff is fabulous as the frightening, but misunderstood monster."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,One of the all-time great horror flicks. I can't get enough Karloff.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Iconic horror film, dated but still impressive."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,A disturbing bet yet eye opening film of what happens when man himself decides to become the creator instead of letting nature take it's normal route.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Classic meditation on: beauty,death,size discrimination,the origins of crime,childbirth and many other deep themes in this awesome movie."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Classic! Boris Karloff was awesome as the Monster.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Deviating from the novel, which is my favorite of the Victorian era, the fact that it was concocted by a group of simple Hollywood marketers is quite apparent. I new it would be campy, but I think that aspect made it funner to watch."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"One of my favorite movies. Brilliantly made. Even better perhaps, than the often touted Bride of Frankenstein."

1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"I love this Movie to death! I like it just as much as the Wolf Man, my favorite! It has a great storyline, and by the end, you feel sympathy for the Monster. I think Boris Karloff is the best Frankenstein so far! ;)"
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Frankenstein is my favorite classic horror series. Boris Karloff is the perfect actor to play the monster. In the end I really end up feeling bad for him b/c he tries so hard to fit in nobody accepts him.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Boris Karloff rules.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,I'd fuck this movie. Seriously.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Frankenstein is the best monster on the face of the entire earth, and Boris Karloff is the best Frankenstein on the face of the earth."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"The classic Universal version of Frankenstein. Despite taking a few liberties with the source material (including changing Dr. Frankenstein's first name), the film remains a classic after 77 years and its not hard to see why."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,not only one of the best horror movies ever...but one of the best movies ever.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Saw it when I was 5 years old. First horror movie I ever saw. I've been in love with it ever since.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,I always think about Bela Legosi in 'Ed Wood' calling Boris Karloff a cocksucker. But this is still a classic.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"The finest horror film ever made. James Whale is a great director. And Karloff, what an amazing, talented actor. He is responsible for the worlds greatest horror icon."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"IMO, it's still the greatest! It's so iconic and has impacted every good horror director. The monster is loose!"
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Greatest and most influencial movie ever made!
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,James Whale's masterful adaptation of Shelley's tale of family tragedy and science gone wrong. Not quite DRACULA but one of Universal's horror lynchpins.

1.0,1007818-frankenstein,A horror film classic!!!! This is my favorite Universal Monster.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Boris Karloff is amazing in this film as the not-so-gentle giant. An all-time classic.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"A materpiece. From Boris Karloff's brilliant pantomime to Colin Clive's manic jadeness this is a classic. The production design, from the expressionist motifs to the legendary laboratory are iconic."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,A classic for a reason.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Karloff is once again amazing and doesn't utter a complete sentence in the film. Wonder what it would have been like if Lugosi had not turned down the roll of the Monster?????
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Still stands the test of time
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Hollywood has made some really, really great films: Casablanca, this...I'm sure there are others."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Universal did no wrong in the '30s and '40s when it came to monster movies.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Karloff in his most memorable role. Great!
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,This is the very best of the Universal Monsters era...the golden age of horror ghouls. I love Frank!
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"OK, this had NOTHING to do with the book, but broke new ground, regardless."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Dear lord!! There is something about this movie that gets me. Older horror movies, with the grainy dark black and white cinematography, always have that particular creepy thing going for them and this is the one that REALLY took it home. It still is creepy today IMO."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,I am a big fan of the classics and this is one of my faves.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,possibly the greatest horror movie of all time. karloff was the mannn.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"A perfect horror film, even if it's dated. Man playing God is never good. Clive is just about the worst parent in film history, and Karloff's performance is probably as great as any I've seen."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,the original frankenstein film rules
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"An absolute wonder! It may not be all that faithful to Mary Shelly's gothic tome, but it's iconic nonetheless. Karloff is extraordinary, you'll feast on the cinematic wizardry on display."

1.0,devil_came_on_horseback,"Haunting, disturbing, infuriating. Why hasn't our government done anything about this genocide? After the haulocast we promised ""Never Again"" and yet we've let it happen for 5 years. It's immoral and disgusting when politics is more important than a human life."
1.0,devil_came_on_horseback,"heartbreaking. one of the best documentaries i've ever seen though. compels you to want to help, even though there is no evident resolution to stopping the genocide.

1.0,devil_came_on_horseback,Powerful and moving documentary of the ongoing genocide in Darfur. A definite must see.
1.0,devil_came_on_horseback,"The very fact that 3/4 of Flixter isn't interested in this movie, is why Darfur continues, but for me if you trace the lack of resolution portrayed in this film to it's source, you might just find the source of all human suffering."
1.0,devil_came_on_horseback,"This is a must see movie/documentary for all of us as it's eye opening beyond belief. The genocide documented by Brian Seidle is examplary. I found this one at my local library. Though very difficult to watch, it shows the evil in the world."

0.0,eraserhead,"Don't believe the hype this movie is not scary, interesting or even entertaining, it's just plain boring and none of the movie even makes any sense, so avoid this piece of shit at all costs!!!"
1.0,eraserhead,"Hasn't aged a day, gripping and mind-bending, a masterpiece"
1.0,eraserhead,A surreal movie a la Buñuel and one of the best films of David Lynch.
1.0,eraserhead,Dream consciousness trip of pure originality! Not the most easily accessible film to understand where Lynch is coming from but for the more broad minded of film lovers there is no better introduction to Lynch's extraordinary mind than this.
1.0,eraserhead,The one that started it all. Very ahead of its time. Definitely the most surreal movie Lynch has ever done.
0.0,eraserhead,"Complete garbage. When it comes to desperately trying to look weird or interesting, David Lynch consistently displays more shame than any teenager I've ever seen walking into a Hot Topic. This is a highly acclaimed film because critics and cinema-philes rarely have testicles."
1.0,eraserhead,stuff got very surreal in the muv. next time you''ll be shagging a chick keep on mind that your kids can born with the semblant of a cthulhu spawn
1.0,eraserhead,It's great to look back at the different ways one can mindfuck themselves
1.0,eraserhead,"Whether it's my love for the surreal or this film's actual merits, I can't say. But I really loved this strange little gem."
1.0,eraserhead,A surreal masterpiece and one of the most disturbing films ever made.
1.0,eraserhead,Eraserhead is David Lynch's first film and is one of his best works. Eraserhead is weird and is surreal picture and feels like you are dreaming. Eraserhead is one of my all time favorite films and is a must see.
0.0,eraserhead,What an awful film. Unwatchable.
1.0,eraserhead,"A beautifully haunting debut from the extraordinary David Lynch. The film may cause a sense of confusion, however the reason why people should watch this film is not to understand the plot,but in fact to appreciate the beauty of it."
0.0,eraserhead,"This is one of the most disgusting, sickening and meaningless films I've ever seen! Avoid eating anything while watching it!"
1.0,eraserhead,"Metaphorical, strange, and appropriately bleak considering the subject matter, Eraserhead stands out as not just any midnight movie, but THE quintessential midnight movie"
1.0,eraserhead,"A bizarre, surreal, and morbidly strange post-industrial experimental film of great importance. There is nothing else quite like it, and it is unforgettable. Not a date or feel-good movie, in case you were wondering. No cinephile can claim erudition without seeing this film."
0.0,eraserhead,"This is truly the worst movie I have ever seen. Weird, creepy and unbearable, it is just not my cup of tea. I saw things I could never unsee."
1.0,eraserhead,best Surreal Films ever
1.0,eraserhead,"It still feels unique, frightening, and unforgettable on repeated viewings. There's an argument to be made that this is Lynch at his most pure . . . no straightforward narrative just mood, imagery, and dream logic."
1.0,eraserhead,This movie is so surreal and bizarre. I can see the many Lynchian things that are in his later movies.
1.0,eraserhead,"Remember that time you got so sick you weren't even sure you were real any more? David Lynch had a video camera, and you didn't know it at the time, but he was filming the stuff you dreamed as you slid in and out of consciousness."
0.0,eraserhead,"Quite literally one of the most horrible excuses for a film ever made. A sick world, I never want to enter, or look at, again. David Lynch is a perverse human being who probably shouldn't be allowed in society."
0.0,eraserhead,"After hearing this was such a cult classic, I invested two hours of my life to watch this crazy crap. I kept looking for the symbolism or theme, and just watched a director/writer/producers bad acid trip. Would appreciate any feedback from anyone who 'got it'."
0.0,eraserhead,"1/2 Star. I have never rated a movie lower than 2 Stars until now, Congrats Eraserhead"
1.0,eraserhead,"Subconsciousness filmed. In later films Lynch (director) is also very interested in subconsciousness, but I think this one is his un-matched break-through."
1.0,eraserhead,"It creates chills and leaves an impact on you that makes you wonder what you just watched.Even if you don't understand it, you are still left feeling unknown presence of dubiety.One of the three of David Lynch's best films."
1.0,eraserhead,"Eraserhead creates a world unlike any other. Because very little is clearly explained, it invites viewers to fill in the blanks with their own ideas and feelings. It's a lot of fun to form your own interpretation of this weird movie."
1.0,eraserhead,An amazing surrealistic nightmare
0.0,eraserhead,A pointless waste of time that's too surreal even for me and fails to be engaging by not actually having a coherent plot or indeed a coherent anything else.
1.0,eraserhead,Fave movie ever!!! See it now!!!
0.0,eraserhead,"good director, just a dork."
0.0,eraserhead,One of the most overrated movies of all time. David Lynch equates being bizarre with being artistic. They are not synonymous.

0.0,eraserhead,"Horrible movie, I felt dumber after I watched it, it was confusing and had random nonsense on top of horrible acting, worst movie I've ever seen"
1.0,eraserhead,This movie is disturbingly freaky. The mutant child might as well be the original E.T.This sure is one psychedelic drug trip. Its completely twisted if you like that sort of thing.
1.0,eraserhead,"This movie takes you somewhere you'd never thought possible. After watching this movie, your perception of reality will be out of whack."
1.0,eraserhead,"This is not a film to watch at 12 am. Nevertheless, great movie with disturbing and creepy atmosphere, mostly thanks to the visuals, sound and great vision of David Lynch."
0.0,eraserhead,"A masterpiece? In this film, everything is not fine for I only witness disgusting creatures and a creepy farce."
0.0,eraserhead,"Guess I'm not a Lynch fan. Seems like all of his movies can be watched by skipping ahead 15 secs watching 1 second then repeat, without missing much of anything; if anything was ever really there, aside from evidence of a weird and somewhat sick writer/director."
0.0,eraserhead,I wish I could rate this lower.
0.0,eraserhead,"This gross interpretation of life, is so bad and sickly. Though of an artistic nature, its pretty annoying and disgusting. The disturbing aspect of the film is on how David Lynch is able to come up with such a film. 5 years to make this film? I'm surprised as hell. Poor depiction of the modern life."

1.0,eraserhead,"Eraserhead is probably the creepiest film I have ever seen. It's sense of relentless, constant dread and disturbing imagery is simply incredible. It will stay with you long after the film has ended. In heaven, everything is fine."
1.0,eraserhead,eraserhead is a very unique movie that personally didn't make much sense to me and with its creepy score and outrageous visuals Lynch creates an extremely bizarre and disturbing movie but still worth a watch or two
0.0,eraserhead,Unwatchable piece of crap.
1.0,eraserhead,Enjoyed this movie a lot. Searched for it for years before I was able to rent it.

0.0,eraserhead,"If you like films that are more like abstract art, where meaning is applied by the viewer and not the creator, then you might like this. I am not one of those people, and this film is even too strange for me."

1.0,eraserhead,"A grotesque and deeply disturbing film that is radically and unrelentingly strange. Cryptic, haunting, and darkly spectacular."
1.0,eraserhead,"It's been years since I was that creeped out. The bizarre environment, the unearthly visions of Henry and the horrifying crying of the mutant child makes this film one of the creepiest so far."

1.0,eraserhead,"Obra maestra del surrealismo cinematografico, comparable con los clasicos Buñuelianos y (a mi parecer) superior a los sumamente pretenciosos clasicos Jodorowskianos. Obscura, asfixiante, claustrofobica, bizarra, genial."

1.0,eraserhead,Easily one of the best cult films ever made. The lighting and sound are perfect examples of why Lynch has always been a man able to create an all encompassing atmosphere. You will never forget this film.
0.0,eraserhead,Artsy dream filled drivel. I found it to be a waste of my time.
1.0,eraserhead,"Disturbing,Unsettling."
0.0,eraserhead,"it was weird, disgusting, not scary, not funny....super slow and sooo damn boring :( meh."
1.0,eraserhead,This is the closet film depiction of dream logic I have ever seen. Bare in mind it was written by David Lynch as he was a new father. Every mans nightmare about fatherhood is given flesh in this film. NOTE: DO NOT WATCH WHILE ON HALLUCINOGENS
1.0,eraserhead,"i don't even know what to say about this film other than it should be viewed as a work of art, and not really a ""movie"""
0.0,eraserhead,Incredibly weird movie.
1.0,eraserhead,"wasn't easy to get a copy in poland old days...thanks to friends i have unique copy with Korean subtitles, luv u Asia and Josh - the best birthday gift ever!"
0.0,eraserhead,come on. weird cause it can be isn't smart by default.
1.0,war_tapes,"Very good documentary. Very entertaining, very eye-opening, very thrilling, and maddening at times. It's very good to finally see what it was like to be a soldier during the Iraq war"
0.0,war_tapes,"I don't recommend this one. It's a difficult watch, and not very enlightening whatsoever."
1.0,war_tapes,You get attached and unattached quickly. Defending supply routes is part of war. Germans were forced to defend 7-thousand mile long supply routes while in Russia...imagine the details? This documentary is not shown by the future victors.
1.0,war_tapes,This is one of the best of the Iraq war docs to come out. it really brings the war home through the cameras of the soldiers. It also follows the soldiers as they return home and try to readjust to their lives as veterans. this is a great doc and a film every american needs to experience. High marks!
1.0,war_tapes,"An amazing film, shows what is really going on over in Iraq with out an agenda."
1.0,war_tapes,can't get much more real than that. Oh and if thats war Sign Me Up!
1.0,war_tapes,SEND THIS FUCKIN' FILM TO GEORGE BUSH AND EVERY AMERICAN IN THIS DAMN COUNTRY. WE SHOULD BE PLAYING THIS 24/7 TO EVERYONE! THIS IS THE REALITY OF OUR IGNORANT PRESIDENT! DOWN WITH BUSH BITCHES!!!
1.0,war_tapes,A great documentary and very true to life. I suggest it to anyone to watch and understand what U.S. soldiers deal with in Iraq. I thank these soldiers for taking the time to document their time in Iraq and sharring it with us.
1.0,war_tapes,"This is a gripping, although less than memorable, documentary. It's unfortunate so few younger people would take the time to watch it."
1.0,war_tapes,"Possibly the most compelling work made on the Iraq War, it defies any partisan criticism. It's neither an indictment of the war or an affirmation of it, even as its subjects openly express their thoughts and frustrations. Instead it offers a thorough portrait marked by striking ambiguity."
1.0,war_tapes,Humanizes the war in Iraq providing a refreshing antidote to the canned/tired abstract coverage of the war. Would highly recommend.
1.0,war_tapes,"this is an incredibly well put together documentary. not just for the amazing scenes, but for the soldiers' testimonies themselves which offer a wide range of political opinions. In the end, you get the idea: we need to end our current policies in Iraq."
1.0,war_tapes,"The soldiers' perspective on the Iraq War and the complicated repercussions for them and their families. Extremely graphic at points, but war is violent."
1.0,war_tapes,National Guard soldiers in Iraq with cameras... intense!
1.0,war_tapes,one of the best documentaries ive seen
1.0,war_tapes,"AMAZING, if you are or were a soldier, watch this film"
1.0,war_tapes,"Extremely well cut doco. The soldiers behind the camera are very articulate and make this work. Humourous, tragic and engaging. So far one of my fave docos of the year."
1.0,war_tapes,"I'm officially adding this to my list of ""Movies everyone should be forced to see"" list"
1.0,war_tapes,"The war in Iraq... AKA the war for cheese, is definitely all about money and oil and not for the security of the world. Its a great doco, must see!"
1.0,war_tapes,"I saw a screening of this in Burlington, VT. Excellent Q&A; with the executive producer after the showing. Watch it, and make your own judgements.Stop the madness...."
1.0,war_tapes,"My husband and his squad are in this movie about Iraq, he is on the front cover climbing the flag pole. I'm so proud of them."
1.0,war_tapes,this movie is an amazing account of the truth.
1.0,war_tapes,"This is the single best peice of coverage on the Iraq war that has ever been put out. And it is relatively unbiased because there is no voice over narration, just tapes made by the soldiers themselves."
1.0,war_tapes,Amazing Documentary! One of best I have ever seen.
1.0,war_tapes,A great documentary about a what soldiers face in Iraq from the perspective of the soldiers themselves.
1.0,war_tapes,I bought the DVD the first day it was out. These guys are true heroes. They've been through and seen shit that normal civilians can't even dream of. Out of my 300 or so DVD?s this is in my top 3. Best iraq documentary as of yet. Truly remarkable work.
1.0,war_tapes,"Damn, good must a see!"
1.0,war_tapes,"really tragic and disturbing, but very revealing and honest"
1.0,war_tapes,So far it's the best doc I've seen on the war

1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,Who would've known 2 unknown english blokes in 05 could make a zombie film better than most of the subgenre's directors with a touch of dark comedy and payin homage to the great G.A.Romero at the same time. Saw this in the theater. Its 1 of my classics!

1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,"Hilarious and scary at the same time, this is a successful horror-comedy that mostly leans towards the comedy and nonchalance of the protagonists. The best comedy I've seen in years."

1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,"Reinvented the sub genre (horror comedy) much in the way Scream reinvented slasher horror. Fresh, irreverent, and beyond any boundaries. Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright could write my funeral eulogy and I'd rest in true peace."
1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,Fucking love this masterpiece.

1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,Best zombie comedy ever
1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,"The best Zombie films ever (Personal opinion). It is a masterpiece action-horror zombie flicks. Funny, witty, great script and great directing. This film is perfect. What else do you want. Zombies, violence, blood, cool casts and funny."

1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,"Romance, peleas de pareja, un amigo idiota, zombies, gente despedazada, ¿que más puedo pedir?"
1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,"One of the best comedies of the last decade and one of the best zombie films ever made. While definitely a British comedy this one can easily be enjoyed by anyone. It mocks and plays with zombie film tropes and takes no prisoners, and the magic of its satire never fails."
1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,"That one segment from 'Spaced' where Tim fends off zombies while playing Resident Evil 2 is now a whole movie. And it's just as funny. Shaun of the Dead is intelligent, bloody, the cast are all great and it's funny as hell. How's that for a slice of fried gold?"
1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,I have nothing wrong with this.
1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,it a best comedy-horror ever !!!!!!!
1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,"Simon Pegg and Nick Frost go together perfectly. Shaun of the Dead does something most horror comedies do wrong, which is to offer good scares but retain the comedic flow of the movie."
1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,possibly the best zombie movie
1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,Shaun of the Dead hits the ultimate sweet spot in a perfect blend of horror and comedy the film is structured in probably the best way and with its fantastic characters from fantastic actors not only make Shaun of the Dead the best zombie movie ever it may be the best comedy ever too
1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,One of my favorites. The perfect cult movie. very quotable and very funny. It's also the deepest of the 3 Pegg-Frost-Wright films thematically and emotionally.
1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,"Exciting, Engaging, Bittersweet, this is a stroke of brilliance from Simon Pegg and the excellent Edgar Wright."
1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,Really good movie very funny
1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,"Absolutely loved this flick.It's a bloody good time and a brilliant zombie movie.Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and writer/director Edgar Wright make an amazing team.Amazing comedic zombie flick."
1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,Probably my favorite move of all time.
1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,It balances horror and humour brilliantly which combined makes it one of the best zombie movies with movies like zombieland
0.0,shaun_of_the_dead,This film is neither funny or interesting. I thought Pegg and Frost did a great job in Hot Fuzz but this was very predictable and lazy. It was like they were not even trying. Such a great cast with Martin Freeman involved but sadly brought nothing to this film.
1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,The best mixture of comedy and horror. Ever.
1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,"Cheesy horror, lots of comedy, original zombies, instant classic!!! Its a perfect zombie comedy!!!"
1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,"Shaun of the Dead manages to mix a witty, satirical, funny script with graphic violence. No one really knows how, but it works, and Wright's new take on a cliched genre is refreshingly exuberant."
1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,The best film of the 00s.
1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,Watched it a million times and it never gets old. The humor is quite intelligent but the gore is there too to please the diehard zombie fans. I recommend everyone watch it atleast once.

1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,Arguably one of the best films made this side of the century. A hysterical script along with quality performances from the entire cast.

1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,"One of the smartest horror movies I've ever seen (along with Scream and Cabin in the Woods). This film knows the zombie genre inside and out, and pokes fun at it perfectly. Pegg and Frost make for the greatest comedy duo of the 21st century."
1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,"While at the beginning you think it's going to be a funny Shaun Pegg movie about metophorical zombies instead of eat your brain zombies, this movie delivered in the laughs, scares and even the drama and action which is all better the second time."

1.0,cutie_and_the_boxer,"A great documentary, sad and happy story of an artistic couple and their 40 year marriage. Very touchingly told and presented. What I got from it is we all have to make our own bit of happiness in this otherwise bleak life and we can be no one but ourselves."

1.0,cutie_and_the_boxer,A beautiful documentary. It even managed to melt my cold black heart. The highlight of this years Canberra International Film Festival
1.0,cutie_and_the_boxer,Transcends its subject matter beautifully
1.0,cutie_and_the_boxer,This movie is awesome!
1.0,cutie_and_the_boxer,"Deeply moving, inspiring, and surprising. What it appears to be at first, is actually just an appearance. The underlying truth took half a lifetime to mature and rises to the surface. But when it does, it's beautiful!"

1.0,crumb,"Extraordinary, thoughtful and haunting, Crumb is a bizarre and disturbingly illuminating examination of the infamous comic book artist Robert Crumb and his family."
1.0,crumb,"The quintessential opposite of a feel good movie, thus making it utter perfection."
1.0,crumb,EPIC FILM IS EPIC. Robert Crumb Ã (C) uma das pessoas mais incriveis de todos os tempos haha
1.0,crumb,Remains one of the most compelling docs about an artist's life ever made. I love it.
1.0,crumb,robert crumb es la persona mas normal del mundo. solo que es honesto.
1.0,crumb,One of my favorite movies!
1.0,crumb,Damn creepy ass white boys. Talented though.

1.0,crumb,A great doc that shows you the life of one of comics most eccentric artist.
1.0,crumb,"One of the greatest documentaries ever made, with revelatory scenes on the life and family of the underground artist, and a real-life conclusion as satisfying as any Hollywood manufactured happy ending (and it's definitely well-earned)."
1.0,crumb,I think i have a crush
1.0,crumb,"There's not enough insight about his art, but the portrayal of Crumb and his family impressed me to the point of giving this documentary 5 stars."
1.0,crumb,I was impressed the first time I viewed this but upon re watching it I was blown away. This is undoubtably one of the greatest documentaries ever made about art and people. It has such an enormous depth that I missed the first time. Highly entertaining and very enjoyable.
1.0,crumb,Een van de beste documentaires ooit.
1.0,crumb,my favorite documentary? maybe?
1.0,crumb,brilliant and very odd
1.0,crumb,"so fascinating. if this movie had been nine more hours, i would've watched the entire thing."
1.0,crumb,"Uncannily mirroring Crumb's artwork, this doc is haunting, funny, disturbing, compelling, shocking, and incredible. An amazing portrait of a comics legend."
0.0,crumb,I was really excited to watch this and really wanted to like it. But alas. Waste of time.
1.0,crumb,I'm amazed how I didn't know R. Crumb before this doc. such a genius.
1.0,crumb,One of those awful docs that really makes you sick to your stomach after its over. Really good though.
1.0,crumb,"An interesting person, an even more interesting family."
1.0,crumb,One of the best documentaries I've seen.
1.0,crumb,Extraordinary documentary. Highly recommended.
1.0,crumb,"Would it be weird if I said that this is one of the most inspiring movies I've ever seen? I mean, I know it's twisted and perverse, but still...you have to admire the guy for living the life he has, considering the way he grew up."
1.0,crumb,This just may be one of the best documentaries to make the connection between creativity and craziness.
1.0,crumb,"A documentary following the influential underground artist Robert Crumb along with his troubled family, friends and lovers. Crumb is a man you can't take your eyes off of. He's just so fascinating to listen to and observe in his everyday life."
1.0,crumb,"My favourite documentary. Brilliant and a scream. Zwigoff's work, with Crumb as subject, has Joycean touches."
1.0,crumb,"Fascinating and brutally honest portrait of the troubled, twisted and brilliant cartoonist R. Crumb, famous for his underground, decrepit 60s cartoons."
1.0,crumb,A bold and unflinching examination of an (socially edgy) artist and his equally talented but more troubled male siblings. Deserved its Grandy Jury Prize at Sundance
1.0,crumb,"If you're interested in Crumb, or if you're not, it doesn't matter, because either way this a fascinating and disturbing example of both the biopic and the documentary at their best."
1.0,crumb,Unbelievable. Intense and hilarious
1.0,crumb,One of the great documentaries. Just as much a study of the trials and rewards of being an artist as a personal study of Crumb and his sometimes disturbing family.
1.0,crumb,"One of the best documentaries I've ever seen and one of the best films of the 90s, watching this one never gets old."
1.0,crumb,underrated / underseen documentary

1.0,crumb,A fascinating look at a disturbed genius with odd parallels to myself.
1.0,crumb,"A documentary that is both light-hearted and very dark. Meet the disfunctional family of underground cartoonist, R. Crumb."
1.0,crumb,"Tough to watch. It's not funny, but is a very good look at dysfunction."
1.0,crumb,"This is my favorite documentary ever. You don't have to know anything or want to know anything about Crumb to find this illuminating. This is the most tragic, f****d family ever in a movie, fiction or documentary. Crumb was saved by his art. Pretty uplifting film in the end."
1.0,crumb,probably my favourite movie of all time...demonstrates the line between genious and insanity
1.0,crumb,one of the best documentaries I've seen in recent memory
1.0,crumb,remarkable portrait of a broken genius
1.0,crumb,"One of the more fascinating movies I've seen in years, but beware: very disturbing (not family viewing)."
1.0,crumb,Perhaps the most affecting documentary I've ever seen.
1.0,crumb,This documentary.. you have to see it. Crumb: creator of comics and really strange and humorous guy.
1.0,crumb,"Very enjoyable biopic, though I found myself more intrigued by Charles and Maxon than Robert."
1.0,crumb,"It wasn't the misogyny, depression, abuse, or strange sexual perversion that startled me - it was how cheerful Robert Crumb was about it. Now I'm even more convinced you need more than just talent to create great art - you need a twisted life-view too."
1.0,crumb,This is a fairly depressing and disturbing look into the life of Robert Crumb and his brothers.
1.0,crumb,"Wow, not documentary like this one his brothers are mind-altering. You'll never see the world the same after this one."

1.0,crumb,"My favorite documentary of all time, a look into the sexually irreverent comic artist Robert Crumb. As you watch the film you learn that it's not Crumb that the movie is about but about how tame he is if you learn about his family, a shocking group of misfits (that's putting it lightly)."
1.0,crumb,this is one of my favorite documentaries of all time. it's hypnotic and sad and witty all in one.
1.0,crumb,"Fantastic biopic/documentary hybrid on perhaps the greatest artist of the 20th Century. If you've never heard of Robert Crumb, you're missing out. His life story is just as compelling, hilarious, and poignant as his work."
1.0,crumb,A powerful testiment to the salvation of art. Crumb is a genuis but even more compelling is the realization of just where he might of ended up if he couldn't exorcise his demons on the page. Amazing.
1.0,crumb,"Watched this in Intro to Psychology to understand abnormal psychology. To be brief this is about a family of three brothers where one's sexual object is his pen, the other's object is little boys, the other likes to molest woman. This movie brings you into their world."

1.0,sicko,Piss me off. I'm moving to France. Let's go Jason.

1.0,sicko,my favourite part is when they visit cuba <3
1.0,sicko,"Made me want to move to France. And I don't care if it's ""biased"" because I have spent many a year without health insurance, and it blows. So biased or not, he's exactly right."

1.0,sicko,"Oh My Goodness...!!!... I loved this film. I had a major life or death surgery, done in Germany, and this clearly states the truth! We need FULL health-care in the USA. If only the people in the USA knew... Come on, it's the US for Us. We should take care of US."

1.0,sicko,"This film may be propaganda, but it does present facts to support it's reasoning. But more than that, it uses actual people who have been victims of Health Care bullshit to hit it's ideas home. Touching, funny, and heartbreaking. Classic Michael Moore."
1.0,sicko,Well worth watching.
1.0,sicko,every american should watch this if they want too see what they are really missing

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,A true Horror classic. Make a point to see it. Very scary.

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Stunning! Boris Karloff returns to his role and this time he's at his best. everything about this film is memorable from Mary Shelley at the beginning to the bride of the monster at the end.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the few sequels that i loved more than the original.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Awesome in every way!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,The very best of the Universal Horror films.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"A wonderful, cinematic feat as beautiful in its visual presentation as it is in its touching tale of the human condition as represented by Dr. Frankenstein's repulsive monster, who has become more 'human' than in the first installment."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"With spectacular visuals, a great villain, and the monster being able to talk, Bride of Frankenstein is undeniably superior to the original."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Just one word CLASSIC
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the few sequels to really surpass the first film on all levels. James Whale's use of tracking shots and self parody are really ahead of its time which makes this film feel timeless in a sense.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,My third favorite film of all time. Everything about this movie is fantastic.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"This is the perfect example of a great film. The symbolism, Art Direction, acting, directing, and score is nothing short of pure perfection. This sequel is better than the original film. We really get to know the Monster better than ever."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,one of my favorite 'sequels' ever same director same cast and oh those silver streaks in elsa lanchester's hair.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"It's great! Although, it's more about Frankenstein than his bride; and it ends rather strangely."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Although not a horror film, this movie is one of the best films from the 30s. Holds up EXCEPTIONALLY well."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,seen it & own it! =0)
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"This movie is amazing. It combines comedy, parody, horror, and drama together in the right combination. The era when the movie came out helps a lot too. Multiple/mix genre like this wouldn't fly today."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Shows how man is the true monster.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,It really IS as good as they say.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,A sequel that surpasses the original. Boris Karloff was a woefully underrated actor. He gave the Frankenstein Monster such a gravitas thatno other actor who has essayed the role has ever come close to matching.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"A definite great movie. The only problem is that you only see The Bride for 2 minutes, then the movie ends... What?"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Alone: Bad. Friend: Good!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,For me better than the first.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"I LOVE the opening. What a way to allow for a sequel when the first seemed over and done with. A little more of a comedy, a little more of a horror, lots more energy and style than the first film. And what an ending! ""WE BELONG DEAD!"""
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,The absolute best film of its era and genre.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Probably the first sequel to be clearly better than the first.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"My favorite classic horror movie by far. Enough has been said about this movie over the years that I can't add anything more. If you haven't seen this, and you love classic cinema, this is a must see."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"I was no older than 10 when I saw this, and I had such a crush on Elsa Lanchester (I know, you don't have to say it)."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,your wife hates you get drunk with a blind guy!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,The monster smokes dope
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Its incredible how well James Whale's horror classic has aged. The greatest Frankenstein movie made is technically astonishing even to this day and Boris Karloff is both frightening and emotionally touching as Frankenstein's monster. Perhaps the greatest universal horror movies ever made.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,The best horror film ever made! Astonishing performances by Karloff and Clive! The reviving of the bride is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror films.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"This is a great sequel! I love that it, to me, has some comedic lines. Or maybe its just my brain because I LOVE Young Frankenstein? :)))"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,This movie does the impossible multiple times. It makes the monster into an endearing character. The movie makes you feel for the murdering mix of dead bodies. And most of all: it expands and exceeds the original. One of Universal's best!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,This was strangely magical and creepy with a heart hidden within itself.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"awsome, just awsomne!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"A true classic. Even better than the original. Ernst Thesiger practically steals the show with his flamboyant and macabre Dr. Pretorius. A must see, if not own, for any true horror fan."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Perfect! She's alive,she's alive...."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Alone, bad... Friend, good..."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the best Frankenstein movies ever.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"A Fantastic film. The Monster is more present in this film and is very enjoyable to watch. Boris will always be the best Frankenstein as far as I'm concerned. Elsa Lanchester is very Haunting and beautiful as the bride, yet her hissing is very eerie. If you love Horror movies this is a must see."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"I actually really liked it. The special effects were extremely impressive for 1936, Boris Karloff did an amazing job as The Monster, supporting actors and other roles were great actors,and the scene with the blind man for some reason really touched me. The whole friend idea I guess. I reccommend."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Really is one of the greatest movies of all time. Deserves to be among the ranks of Citizen Kane or Sunset Boulevard.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,nem folytatÃ¡s. ez a befejezÃ (C)s!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"""The Monster Demands a Mate"" Exceptional! Bravo! , Greatest of all Frankenstein film. It's rare for a film to have a sequel which is way better than the original one or had the same level of appreciation!. One of my favorites of all time!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One Of The Worlds Greatest Horror/Thriller Movies!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"fantastic film - possibly better than original, shows more brutality than the original and more character development. A superb masterpiece of early cinema"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Another one of those rare sequels that outshine their predecessors. Also directed by James Whale 'The Bride of Frankenstein' manages to delve deeper into the characters from the original film. Again Karloff gives his all as the Creature who longs for acceptance.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"About as brilliant as a sequel can get. Great story, interesting characters, beautiful music, and the performances by the actors are amazing. Bride of Frankenstein is a true cinematic Masterpiece."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"This is definately my favorite of the sereis. Clive and Karloff bothe give great preformances and makes you feel for the characters, even the monster. dr. Pretoreous is one of the best villains on screen and possibley the best mad doctor portrayed in a motion picture. check it out cause its epic."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"The best of the Universal monster movies. Bride is that rare sequel that, after viewing, feels like an essential companion to the original, the other half to complete the story. It's also truer to the book (a little), and just incredibly satisfying all around."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"The Bride of Frankenstein is just as great as the original, but this time around, we feel for the monster."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Personal favorite. I love this movie. ""To a new world of gods and monsters!"""
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"No doubt about this...one of the greatest masterpieces ever seen. If you haven't seen it yet, do whatever it takes to get a copy !!!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,I love this film so much!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Clive and Karloff continue to own their respective roles. This time Elsa Lanchester is along for the ride and adds something special. I'd actually argue that this is superior to the original Frankenstein.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"As classic as Whale's Frankenstien is, his sequel is even better. A true masterpiece and one of the crown jewels in the Universal classic monster series!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"just like its predecessor, classic"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Iâ(TM)d have to say all of the Universal Frankensteins held to a marvelously entertaining standard. Yes. Even âFrankenstein Meets Wolfman.â?  The humor James Whale injected into this one was quite a risk, but it came of beautifully, only increasing our sympathies for The Monster."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Yes. This is how you make a movie. Fantastic characters all around and insanely good lines.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Despite the fact that people will inevitably compare and contrast this with the original 1931 Frankstein, this is a different, pardon the pun, beast. Bride of Frankenstein is characterised by the camp and hammy performances of Ernst Thesiger and Una O'Connor and a sly, dark sense of humour."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Absolutely the best Frankenstein movie ever.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the very few sequels which improves on the first film. This is a blackly comic horror.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"This was the last of the great Universal horror films...after this, Universal took a downward trend into cheap camp, and the bright spots for the next 20 years were few and far in-between."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"More emotionally powerful than it has any right to be, ""Bride"" forever destroys the idea that a sequel is always inferior. Great emotion, iconic imagery, and even visual effects, are what make this widely considered one of the greatest thrillers ever put to film."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Director James Whale once again creates another great Frankenstein movie. As a sequel, the movie sticks a little more truthfully to the book and manages to give the monster a voice. A strange and at times funny film."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the best horror films ever made. A classic of the 1930s.

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,The rare sequel that outdoes the first film.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Lanchester was awesome and this movie was just great as well. This one was actually better than the first one which is saying something
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"It takes everything that works in the first Frankenstein and improves it. The shots are more iconic, the score is outstanding, the Monster learns to speak and the film mixes creepiness, pathos and still-impressive special effects into one incredible film. A visual masterpiece, regardless of genre."
0.0,bride_of_frankenstein,While i do love the old monster movies this is just not a good one. It was way too stupid. 16%
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"An absolute classic of a horror film. Karloff is fantastic, as are Dwight Frye and Ernest Thesiger. A shame The Bride isn't in it that much. Who knows what it would've been like then?"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,a highly entertaining film. a sequel which is better than the original. it had a bigger budget and it is obvious. sets are huge. there are more storylines. everything is much more complex. it is even funny at times. plus its tense and exciting. and beautifully filmed. classic.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Great sequel! It has all the elements that made Tim Burton, Tim Burton! Emo kids, Jack fans, all that gothic art direction, that surreal world and those dark and twisty were here first! Brilliant!"

0.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Another oldie crapfest.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Atmospheric, campy and just plain fun to watch. I love the whole 7 film Frankenstein series released by Universal in the 30's and 40's but this one is my favortite. This, the second in the series, was the last one directed by James Whale."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Some say this is better than the first one, it's definitely a close one. More science fiction is thrown in with the black magic dr. and his miniature people, it's kinda weird but that's the only part I have a problem with, everything else is great!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"One of the great horror films, is also a biting satire of love and acceptance. Lonely guy wants to meet a nice girl, he gets two doctors to create her and she rejects him. But that's how it goes in life. The ugly guy will always be rejected by the girl for the good looking doctor."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"The best Frankenstein movie and one of the true Hollywood classics! It's also the rare sequel that is as good as, if not better than, the original!"

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"The greatest sequal ever made. Far surpassing the original in it's scope, story, and ending. I love every frame of this film. A desire to have someone else so bad that you will do anything to get her, and realizing that it was not meant to be."

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Now this is a horror movie. Classic in every sense.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"One of my all-time favorite films, horror or otherwise.

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"I guess you could say this film is the Godfather Pt. 2 of horror. Its one of the very few horror sequels that manages to be better than the original. Don't get me wrong James Whale's Frankenstein is an absolute classic, but this one is better."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Oh please, if this isn't one of the greatest horror movies ever!"

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Dr. Pretorius is so much scarier than Karloff in this. We feel so much more sympathy for the monster in this one and there are some very clever special effects. The best Frankenstein film I've seen.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,This is a good movie
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"One of the first extremely subversive horror films. A true Masterpiece. James Whale is a genius, he made one of maybe two films that showcased the brilliance of Mary Shelly's book."

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"De toda una saga, de toda una epoca, la joya maxima de los estudios Universal."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"to the untrained eye this film simply reaffirms social norms and values, but it is subtly coded with subversive critiques of race, gender, and sexuality. i'm not saying the hollywood censorship codes were a good thing, but they certainly forced filmmakers to become much more clever."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"A very fun time. Some honestly wonderful special effects, too."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"An absolute classic! Really. To have created this film in 1931 is astounding. It's short and sharp, just like all those good, old films, and it's truly poignant at times. A must-see for lovers of b-grade horror and the like ;->"

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Better than the first in my opinion. Sad as hell.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the few occassions that a sequel is better than the original. I also like how Whale took elements from Shelley's original work and inocrporated it into this film.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,vanskelig og tro at denne klassikeren er over 70 Ã¥r gammel!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"La mejor de todas las peliculas de Frankenstein. Y una increible Elsa Lanchester, con un look adelantado en 60 años. Y el gran Boris Karloff, y la gran Una O´Connor..."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"James Whale topped himself (no pun intended) with this film. The shadowplay, especially in the laboratory, is awe-inspiring. I love the dialogue, the acting (especially Ernest Thesiger's amazing performance as Dr Pretorius)"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Even superior to the original. The greatest sequel ever made and of the greatest horror films. This film has a bit of everything: horror, drama, action, comedy. A must-watch movie."

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"This movie is possibly the begining of my love affair with drag queens, don't ask me why. This is the greatest monster camp ever!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Maybe I'm biased...but...just so fucking great.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Way different than Frankenstein, almost a comedy but a very sad classic."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Still stands up today. A wonderful old monster movie in which people are the real monsters. A sly black comedy as well and ahead of it' time.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Cool follow up to a fantastic film.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,This is where it's at.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Sequel surpasses original; there are only two other instances of this (as the previous reviewer notes). Everything in this movie is exactly where and how it should be. I love me some Dr. Pretorious.

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,This film is like a dream. Karloff as well.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Karloff and Lanchester are made for each other, (literally), in this 1935 classic."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"A great classic, not really spooky as funny, though"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Few films so deftly mix stark horror and bizarre comedy. It's also one of the best movie sequels of all time. Watching The Bride of Frankenstein every year on Halloween night is a tradition with me.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"This film is a prime example of a sequel that surpases the original. Loe all Universal horror, but this is by far the best!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Taking the first film to a whole new level.

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"The best film from Universal's classic horror cycle, and far superior to the original. James Whale outdid himself."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Stunningly modern mix of humour and tragedy. Endlessly re-watchable from the arch prologue to the weird conclusion. James Whale knew a thing or two.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"The first sequel to truly top its orignal. Beautifully shot, haunting score and very funny, this is the best of the classic Universal Horror movies."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Creepy and atmospheric, this movie is fantastically entertaining."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"The greatest sequal ever. One of the greatest example of theater transcribed to film. Boris Karloff is amazing... He is why I did theater , all because of this film"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Absolutely gorgeous film. I think I enjoyed this one more than Frankenstein - more emotional by far.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"This flick walks the line, man. You're gettin chills one minute(if you let it, it is creepy), and laughing the next."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Much better than its predecessor. The movie has a more personal touch and is more stylized. Overall, it's a much better experience than the first Frankenstein."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Very odd. But at the same time very good. Universal never had a flop with horror films in the 30's.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Classic Universal Horror. This one is the best of the three Karloff films, which is saying a lot. There'e a bit of whimsey here, but it's dark, brooding and fun. The Bride is devastating and the monster SPEAKS!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"""Bride of Frankenstein"" was a terrific improvement over its predecessor. It added character, conflict, and a great score, and Whale made one of the best sequels in history."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,This movie is surprisingly fantastic.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,This is a rare case where the sequel is better than the original. Best in the series.

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,James Whale at his best!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"James Whale hit cinematic gold with his sequel to Universal's smash hit Frankenstein. From Karloff's sympathetic portrail of the monster to the grandios sets, Bride improves on the original in every way."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"One of the best sequels ever made, no matter what movie series you consider."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"I saw one scene: the final one. I take its memory out and fondle it every half moon. Knocked me on my ass. Beautiful. Walesevolved expressionism into the horror genre. I am a pedant, a monster far worse than Boris Karloff any day."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Although not a horror film, this movie is one of the best films from the 30s. Holds up EXCEPTIONALLY well."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,This is the best horror movie of all time.

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,The Best Universal Horror picture made
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"One sequel that blows the first out of the water. Even though the first one is wonderful, Bride of Frankenstein is just a better film. It goes by faster, it's more entertaining, it's touching. Haha"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the best movies ever made.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the few sequels ever to surpass it's original in everyway!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Arguably better than the original Frankenstein, The Mummy and Dracula, James Whale's second Frankenstein picture is a masterpiece of gothic horror. As re-animated babes go, Elsa Lanchester's ""Bride"" is hot as blazes. Too bad she didn't feel the same about Karloff's ""Monster"". A perfect film."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Tops the original in every way and may be the best damn horror film of all time. There's just so much entertainment value here, it's incredible."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,A brilliant sequel that doesn't take itself too seriously. Tim Burton owes a lot to this movie.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"The greatest of all of the Frankenstein films, and the greatest of all the Universal Monsters Collection! James Whale ?s direction is superb and is far ahead of any other film around that time, and Boris Karloff gives the performance of his life. Masterpiece!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Better than the first.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"One of, if not, THE best horror movie ever. One of the first to use humor in the story as well, if only they had kept the additional poltlines in, but this is where the monster really shines"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Just one of these movies you´ll see over and over again, laughing every time"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Nothing like seeing Elsa Lanchester in full dress as the bride!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Better than the original Frankenstein (which is hard to top) ""Bride of Frankenstein"" is... chances are, the best film to come out of the Universal Monster Era (alongside the original)"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Great, but I'm sure young people will hate it."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"The greatest sequel, better than the original Frankenstein, even better than the book."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Probably the best of the classic Universal Horror films.

1.0,food_inc,A very illuminating documentary. One interesting fact is 1 beef patty in a burger can contain the meat of up to 1000 cows!! Yum! Think I'll be buying grass fed beef and free range chooks from now on.... You should watch this to see what your really eating.

1.0,food_inc,"Finally watched this, and now I feel very overwhelmed. It also made me think about how greed brings nothing good into the world, yet it consumes so many people. Frustrated, yet inspired. Love that there are farmers out there like Joel Salatin."
1.0,food_inc,"Smart, gripping, and life-changing (for me, anyways). After you see what Perdue is doing to chickens, what IBP is doing to cattle, what Smithfield is doing to pigs, what farmers are doing to us, and what Monsanto is doing to farmers, you may never want to eat meat again."

1.0,food_inc,A must-see for anyone who plans to eat food in the near future. Another reminder of how low humanity will stoop when greed and profit are their only motivation. Watch it and take action!
1.0,food_inc,"Shocking documentary about the ""Hidden Kitchen"" where our daily food is cooked.I'll keep inquirying about this issue since in my area there must be at least a bunch of healthy places where I can get my food from."

1.0,food_inc,It really is an important must-see documentary for everyone. I don't find it overreacted and showing the rough scenes makes this documentary into a REAL documentary. It revealed secrets and historical stories of the agriculture in America made me open my eyes.

1.0,food_inc,"Excellent documentary.

1.0,1013970-miracle_on_34th_street,Great Christmas classic. It's no surprise that Edmund Gwenn received an Oscar for his excellent portrayal of Kris Kringle/Santa Claus. And I didn't even know that the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade existed in the 40's!

1.0,1013970-miracle_on_34th_street,This timeless Christmas classic is good on any occasion. Edmund Gwenn completely sells his Oscar-winning performance as Kris Kringle (aka Santa Claus?). The cast and script are uniformly excellent. This is one of the most uplifting films of all time.

1.0,1013970-miracle_on_34th_street,"The greatest feature of Santa Clause ever told, doesn't much address that Christmas is about Christ, but plays to the budding commerical whims of Macys, (the idea of a fat Santa Clause), and the beginning of modern postwar commercialism. Made America feel good again at the time."

1.0,jodorowskys_dune,It is a great documentary and I wish they had made the movie. Jodorowsky did gather a fantastic team.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"After Reading Herbert's Dune I had to watch Jodorowsky's Dune and wow.. Most crazy thing to learn was that I 'saw' most of the artwork it inspired already, through the reading of the Metabarons & the Incal. What a great & inspiring man. i hope one day they'll make this movie, in some form."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Ain't it amusing that the documentary on Jodorowsky's potential DUNE was far better than the actual DUNE we got from a ball-clamped Lynch?
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,See great creative leader in action & where many iconic Sci-Fi came from.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Dune could have been awesome with this documentary showing on how this would have been a pioneer to all Science Fiction films! Truly incredible
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,This is a such a well-crafted and inspiring doc that I found profoundly heartbreaking and awe-inspiring. Watch it with your cinephile friends or even a date- you're gonna end up at an all-night diner drinking coffee and talking about it.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Fantastic, so disappointed this movie was never made."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,TRULY brilliant and inspiring.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Incredible and amazing! Anyone interested and loves films should watch this. A must-see. Dune must be made Jodorowsky's way.
0.0,jodorowskys_dune,I WATCH EVERYTHING! Kind of a historical conversation but very fabricated. The guy was claiming genius. It took an army to create Dune!
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,One of the best docs. I've seen in a while. The saddest part about this movie is that it made me think of Jodorowsky's age and that someday he'll die and I'll have to live the rest of my life without another one of his films.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,This may be one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. The stories of assembling of his team right down to the designs are so engaging and interesting. His Dune was really something special that never happened and actually this movie makes you admire him more as a film maker after watching it.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Oh what might have been! MÃ¶bius, Giger, Salvador DalÃ­, and Chris Foss. It would have been transformational. Instead we got that piece of excrement from David Fucking Lynch, the worst director in Hollywood history."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"I really felt for him, the joy and pain of creating. I love the Dune that is, and am intrigued by the Dune that could have been. I wonder what it would have inspired in me at 11, had I seen it instead."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Amazing! a great story about a passionate filmmaker.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Maybe we've not been prepared to see that picture yet. The story goes on.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Amazing documentary about the never completed movie project of one of the masters of surrealism and metaphysics-fiction. Jodoroswky far from being a master and a legend is an advanced soul never accepted or understood in the prostituted mainstream scene.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,An amazing glimpse into the unproduced vision of Alejandro Jodorowsky.
0.0,jodorowskys_dune,We just rented this documentary based on the high rating. It was extremely disapointing. We love documentaries however definately not this one. Boring interviews with boring people talking about how profound this movie making project is to them. Nothing happens so dont waste your time!
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Wish someone would make jodoroskys version of Dune.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,me and my dad love it
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Fun look at the would-have-been making of Dune. Though, I would much much much rather have seen the actual movie!"
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Some day this Masterpiece will be reality.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"how come he didn't hire a spiritial warrior accountant to keep the cost down? still, pretty damn inspiring"
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Najlepsie scifi ktore nikdy nebolo natocene
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,It was interesting to see how Jodorowsky envisioned a film version of Dune. I had read about how there was a fun being planned in Brian Herbert's biography of his father and this film shows the process and how close Jodorowsky was to completing the film and how it would have looked.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Must watch for sci-fi fans.Would have been an amazing film!
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Film as it is is definitely not a masterpiece, but to see this crazy person and his visions come alive is probably most inspiring piece of film I have seen"
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"I burst out in tears when I saw this, absolutely amazing documentary."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Wow. Would have been the best science fiction film ever! Learned so much about how ahead of his time Jodorowsky was and how everyone copied his work afterwards. Excellent documentary.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,brother in arms. forever dope.

1.0,jodorowskys_dune,My favourite ever documentary. An absolutely spellbinding look into the creative genius and passion behind Jodorowsky's Dune. A truly remarkable and inspiring film.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Don't think it can be made as it would have been back then with that crazy bunch but i'd still wanna watch it if it does
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,La película perfecta es la que jamás logró hacerse.Los que chuparon de su creatividad para alimentar su propia creatividad.Tremendo artista Jodo.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"It doesn't only serve as a brilliant documentary about the greatest film never made, but also as a message to every ambitious filmmaker in the world and as a burst and reaction towards the extremely conservative nature of Hollywood. The world missed one of the greatest films ever."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Fantastic, please let him create a kickstarter, I wish so much that he would finally make it. He can have all of my money, just make it."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Proof that there is no limit to the imagination!
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"The story of an audacious, maddening, brilliant film that was never made. Jodorowsky will infect your mind with possibilities and you will never forget him."
0.0,jodorowskys_dune,Seriously? A documentary movie about a guy who thought about makin a revolutionary rehash of Dune. Who never made the freaking movie???? WTF really there's no movie?? I thought I was going to watch an awesome version of Dune.....Uhm horrible.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Jodorowsky's Dune is a fascinating examination of a maverick director's attempt to make his passion project - an adaptation of the classic sci-fi book Dune. Showing the creative process and the business side of moviemaking, it emphasizes the back and forth of crafting such an ambitious project."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Inspirational, funny, entertaining, and just an overall perfectly crafted documentary. I seriously wish Dune was made ugh."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Incredible. Jadorowsky is an amazing person and his genius and heart shines through. Tragic that this film never got made.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"wonderful, funny, transformative!"
0.0,jodorowskys_dune,Lame... unless you're on drugs at the time.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Fantastic documentary of a grand vision that Hollywood wouldn't make. It gives you a lot to think about. The novel in my opinion was the best sci-fi book ever written. Jodorowsky's take would have been a sight to see.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Thanks for give us an excellent journey.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,I hope some day someone can do that film. Like Jodorowsky.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Divertida y por completo enferma, las situaciones planteadas y las anécdotas contadas hacen por si solas un documental memorable."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Brilliant! Hollywood needs more artist and less accountants. Oh what might have been. I would love to see his vision in a CGI animated movie.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Jaw dropping, heart breaking, and incredibly inspiring."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"the best docu about the film you will never see,,, in this dimension at least!"
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,The failure of the Dune's project lead by Jodorowsky is just as big as his ambition with this project. Still today this movie remains a ground breaking movement in the Science Fiction movie genere. Even if it never came to be.This is by far the most inspiring documentary I have ever seen in my life.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"I hate what Hwood does to art and dreams.This must be made, one way or another."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,The story of the greatest film never made by an unsung genius. I will gush about this film and of Jodorowsky endlessly. We owe 30 years celebrated films to this man's passion and unrealized dreams.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,a tragedy this movie has never been made. the amount of dedication and ambition put into it and not then finalized is a loss for everyone.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"PLEASE COME TO VOD, VIDEO AND GET NOMINATED FOR AN OSCAR, YOU MAGNIFICENT FASCINATING CREATURE!"
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,What a brilliant man. I have mad respect for this guy!
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Few films dazzle and enthral with their ideas quite like this one. Jodorowsky's Dune offers an intriguing insight into a unique vision of the greatest sci-fi never filmed, made all the more captivating by the passion of Jodorowsky himself."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Gotta give this a full 5 stars, because this man's enthusiasm on every level... artistic, spiritual, life, etc. is so infectious... that alone is worth the price of admission."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Wow! What a visionary!!!
0.0,jodorowskys_dune,Weird does not begin to describe this. I have never been more thankful that David Lynch directed Dune rather than the tragic disaster this would have been.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Based on my Giger and O'Bannon's Alien obsessions, I had been somewhat aware of this failed film . What I was not aware of was how spectacular and insane, and unique it had been. One of the best studies of the human imagination you'll ever see."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Would love to see his version of Dune on the big screen!
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Insight into a mind of movie that was never made but did so much.

1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Jodorowsky. What a guy! Fab documenrary about a movie that was (sadly) never made. Interesting and inspirational. You'll think about it long after you leave the theatre.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Fantastic to think what this group of artist luminaries could have produced with Frank Herbert's masterpiece. One thing that bothered me though, seems like half the people involved in the almost-making of this movie never read the book!"
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Fascinating and inspiring.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Wonderful documentary that gives the needed respect for an extravert artist
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,The best movie I've seen all year.

1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Loved it - Here is a movie that was never made that changed the landscape of sci-fi films!
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,I want to see it again. It's phantasmagoric!!
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,A powerful film that champions the beauty of dreams and the sincerity of truly artistic ambition.

1.0,the_invisible_war,It is our duty as Americans and human beings to watch this excellent documentary. I have never felt so sad for my country and so convinced that justice is an illusion.
1.0,the_invisible_war,"The truly frightening part of the film is when they make the point that perpetrators of sexual assault, given such meaningless or non-existent punishment are released back into the military or society with training that would enable them to be that much more dangerous as sexual predators."
1.0,the_invisible_war,Heartbreaking and fucking infuriating.
1.0,the_invisible_war,Everyone needs to see this.

1.0,the_invisible_war,powerful and illuminating documentary about rape and sexual abuse in our military. A must see!
1.0,the_invisible_war,"Horrifying, moving, and very powerful. Though its focus is on women in the military, I was happy that it did not exclude men as the victims of sexual assault from this documentary, which is as big of a problem, and even more likely to go unreported."
1.0,the_invisible_war,"Horrifying to know that this is reality and to think what kind of people are the ones, who are supposed to protect us"
1.0,the_invisible_war,EVERYONE needs to see this.

1.0,the_invisible_war,"""Support the troops"" my ass."
1.0,the_invisible_war,A well presented piece that exposes a very corrupt process (or lack thereof) in the U.S. military. It should win at the 85th Academy Awards. Hopefully the reaction to the documentary will impact change in the system.

1.0,the_invisible_war,Documentary on the sexual harassment military
1.0,the_invisible_war,"it was sad to see the men and women in uniform breaking down when justice isn't delivered.

1.0,the_invisible_war,"While I had always known that there were problems with rape and sexual harassment in the military, I was shocked at the extent of the problem and how little the leadership is doing to correct the problem. Hopefully, this is a first step in fixing the problem. This needs to be fixed now!"

0.0,cave_of_forgotten_dreams,boooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
1.0,cave_of_forgotten_dreams,It's the best use of 3D I've yet seen. I want to see it again. You will probably never get another chance to see these amazing ancient artworks in this kind of detail. Don't miss it.
1.0,cave_of_forgotten_dreams,"Aside from a few Herzog moments, this really is an important film. It's truly haunting. As in the film, it takes time to absorb and comprehend the implications of this place."
0.0,cave_of_forgotten_dreams,So boring. I left early.
1.0,cave_of_forgotten_dreams,"As annoying as I find Herzog, he always makes the best movies and documentaries. This is worth seeing in the theater and in 3-D."
1.0,cave_of_forgotten_dreams,"A must for any lover of painting. Enchanting, though I would have liked more information on the tools and techniques of the prehistoric artists."
1.0,cave_of_forgotten_dreams,"A wonderful, immersive experience. For once, 3d is more than a gimmick, so see it in the cinema if you can."
0.0,cave_of_forgotten_dreams,Very repetitious. Pompous. And filmed with a hand held camera
1.0,cave_of_forgotten_dreams,"There's a lot to say about this movie and the ""cavemen"" whose art is gorgously displayed by Herzog, but there's probably a higher value in just saying nothing and gazing in awe."
1.0,cave_of_forgotten_dreams,"Werner Herzog's latest documentary takes us into the stunning Chauvet Cave in France, home to 30,000-year old cave paintings. The critics are right...this IS the best use of 3-D since Avatar. Absolutely a must-see!"
1.0,cave_of_forgotten_dreams,"Excellent movie, especially for the Homo spiritualis among us (although it's great for those of us who are Homo sapiens too!)."
0.0,cave_of_forgotten_dreams,"What a dull, repetitive and pretentious piece of crap. I learned absolutely nothing from this film. Documentary at it's worst. I felt like I was back in primary school watching some school assembly guest speaker's slideshow. Snooze city."
1.0,cave_of_forgotten_dreams,"See this movie in 3D! Really amazing images. Well worth waiting in line to get in. A great example of the potential of 3D. But the true star of the show is the artist who painted the cave images 32,000 years ago. Hughly recommended!"
0.0,cave_of_forgotten_dreams,Great discovery and potential to be something amazing. But Herzog gets lazy and the movie is a bore. How many repeated shots of same cave paintings can one bare?
1.0,cave_of_forgotten_dreams,"Werner Herzog is on a roll. One of the most fascinating documentaries ever produced - stunning in 3D. If you do not see this film, you are (a) not human (b) without a soul or (c) both."
0.0,cave_of_forgotten_dreams,"boring, slow paced, monotone narration, poor quality of 3d"
1.0,cave_of_forgotten_dreams,I didn't see it in 3D....but the film is a masterpiece. I wist I could get ahold of a copy of the film's poster!!!
0.0,cave_of_forgotten_dreams,half hour special on pbs would have been sufficient. or if you need a nap....
1.0,cave_of_forgotten_dreams,"An event documentary of the discovery of a million lifetimes, priceless, must-see. Brought to you by the number 3 and the letter D."
1.0,cave_of_forgotten_dreams,Extraordinary! (Also features eccentric french people)
1.0,cave_of_forgotten_dreams,"As good as always!!! You leave the cinema asking yourself, and your partner loads of questions! The Q&A; with Herzog was really worth waiting for!!! ;-)"
1.0,49_up,I definitely don't think this series was meant to be binge-watched. It's almost too much to wrap your mind around. It's crazy how many of the participants are upset about being on the series when it doesn't seem like it goes THAT deep to me. I still love it.
1.0,49_up,"And again they look back, this time with gratefulness and nostalgia. I like the fact that Michael was not just the interrogator here but he was actually part of it, observing with them and looking back about how he had been a part of their lives and how his project shaped them."
1.0,49_up,Captivating psychological biography. One of the best.
1.0,49_up,wow. awesome. watch this.
1.0,49_up,One of the greatest filmic experiments of all time
1.0,49_up,Such a good idea! Super good doc. Keep the good stuff coming!
1.0,49_up,Greatest documentary series ever. 56 up coming out soon.
1.0,49_up,Great series though I wasn't one of the people that apparently grew up watching it every seven years. I came by it via a Roger Ebert review.
1.0,49_up,amazing. i can't wait for the next installment
1.0,49_up,Best in a long time. Loved it completely. Only problem with it is having to wait three years for the next one!!! Yikes!
1.0,49_up,it was soooo interesting!
1.0,49_up,"Highly recommended for anyone with an interest in sociology, psychology, cultural studies, or class/political issues. I have to admit, Apted comes off as a pretty pompous fellow in the Ebert interview... but Ebert's respect for the genius of this documentary idea kinda makes up for it."
1.0,49_up,"Glad to see things getting better for every one in terms of every one more 'comfortable in their own skins. One of the less depressing episodes, besides how they all aged immensely since 42, but the filled out features make them look more like their seven year old versions. '"
1.0,49_up,"I have now seen the whole series, to date. This is a fascinating look at the lives and feelings of real people, as they are revisited every seven years. Can't wait for the next one, but that won't be until 2013!"
1.0,49_up,Outstanding series of movies. Should be shown in high schools everywhere.
1.0,49_up,Absolutely Fascinating! Makes me want to watch the rest of the Up film series.
1.0,49_up,I have watched the whole series to date now. This particular movie struck me as to how almost every participant findly found themselves between 42 Up and this installment and how much the age shows on each subject as a result.
1.0,49_up,incredible documentary series
1.0,49_up,these are such good documentary social experiments that everyone should see once
1.0,49_up,the best documentary series ever. i can't say enough good things about them.
1.0,49_up,I'll take Neil Hughes' faith over George Bush's any day.
1.0,49_up,"I haven't seen any of the previous installments, but I was really really amazed by this film... It has a very strange and wonderful quality to it..."
1.0,49_up,"This is my favorite of the series so far. I love seeing how far some of them have come and hearing what happened to others. I also was intrigued by several of them saying they didn't like doing it, but they felt like they had to for whatever reasons they might have."
1.0,49_up,I just can't explain how much I was affected by this film and the whole series of documentaries it belongs to. It's fascinating to see these people as young children and then look at their lives as adults. I'm especially glad Neil is in a better place in his life now. Wonderful.
1.0,49_up,This filmed over whelmed me like nothing I have seen. There is nothing that can replicate this. There is nothing that can match its impact.
1.0,49_up,one of the most amazing documentary projects ever done. more real than any reality television you could ever imagine.
1.0,49_up,A movie that continuously sticks with me. It documents the life of four (?)people since they were seven years old. There's a new one in the series every seven years. The latest being 49 Up. It is absolutely fascinating what has become of everyone. It definitely tops my favourite documentary list.
1.0,49_up,"brilliant, well-edited, and interesting. wow, looks are fleeting."
1.0,49_up,Fascinating. Every one in the series has been great!
1.0,49_up,absolutely incredible.
1.0,49_up,Michael Apted's journey into film history continues with another real film of pure brilliance. Honesty rarely can be put better on film. Nell is my favorite one to watch since the 80's edition.Number 6 on my 06 list.
1.0,49_up,"Better reality viewing than today's ""reality tv""."
1.0,49_up,"I've rated it 5 stars for the whole series, which is a unique monument in the history of film.Get on Netflix and watch them all in order for the full experience."
1.0,49_up,The entire series is a fascinating and somewhat depressing movie experience; a unique look at the human experience.
1.0,49_up,excellent documentary about seven children which british film continues to film them every 7 years from the time that the children are 6 until they are in their 40's and how life has changed for them. very well made. highly recommended.
1.0,49_up,neil makes me feel complete
1.0,49_up,The entire Up Series is the greatest thing ever filmed. 49 up is just the latest in the series. Go buy the box set today!
1.0,49_up,Do yourself a favor and watch this entire series.
1.0,49_up,Probably the most interesting documentary (or series of documentaries) ever.
1.0,49_up,Ever since my Dad put me onto this I've been hooked. I feel a bit dirty after watching... but so intrigued. It's like a really long wait for your favourite soap opera. I've heard that Apted has hung up the camera though on this one...
1.0,49_up,"If you watch one documentary in your life, watch this one, or any of its previous incarnations. Brilliant. Just thinking about the work that must have been done to make this series is staggering."
1.0,49_up,I was first shown this series of films in my Sociology 201 class. This is an interesting look into the human social structure from the point of view from these individuals.
1.0,49_up,This entire series is fascinating. I'm already eagerly anticipating 56 Up.
1.0,49_up,Can't wait 'till 56 up!
1.0,49_up,"The latest installment from Michael Apted's ""Up Series"". One of the best documentary series of all time."
1.0,49_up,The entire Up series is an astonishing accomplishment that literally ONLY gets better as time goes by.

1.0,no_end_in_sight,"Required viewing for politically-attentive viewers, No End in Sight delivers a worthy report and digs up a lot of dirt on the choices that resulted in the chaos of Iraq."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,Absolutely amazing. What they expose is very frustrating and very hard to watch and listen to. It is a must see if you want a few answers. But just a few.
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"This film is as well crafted as it is cringe-inducing and infuriating. I wish there was a little more focus on Bush's initial manipulations to get us into Iraq, but that is a very minor quibble. This is an extremely important documentary that far too few in this nation will probably see."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"One of the most important documents of our time. Gets inside and understands how the Iraq War was conducted and how it was planned (or ill-planned, I should say). Absolutely fascinating."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,Such an important historical document that will great inform its audiences now and in the future. It also works as art - such a great film.
1.0,no_end_in_sight,It's getting harder to remember what it was like before.
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"I just thought I knew how fucked up the Iraq War was. 7,000 years worth of artifacts from some of the earliest civilizations were burned to the ground in Iraqi museums and our soldiers had explicit orders not to stop the looting. FUCK"
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"This is basically a fabulous hunk of info about the war for dummies. It is insightful, its HONEST, and I for one appreciate how the angle is compassionate for humans vs anger towards the government. Besides 'The cove' this has to be my favorite documentary ever."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"Ever wondered why there is still insurgency in Iraq even after 8 years, this movie answers the fundamental questions."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"Aside from the US govt's dubious reasons for going to war in Iraq, the resultant behaviour displayed by Rumsfeld, Wolfewitz, Rice, Bremer et al is nothing short of idiotic. It's frightening to think that so much power is held in the hands of such ignorant, vindictive self-righteous philistines."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,All this time I thought the Iraq war was a bad idea. Now I think it could have been good if idiots hadnt been running the show. Still teary eyed from the reality

1.0,no_end_in_sight,"This is the Iraq war. From start to..., well anyways. It details with candid facts the history of the war in Iraq by actual government officials who were there and involved in the whole process. We fucked up big time, and now there is no going back."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"A ""disturbing documentary"" that will move anyone who cares. A great look at gov't bureaucracy at its best. Tennis anyone?"
1.0,no_end_in_sight,Until I saw this movie I didn't really understand just how inept and indifferent the Bush administration was about the Iraq War. That ineptness and indifference have cost a civilization its heritage and hundreds of thousands of people their lives.
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"No End in Sight was very informative. To me, the overarching theme was that the United States government is not at all ""one"" thing. It has many heads and not every head knows what the others are doing."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,10/10 No End in Sight removes the conspiracy-mongering ideas and interviewees and uses credible sources and informants to formulate it's argument against American incompetence with handling the war in Iraq.

1.0,no_end_in_sight,"MUST SEE movie #2 of the year for all U.S. voters (Carrier series was the other). Reaffirms my old point that it matters less who you vote for but who you vote for will appoint. Appointed offices have scary power, as you will see."

1.0,no_end_in_sight,"Everything Michael Moore wishes he could do in a documentary. The best I have seen, hands down."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,A truely horrific documentary that really highlights the lack of planning and thought that went into the rebuilding of Iraq after the American invasion. Ferguson coaxes some brilliant insights from thew right people and the films editing and distribution of information is a thing of beauty.
1.0,no_end_in_sight,A great documentary on the problems in Iraq and how bad decisions from a bad administration has only made it worse.
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"A real eye-opener, a must see film for all humanitarians. It really makes you question the motives of those in power as well as the reasons nations have for going to war. One of the best documentary films to come by in a long time. I highly recommend it."

1.0,no_end_in_sight,Truth shall set us free!

1.0,no_end_in_sight,I wish this was fiction...
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"One of the most influential docs I have seen, ever. for me at least. For once a doc on this topic was put out with people who actually know what they are talking about. The interviews were great. The footage that was used in between interviews was amazing."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,All the idiots that voted for bushwad should have to sit and watch this.
1.0,no_end_in_sight,Arguably the best documentary I've ever seen. A devastating indictment of the current administrations mishandling of the war in Iraq.
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"This should play every Sunday on every news network for six months. It outlines the mistakes made up until 2006 in Iraq, and it kills your soul."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,Excellent film that explains the origin of the quagmire in Iraq. The U.S. created it. Very illuminating of U.S. policy.
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"ferguson is my newest hero, alongside gibney. but as with the others, just a shame that the people who need to see this most won't, ie, bush supporters. also, like the others, it's a must-see."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,Explains so much on so many levels. What intrigued me the most about the film is symmatry between the elaborate obfuscation systems Bush concocted to cover up his utter lack of planning and the American corporate management styles now in vogue.
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"Great insight into the flawed decision making that escalated the war into what it is today. Commentary by military personnel involved in the initial phases of the war are especially effective. Whatever your political inclinations are, watch this film."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,It's simply and sadly the tale of things going from worse to incomprehensible.Grade: A
1.0,no_end_in_sight,Future generations will look back on this and wonder how our nation let these goons run our country for EIGHT YEARS (12 if you count the first Bush) without any recriminations. The damage will never be undone.

1.0,no_end_in_sight,"Even if half of this movie is true, it is a depressing yet insightful glimpse into the mistakes of the Iraqi war and how so many bad decisions can create the huge mess we are in now."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,POWERFUL! 1.8 Trillion dollar mistake ....
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"A have to watch ! Gives insight of what Bush Admin is doing to Iraq, Iraqi people and to its own troops."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,I couldn't imagine a better film to document the Iraq war. They took the time to actually interview the administration officials in charge of the reconstruction as well as strategists. This is an honest depiction of one of our countries biggest blunders.

1.0,no_end_in_sight,"Powerful & tragic. The coverage, detail, & footage of the weeks before the invasion and the 3-4 months leading up to the insurgency provided amazing historical context for the present conditions and explained in wonderful detail how it was so mismanaged."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,Should be required viewing for everyone who is planning to vote in the fall.
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"AUGH. Our leaders are inept, ignorant and plainly evil. This movie shows why Iraq is such a clusterfuck, and why it didn't have to be."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"A very important bit of history laid down on tape for the archives. The sad thing is that we came so close to doing this right, but the wrong people were in charge. And those people are too scared to talk about it"

1.0,no_end_in_sight,Please watch this.It is so important.
1.0,no_end_in_sight,everyone should see this. Hubris getting in the way of common sense and ideology over expertise usually doesn't turn out well. Excellent view of what went on the last 8 years and provides a different view than the infotainment of Michael Moore..
1.0,no_end_in_sight,yes it is a biased but it shows that there were elements of American administration that wanted to do the right thing but were vetoed or ignored. History will not forgive us so easily and nor will the people of Iraq.
1.0,no_end_in_sight,Absolutely amazing. Very cool-headed in presenting information.
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"yeah, everyone and their mothers should see this movie. and it is not another bush-hating rant. this one places blame on many members of the administration."

1.0,no_end_in_sight,I have been disappointed with the mess in Iraq since early on. This movie did not help. Every American needs to watch this movie and act to make sure this never happens again.

1.0,no_end_in_sight,"Good movie to see if you want an update as to what is really happening in Iraq. You'd think that after all the other ""experience"" that the US has in the aftermath of war they would have learned something."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,If you only learn one thing let it be the word quagmire. This movie really let you see what was going on behind the scenes.

1.0,no_end_in_sight,"A well-executed eye-opener. Bush and his cronies are dumb, dishonest, incompetent and immoral. They have done more harm to Iraq than Saddam has. They are no less worthy of his noose."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"We're (America) going to pay for our arrogance for a VERY long time. The last 8 years have been a complete embarrassment, a shambles and an epic lie. Definitely NOT a movie you want to see if you're a Bush kool-aid drinker (and thankfully there aren't too many of you around any more!)."

1.0,no_end_in_sight,"impressive film that is quite thought provoking, though i would love to hear what the commentators would propose as solutions to the current crisis"
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"This film is as well crafted as it is cringe-inducing and infuriating. I wish there was a little more focus on Bush's initial manipulations to get us into Iraq, but that is a very minor quibble. This is an extremely important documentary that far too few in this nation will probably see."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"""Quagmire? I don't do quagmires!"" My neck is sore from shaking my head in disbelief. Great film."

1.0,no_end_in_sight,"Please see this. Everyone. And, then remember this movie in November. Please."

1.0,no_end_in_sight,"Every American citizen should watch this movie. Directed by Ferguson, a Brookings Fellow an political centrist. This movie examines the Iraq war from inception to present in a balanced and factual fashion. This film has an agenda - but it is not a partisan political one."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,This movie pisses me off!!! I am glad that there are people that see the Bush Administration to be no different than Hitler's Germany. Bush's America should be penitent. The entire Bush Administration should be arrested and maybe even executed for war-crimes.
0.0,no_end_in_sight,"Awful. The synopsis claims it's based on ""over 200 hours of footage."" That's exactly what it feels like. No End In Sight, indeed."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"This is a phenommenal documentary. It presents the invasion of Iraq through a number of different people's points of view, including people that were chosen to head programs for Iraq (i.e. Republicans).

1.0,no_end_in_sight,"Searing and powerful, this is by far the best documentary yet on the war and far and away the most powerful documentary of the year. To say what has already been said over and over about this film: You owe it to yourself and your country to see this."

1.0,no_end_in_sight,"An extremely credible non-partisan documentary on the way the Iraq War was mishandled. If you still believe that the Bushies are anything but incompetents and war profiteers after watching this movie, then you are a qualified fool."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"They didn't interview talking heads, here- these are the people who were involved. And what they have to say is freaking surreal."

1.0,no_end_in_sight,Fantastic doc with emphasis on the details surrounding the why and how of the insurgency in Iraq. It's amazing to see exactly how the whole thing was fumbled rather than just hearing blanket statements about the administration's incompetency.
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"Everyone needs to see this, this is astonishing.
