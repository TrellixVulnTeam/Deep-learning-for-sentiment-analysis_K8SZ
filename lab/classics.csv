1.0,rosemarys_baby,"Instead of resorting to violence and gore, it draws you into the lives of its characters with an uneasiness and growing sense of dread. The director plays its audience like a piano, the suspense rivalling that of an Alfred Hitchcock picture."

1.0,rosemarys_baby,There's really nothing else like it.

1.0,rosemarys_baby,"3º vez que assisto esse filme, continuo achando genial."
1.0,rosemarys_baby,"Not so much a horror film as pure suspense, Rosemary's Baby is a master tale of deception, betrayal and denial. The performances are awesome, Mia Farrow takes you on an emotional roller coaster. The film has an unsettling feel to it, but its not ""scary""."
1.0,rosemarys_baby,"Horror films don't get any better than this. One of my personal top 20 favorites horror films, and one of the few I recommend to non-horror fans. It's an excellent introductory or an awesome classic to watch over and over."
1.0,rosemarys_baby,"Incredibly tense and horrific throughout, despite its age. Roman Polanski clearly knows how to sustain dread. That said, this is an effed up movie, and really disturbing. Rosemary acts like a fool the entire time, digging her own grave. Clearly made with a pre-feminist sensibility."

1.0,rosemarys_baby,It is refreshing to go back to a classic movie that gets horror right without mutilation and stupidity. One of my new favorite horror movies.
1.0,rosemarys_baby,scary atmosphere and haunting direction...
1.0,rosemarys_baby,I want my wife to be Mia Farrow after watching this sadistic gem.
1.0,rosemarys_baby,Phew !This classic horror movie will resonate till I see the last movie in my lie. Wonder why I could not watch it at least 20 years earlier than yesterday ?
1.0,rosemarys_baby,"To make its premise work Ã¢ÂÂ"" in other words, scare the hell out of you Ã¢ÂÂ"" Polanski had to get EVERYTHING right. And he did. From the first scene the viewer is drawn in, and there's no letting go, even when it's over."
1.0,rosemarys_baby,"Mia Farrow is beautiful. In her acting and in her cute, girlish yet womanly charm. The rest is also pretty perfect."

1.0,rosemarys_baby,Great Movie! So sad i didn't see it earlier :(
1.0,rosemarys_baby,"John Cassavetes was such a great actor, as well as a great director."
1.0,rosemarys_baby,A particularly modern horror film that exploits particularly adult fears. Farrow's performance is charged with such a subtly growing desperation that we manage to feel terrified during scenes shot on crowded streets in broad daylight.
1.0,rosemarys_baby,Hale Satan! Hale Satan!-Brilliant writing. Extremely well made. Best horror film(only if you don't count Jaws as a horror movie)
0.0,rosemarys_baby,I guess its just outdated for me but this movie was average at best! For its time it may have been great but it is not a timeless masterpiece that everyone says it is

1.0,rosemarys_baby,Mia Farrow gives the performance of her lifetime in a truly unique film (which barely veers from the novel) helmed by master Roman Polanski. One of the best of the 60s.
1.0,rosemarys_baby,"Four Thumbs Up!!!!, A Classic Classic!!!. :-*"
1.0,rosemarys_baby,"Driven by Polanski's modern direction and a knock-out performance from Farrow, ""Rosemary's Baby"" is a terrifying story of a mother, her baby, and the friendly neighborhood satanist cult living next door."
1.0,rosemarys_baby,This is a Horror Classic.
1.0,rosemarys_baby,"Totally great. A classic. A must-see for all horror fans. Great cast, build-up, plot, etc. Everything about this movie is amazing. I'd highly recommend it!!! One of the best horror films of the time... and in general."

1.0,rosemarys_baby,"Bizarre, disturbing, absurd, perfect."
1.0,rosemarys_baby,"Great horror flick, especially when you figure when it was made. Too bad Polanski is such a douche. He surely would have made many more great films if he didnt like to rape young girls so much."
1.0,rosemarys_baby,"Still the creepiest horror film of all time, in my opinion."
1.0,rosemarys_baby,"Part of the ""Shining""-""Exorcist""-""Rosemary's"" trifecta of greatest horror movies ever made."

1.0,rosemarys_baby,one of the best horror films of all time.
1.0,rosemarys_baby,"A masterpiece. Mia Farrow made Rosemary's Baby the classic it is today, her acting is damn near flawless. One of the best horror films of all time, yet it really isn't too disturbing or scary. Rosemary's Baby is a slow-building, satanic work of art."
1.0,rosemarys_baby,Es tan oscura y posee una profundidad sofocante con cada plano.
1.0,rosemarys_baby,"Subtle, haunting, and almost the most paranoid of Polanski's films, Rosemary's Baby is among the greatest horror films ever made and it still makes other horror films inferior by comparission."

1.0,rosemarys_baby,"Great movie. Classic. Dark, disturbing, very close to the book, with a great performance from Farrow. I know what happened to them, but I wanted to see the baby's eyes!"
1.0,rosemarys_baby,Brilliant cinematography. Certainly one of my favourite films.
1.0,rosemarys_baby,"Polanski's direction elevated the film beyond the material's potential schlock, shifting between dream imagery and reality so often that your never quite sure what's going on. Ruth Gordon and the rest of the building tenants are the quirkiest devil worshipers to ever grace the screen."
0.0,rosemarys_baby,wasnt even scary. boo.
1.0,rosemarys_baby,Even better than the perfection I remember. Pitch perfect from beginning to end. Judicious shocks and perfect restraint. The paranoia throughout is palpable. This movie still hits on all cylinders.

1.0,rosemarys_baby,"Rosemary's Baby is a terrifying tale of motherhood and the occult made all the more unsettling by authentic, dedicated performances from Mia Farrow and Ruth Gordon."
1.0,rosemarys_baby,"The story is so well-handled by Roman Polanski. Rosemary's Baby, combining Satanism with pregnancy, creates a tense atmosphere that is enclosed and mysterious, using effective dialogue, cinematography, and acting to set the tone."
1.0,rosemarys_baby,You'll hear and hear the Rosemary's Baby' song in your dreams.
1.0,rosemarys_baby,So deliciously dark and thought provoking. One of the best endings in cinema history

0.0,rosemarys_baby,"I can't stand the movie, but I love the book. So i'm being biased..."
1.0,rosemarys_baby,"Brilliant suspenseful psychological thriller that is at times scary and other times funny.

1.0,rosemarys_baby,"Rosemary's Baby is Roman Polanski's witchcraft, masterpiece of eerie and shivering tale."
0.0,rosemarys_baby,I thought a classic would be great to see but it turned out to just put me to sleep. Sure the end isn't horrible after you struggle to get through over an hour of boring storylines and parts that are very confusing.

1.0,rosemarys_baby,in my top 10 of all time
0.0,rosemarys_baby,Wow what a depressing movie. I had a high expectation of this movie. I was watching this movie with the mentality that this movie was made decades ago.

0.0,rosemarys_baby,This film was obnoxcious and unscary. If you want a frightening 60's flick I would recommend Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho(1960) but dont waste your time with Rosemary's Baby(1968).
1.0,rosemarys_baby,A slow burner with a grand pay-off.

1.0,rosemarys_baby,Another Rowan polanski classic. This I the 3rd five star rating I've given to a Polanski (Along with Chinatown and the Pianist). It's a sick and twisted film and I would put it alongside Eraserhead for the most fucked up film. It is great and Is directed by the greatest director ever Rowan Polanski
0.0,rosemarys_baby,I like how it didn't seem to try to make viewers feel stupid even though it was made and set longer ago. The story got me so lost that I could only watch part of it.
1.0,rosemarys_baby,"that what real horror is about, psychological mess! classis!!!"
1.0,rosemarys_baby,"I feel the dreadful loss of trust in all who surround Rosemary, it were as if she was drowning in a sea of lies and evil that encompassed the entirety of her pregnancy. Every helping hand a deceptive one. This movie is horrifying."

1.0,rosemarys_baby,Thought the movie was really good... Even watching it now oppose to when it first came out. The outdated film gives it a even more creepy unsettling effect. I can see why it is one of the top classic scary movies though I don't find it scary just creepy and eerie
1.0,rosemarys_baby,"To be scared without actually ever seeing anything, that's the biggest acomplishment I can think of a director can make in a movie."
1.0,rosemarys_baby,"A film that's not only one of Roman Polanski and William Castle's best films, but one of the best films of all time whether we're talking about best horror or best film in general, be sure not to miss the devilishly creepy 'Rosemary's Baby'."
1.0,rosemarys_baby,"Some classics never go out of style. Rosemary's baby slowly creates an oppressive, claustrophobic atmosphere, emerging as a subtle critique of a culture that deifies motherhood while belittling femininity. Still as horrifying and relevant as the day it came out."
0.0,rosemarys_baby,"No not a horror-movie, but a Zombie-movie: I turn into one while watching because of boredom. If this is horror, ""Home Alone"" is a over 18-thriller."

0.0,the_leopard_1963,Definitely not worth 3 hours...an hour of it must have been the kissing and dancing scenes alone. This movie was wayy to slow paced and drawn out than it needed to be.

1.0,the_leopard_1963,"A little like Gone With the Wind, but set in 1860 Italy during the unification. Martin Scorsese says everyone should see this movie....I agree -- it's pretty magnificent. The 35mm restoration is probably playing at an art house theater near you!"

1.0,the_leopard_1963,"An unparalleled historical epic, with an inspired international cast, brilliant directing, gorgeous photography... If you think ballroom scenes are only for those who like to look at elegant clothes and dancing, then the final scene of this film will be a revelation."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"3 hrs and 25 mins. of Visconti directing Lancaster, Cardinale and Delon. You're either on board or you've mizzed the boat. One of the most beautifully filmed movies ever.

1.0,the_leopard_1963,"Tragically ironic and wonderful and joyous. Burt Lancaster gives a truly staggering performance, under the superb hand of Visconti.

1.0,the_leopard_1963,Visconti and neorealism in Italy

1.0,the_leopard_1963,"One of the most beautiful films ever made, the much famed ball sequence, which takes up the last 1/2 hour is one of the best set sequences ever filmed. The full version is finally available in a subtitled print, however Lancaster spoke English is dubbed into Italian and subtitled back into English!"
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"Class struggles, generational differences and individual morality on Sicily and on a great scale. As awe-inspiring as Gone With the Wind, but at least twice as intelligent."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,certaily the best piece of Burt Lancaster. One of the best films of 60's. And what can be said about Claudia Cardinale.She is the pretiest woman on screen- I guess.
1.0,the_leopard_1963,An absolute gem...what photography...true to the novel in every detail...amazing...but it's Visconti after all...
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"The best way I can describe it, which doesn't do it justice, is the Italian Gone with the wind. However, that's because it takes place during Italy's defining moments.

1.0,the_leopard_1963,"Que delicioso retrato de la aristocracia y de la sociedad italiana. Que claridad para ver las relaciones sociales entre los habitantes del pueblo, entre el pueblo y el poder. La escena del banquete, la figura y la risa espectacular de Claudia Cardinale son inolvidables."

1.0,rashomon,Great Story. It's what movies were made for. great even.
1.0,rashomon,":') masterpiece.......en serio, eso es lo unico que se puede decir."
1.0,rashomon,Was captured by the story and the twisted truth.
1.0,rashomon,"Completely innovative, and mainly a masterpiece, both on screen, and behind the camera. It's brilliantly acted, written, and directed, and proves that not all movies have to be films. Some can be metaphors."

1.0,rashomon,Behind 'Seven Samurai' as Kurosawa's best.
1.0,rashomon,Epitome of story telling.

1.0,rashomon,"Primeiro filme de Kurosawa que eu assisti. Uma verdadeira aula de jornalismo: nÃ£o existe verdade absoluta e sim versÃµes da verdade e bons argumentos, ou maus."
1.0,rashomon,One of my top 10 films of all time. Great insight into the human psyche and astounding performances from Kurosawa's band of unknowns.
1.0,rashomon,:O TRUTH - What is it???
0.0,rashomon,"maybe significant, but a chore to watch"
1.0,rashomon,It's Rashomon. Rashomon.
1.0,rashomon,Everything is done perfectly in this film. Akira Kurosawa's innovative filmmaking is quite interestingly one of the best
1.0,rashomon,A tour de force thought-provoking allegorical masterpiece concerning human sophisticating nature.

1.0,rashomon,"100% Yes, it's that good."
1.0,rashomon,Rashomon was a very interesting movie and surpirsed me that they were able to make come from five different points of views. This was also other master piece by Akira Kurosawa.
1.0,rashomon,One of my favorite Kurosawa movies and an exercise on truth. Beautiful photography.
1.0,rashomon,"Friggin Masterpiece. A murder drama done well to exploit the highs and lows of humanity. painfully misogynistic, but so were those times."
1.0,rashomon,"I can sit here and talk about a film's writing, or character development, or editing and cinematography and just go on a giant spiel, when I could really just say four words. I loved this movie!"
1.0,rashomon,Would have to say that this is my favorite of Kurosawa's.
1.0,rashomon,Another excellent example of Kurosawa's art -- A master of the Cinema working in top form.
1.0,rashomon,"I don't need to write a review of this. I've been so taken with this film I've watched it 5 times over the course of the week. I've been dumbfounded to find that students in one of my film classes found it boring, slow, and melodramatic."
1.0,rashomon,"i thought this movie was really planned out and a great success. i don't think there was one specific genre. because i did laugh, but there were dramatic parts as well. great movie."
1.0,rashomon,"See the 2008 restored version, as it just looks and sounds incredible. If you have never seen Rashomon, then there's so much to learn about film narative, film technique, and film history. Kurosawa's first (of many) true masterpieces, and every time you watch it, you will see it differently."
1.0,rashomon,Everyone's got a reason to lie........this gets better every time I see it.
1.0,rashomon,"Ho. Ly. Fuck. This movie is truly incredible. The way in which Kurosawa approaches the topic of reality as being entirely subjective is incredible. While people have copied many of the ideas in this film, if you look at it in terms of the time it was truly revolutionary. What a movie."
1.0,rashomon,The key to a Japanese woman heart if you don't want to know what is Bunraku.
1.0,rashomon,Rewatching this for the first time in many years. Timeless. Fucking. Classic.
0.0,rashomon,Watched it on TCM with Bill Hader's guest commentary. Splendour in form.
1.0,rashomon,"What's so good about this movie? It hasn't aged, it's simple yet striking. (struck me completely), we all know we are subjective, but to what level does subjectivity affect our views? Found this movie so profound. Simply brilliant."
1.0,rashomon,"An intriguing story, fantastic acting, and expert directing combine to form another classic from Kurosawa, delivering an indepth look at the idea of truth and the purpose of life and its trials."
1.0,rashomon,"I think this is actually better than seven samurai (there, I said it). more style, more seriousness, more heart, and more thought, I cannot understand why this isn't regarded as Kurosawa's greatest achievement."
1.0,rashomon,"This was my first Kurosawa movie ever. I saw it way back in middle school, and it started my love affair with his films. Almost a ""who dun it?"" that talks about the human condition, if you haven't seen this film go watch it. If you have, go watch it again. your view of it might change."
1.0,rashomon,Kurosawa Japan best. Big-time movie! Yes?
1.0,rashomon,A powerful look at subjectivity.
1.0,rashomon,"Sure, it's not packed with tons of action, but it's very emotional, very suspenseful, and very simple in its presentation which adds an extra element of elegance and sophistication; all with an ending that makes you reflect on your own selfishness. The symbolism and metaphors were tops."
1.0,rashomon,A true masterpiece in all aspects..with unheard of use of camera nddynamic lighting..akira kurosawa's classic is a feast even today..the presentation of story..suspense merged with courtroom drama..inspired countless movies nd has left a legacy.. a must watch for all movie lovers...
1.0,rashomon,One of my favorites.
1.0,rashomon,"Excelent, one of the best movies by Kurosava , I saw it for first time when I was 8 since that time i saw I couple of times and still amazes me..."
1.0,rashomon,"Blew me away. Akira Kurosawa towers above most other directors in the 20th century and this is no exception. Rashomon is leagues above all other films in the 50's, equaled only by Kurosawa's other classics."
1.0,rashomon,"Not just a masterpiece, it's practically part of the periodic table of cinema."
1.0,rashomon,"My Rating: 95% .  Beautiful, Haunting, Surreal and Bittersweet. Rashomon is a film that is spot on and very true."
1.0,rashomon,"If you've never seen a film by Akira Kurosawa, this is a good start. He also made Throne of Blood, a samurai Macbeth and Ran, based on Shakespeare's King Lear."
1.0,rashomon,Akira's best work! So many filmmakers have tried to capture the essence of this film. Nothing beats the original.
1.0,rashomon,"Fascinating, influential drama which despite its age still has the power to provoke and astonish."
1.0,rashomon,"An exquisitely rendered representation of perception, human brokenness, and the hopeless bravely hoping despite these odds."
1.0,rashomon,"Kurosawa's best...Employs a multi-flashback recounting the same incident, as a plot device.. 60 years on and filmmakers all over the world still get inspired by this classic!!!"
1.0,rashomon,"A timeless masterpiece in world cinema.....and I feel Toshiro Mifune, as Tajomaru the bandit, does a better ""Raavan"" act than Abhishek Bachchan as Beera...."
1.0,rashomon,A brilliant movie that has been poorly copied many times since its release.
1.0,rashomon,"This movie leads a new form of narrative and photography. Great scenario: the gate of the city, the rain... Marvelous!"
1.0,rashomon,"MystÃ©rieux, d'une modernitÃ© sans Ã©gale et incroyablement prenant. Toshiro Mifune est dÃ©ment."
1.0,rashomon,"""I don't mind a lie, so long as it's interesting,"" says the cynic. Another way to look at it is that everything is true, that the stories don't fit because of what others overlooked in their pride."
0.0,rashomon,"The music in the movie was horrible. The whole thing is black and white, which is terrible. Some of the acting was terribly overacted. The fight scenes were fakey.On top of that, it's a horribly disgusting story.Yep, terrible and horrible describe it best."
1.0,rashomon,"An impressive foreign film that leaves you guessing to the very end. Visually stunning, and so poetic even Shakespeare would have been proud. One of my new favorite films, if you know what a good movie can be without CGI or a big budget, definitely see this film."
1.0,rashomon,"In league with Ikiru, its full of sorrow and mystery."
1.0,rashomon,"It is a testament to Akira Kurosawa that he can get away with risking everything making such an original movie as this. You must remember, in 1950, Rashomon was unheard of."
1.0,rashomon,a Kurosawa Akira film
1.0,rashomon,"Even though it's now coming on sixty years old, Rashomon hasnt aged a day. With its new state of the art digital restoration its never been a better time to catch this masterpiece."
1.0,rashomon,One of the all time great films . A definite must see!
1.0,rashomon,One of the best films ever made.
1.0,rashomon,"My all time favorite movie. A fantastic study of human nature, egotism, and our propensity to lie. Add in Kurosawa's amazing cinematography and you have one of the greatest films of all time."
1.0,rashomon,Fucking great picture
1.0,rashomon,Classic samurai drama.
1.0,rashomon,"Genial pelÃ­cula, rupturista y con una gran profundidad, sobre todo en cuanto a la naturaleza humana y la subjetividad. Un maestro Kurosawa."
1.0,rashomon,One of Kurosawa's best and one of the most influential films of all time. Toshiro Mifune gives another great performance as do the rest of the cast.
1.0,rashomon,Cinema at its best & the proof of Kurosawa's cinematic genius... An awesome plot & brilliant direction. Watch it just for the sheer pleasure that spectacular cinema can bring to u...Toshiro Mifune rocks!!!
1.0,rashomon,I agree that this is one of the top foreign films of the 20th century.
1.0,rashomon,"Story telling at its absolut best. 4 different versions of the truth. A rape, and a murder in the woods. Each version is an interesting look. It may not be Kurosawa's best but its a great film and had arguably the biggest impact in america of all japanese cinema."
1.0,rashomon,"The film is much less formally daring than its literary source, but its virtues are still plentiful: Kurosawa's visual style at its most muscular, rhythmically nuanced editing, and excellent performances"
1.0,rashomon,"Ver estas pelÃ­culas es como leer un poema, es puro arte. Ya quiero ver los Siete Samurais."
1.0,rashomon,Excellent film that really makes you think!
1.0,rashomon,uncut original version only...criterion for example!
1.0,rashomon,It is Akira Kurosawa do I really need to explain why this is an amazing film?
1.0,rashomon,Even those who aren't into Japanese film will enjoy this elegant masterpiece by Kurosawa. A crime is recounted from several conflicting points of view. Which is the truth? All and none. Reality lies between the stories.
1.0,rashomon,"Kurosawa's best. Can you ever trust anyone's memory, or yours?"
1.0,rashomon,My personal favorite of Kurosawa's works.
1.0,rashomon,"A classic. A story told from 4 different viewpoints. Great cinematography, performances, and dialogue."
1.0,rashomon,if u ask for most influential movie of previous century then rashamon will certainly get a thought.
1.0,rashomon,"Zapravo je odlican film. Odlican je i predlozak po kojem je napisan scenarij. Mislio sam mu dat manje jer ipak gluma nije tako uvjerljiva na zapadnjacki nacin, ali ipak sam na vrijeme odustao od te ideje. Film, naravno, izgleda prekrasno."
1.0,rashomon,"A really simple film with the same story told from different perspectives. I have seen this done in numerous films since, but none have been able to do it this well. The story was gripping, and working out the truth was impossible. Brilliant."
1.0,rashomon,Amazing.That's all. Amazing. See it.
1.0,rashomon,Storytelling doesn't get any better than this. Kurosawa's 'Rashomon' is a master in making the viewer question the truth. The character recaps are told through much creativeness.
1.0,rashomon,"So far, out of the handful of Kurosawa films I've seen, I might say that Rashomon is his most aesthetically pleasing film."
1.0,rashomon,"The villain. The bride. The deceased. The woodcutter. All with a story to tell, the ending no different in each case: a man dies, with the circumstances being lost to bias. \"
1.0,rashomon,Rashomon (1950) is still considered to be a puzzle/ a gimmick ... Explorers deeply the human psyche and IT SHOULD NOT BE MISSED !!
1.0,rashomon,"Thoughtful mediation on perception versus reality using a (then revolutionary) structure that's been tried many times since but ever bested. It's a masterfully made, nearly perfect film, with great sequences and terrific acting (even if Mifune's performance is too big)."
1.0,rashomon,"Good adaptation of 2 of Akutagawa Ryunosuke's short stories, Rashomon and In a Bamboo Grove. A must-read book and must-see movie. Maybe Toshiro Mifune's most aclaimed performance, along with Shichinin no Samurai."
1.0,rashomon,A masterpiece. The 2008 restored version is a must see!
1.0,rashomon,"A very deep film about morality, truth, the ugly side of human nature and eventually hope. Though some may think that Toshiro Mifune overacted his performance I thought it work well for the movie."
1.0,rashomon,Brilliant considering its time
1.0,rashomon,"One of the best Movies ever made, an amazing amusing Movie with great Actors about a Story who was telled by different Persons and they are according different again amazing from how much Views a Picture can be watched"
1.0,rashomon,[2009.07.31 on DVD] Absolutely Masterpiece!!
1.0,rashomon,The film that introduced Kurosawa to the west after the war. Mifune & Shimura are fantastic.
1.0,rashomon,A masterwork of nonlinear narrative.
1.0,rashomon,"Two guys sitting in the rain. There was 3 different version of a story of the same event. It was more about the selfishness and oppurtunistic nature of man. The monk almost loose hope towards humanity, yet a little shade of kindness in the end gave him back the hope he almost lost."
1.0,rashomon,"An insanely clever classic that keeps you guessing throughout the film. The story is told brilliantly from many different angles, ending with a logical conclusion."
1.0,rashomon,i wish I could give it more stars
1.0,rashomon,Perhaps the most ripped off story of the last 50 years. OF course that describes much of Kurasowa's canon. One of the greatest films from one of cinema's greatest directors.
0.0,rashomon,"Well, I was bored to tears. Apparently it's by some director who is supposed to be a genius and everyone is ripping off him, but if that were true - I wouldn't have enjoyed a movie ever. It's old, but that's no excuse for boring me to tears."

1.0,rashomon,My favorite movie of all time!!!! Five Stars is not enough.
1.0,rashomon,"A must-see. A storyline like nothing the west has ever done before, yet very westernized in the approach. A surprisingly taboo subject for the 1950's, a creepy ""medium,"" and a shocking ending that threw me for a loop. I couldn't understand how someone could possibly not enjoy this movie."
1.0,rashomon,Parang senate inquiry sa sex scandal!
1.0,rashomon,This doesn't quite top Throne of Blood as my favorite Kurosawa movie but it gets close. Really really close.
1.0,rashomon,"A beautiful inquisition into the nature of truth, hidden beneath a simple crime drama."
1.0,rashomon,A perfect movie from one of the world's greatest directors. And the rain! How cleansing!!
1.0,rashomon,"ã?¾ã??çµ?æ§?é?¢ç?½ã??ã?¨æ??ã??ã??ã??a good combo of rashomon and in a grove, as if those stories were ever meant to be combined. anyone who ventures to kyoto might want to check out sanmon if they want the feel for the movie."
1.0,rashomon,"Ah, now this one I can get into! Need to watch it again so I can write a more detailed review, but the idea behind it is great, and it had some parts that really floored me."
1.0,rashomon,The third best Kurosawa film.
0.0,rashomon,I missed the plot and pretty much all the other things in this film because I was too busy trying to stay awake..
1.0,rashomon,"A masterpeice of cinema, by Kurisawa. Toshiro Mufuni highlights this macabre tale of a crime as seen from several diferent points of view. Later inspired numerous films including Hero, and Vantage Point."
1.0,rashomon,"Dates amazingly well, the only 'distance' comes from culture and a theatrical style. As beautifully filmed, absorbing and thought provoking as its reputation."
1.0,rashomon,A classic piece of film.
1.0,rashomon,AWESOME AWESOME a great piece of art.
1.0,rashomon,Classic...Brilliant...
1.0,rashomon,"So this is what a classic looks like? Well, I already know... but yeah, it's amazing."
1.0,rashomon,Kurosawa's examination of truth pretty much proves that he can do no wrong.
1.0,rashomon,An amazing film classic that deals with the perception of truth. The film is beautiful in every aspect with strong characters and direction.
1.0,rashomon,The truth is in the eye of the beholder. More tributes have been made to this movie than possibly any other.
1.0,rashomon,"A classic detective movie!!!Offering some logical explanations for one case.This is a true detective movie.You'll see less act though. Well, you may say it's like a battle of logic."
1.0,rashomon,Awesome movie which tells the same story from multiple points of view. What actually did happen in the woods that day?
1.0,rashomon,This is a perfect movie.
1.0,rashomon,Classic murder mystery.
1.0,rashomon,"Ispirato a due racconti di Akunagawa, il film ha aperto una vera e propria stagione di scoperta del cinema orientale in Italia. Ancora oggi la visione Ã¨ godibile e rappresenta una sfida all'intelligenza e sensibilitÃ  di ogni spettatore! Le riprese della foresta sono indimenticabili."
1.0,rashomon,"I feel like this movie will influence me as a filmmaker a great deal. It really is a film for filmmakers, and covers some deep philosophical ground. I still think Ikiru is his best film, but this movie is still great."
1.0,rashomon,"Excellent movie... if you love movies, you have to see this. Great story, great directing, great everything. 'Truth' is a relative term when several different accounts of the same crime are not only different, but also logically incompatible."
1.0,rashomon,One of Kurosawa's early classic's where so many Directors have copied from. It will not be everyone's cup of tea it is what it is and it is one of Kurosawa's best.
1.0,rashomon,the best story all the time
1.0,rashomon,"There's a reason why Kurosawa got an Oscar for this film. A true journey into human nature and desires, it ends up that the lies told are worse than the actual crime. Absolutely brilliant."
1.0,rashomon,"The best of Kurosawa, and a great story told with passion and great images."
1.0,rashomon,"some very beautiful images in this, and the story itself left me with a great deal to think about. I also really liked the overacting, surprisingly."
1.0,rashomon,"One of the greatest films of all time. Between the stellar performances of Mifune, Shimura, and Machiko Kyo and Kazuo Miyagawa's brilliant cinematography this is one Kurosawa's finest."
1.0,rashomon,"The rain, the unquiet, the viciousness of humanity"
1.0,rashomon,the origianl non-linear samurai film noir
1.0,rashomon,"One of the best films ever made. Peircing examination of the unreliable narrator and spot on with cast, visuals and all else. It is my happy wish that everyone gets to see this movie at least once, it is just a real treat."
1.0,rashomon,"It's a brilliantly complicated piece of work that offers no clear answers, forcing the viewers to make up their own mind as to what it was that happened based on the self-serving testimony of the 4 people involved in the horrific incident in the woods."
1.0,rashomon,"After watching this movie, I still find myself asking what happened in those woods. If you learn anything, it's the complexity of the truth, memory, and human motive."
1.0,rashomon,"Brilliant directing by Akira Kurosawa! Wonderful story that brings up points of human nature, lies, and especially the powerful affect women have on men. Beautiful, and extremely symbolic. A must-see for hard-core movie lovers."
0.0,rebel_without_a_cause,"MAybe the worst movie I ever have seen, and the most overrated movie in america. it really shows the bad side of hollywood! the script sucks, directing is terrible and the acting is dull."
1.0,rebel_without_a_cause,Rebel Without a Cause earns its classic status with an unforgettable central performance from James Dean and a daring realism not seen in modern day coming of age (if you will) dramas.
1.0,rebel_without_a_cause,"I loved this movie. Incredible acting and moral ideas about teenagers, put into the film. Dean and Wood were super. Powerful and profound."
1.0,rebel_without_a_cause,It's the greatest teen movie that's ever been made.
1.0,rebel_without_a_cause,The best teen movie made.

1.0,rebel_without_a_cause,10 out of 10:A relatable film that is also well acted and written.
0.0,rebel_without_a_cause,"unrealistic, naive, full of stretches"
1.0,rebel_without_a_cause,"This film may seem a little flat at first glance, but with relatable characters, and a familiar premise, Rebel Without a Cause can be defined as the greatest ( and most iconic ) film centered around teenage angst and rebellion."

1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,Classic.. mere trenger man ikke Ã¥ si.. Fantastisk film..
0.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,"Great role for Alec Guinness and William Holden, who turn in typically strong performances. But the sheer length of this film drags itself into a miserable, dark hole."
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,"This is an amazing movie. Go watch it now, it has a timeless look is worth every damn 8 Oscars it won. Watch it and you'll understand why its one of the best movies ever. Plus its got Obi Wan as a bad ass in it."
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,One of the best movies ever made
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,"Another classic Sir David Lean epic. Besides brilliant script-writing about the cultural differences between parties, it celebrated the matter of 'principles' and a man's determination to uphold it. Nobility and graciousness of the trully remarkable Sir Alec Guinness shall never be forgotten!"
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,My dad told me that they built a replica of the bridge for kids to play on at the drive-in near where he grew up. It was built by the children of English POWs and then blown up to prevent model trains from traversing it.
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,"Too brilliant for a short review. Interesting take on how one perceives the psychology of Guinness' character Nicholson but more importantly, the way the climax was handled - just epic. Lean really dished us a masterpiece."
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,"This movie made me deeply think and question the validity of principles. I have never thought so much about a movie afterward. Extremely long, but the length is necessary for the payoff at the end."
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,Alec Guniness is INCREDIBLE
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,"An epic for all epics, this film will have you sweating by the time it's over. An incredible display of psychological fortitude from Guiness as he endures an unimaginable test of character. One of the coolest endings to a movie ever."
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,"Without a doubt the best ""British soldiers in a Japanese POW camp forced to build a bridge, staring Obi-Wan Kenobi"" movie I've ever seen!"
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,one of my favourite movies...Alec Guinness in his best interpretation...
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,Brilliant film and well worth a visit to see the real bridge and while your there sitting down with your ice cold coke think about those prisoners who worked everyday for up to 12 hours.
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,"What a great classic!, It's a truly gem!.-"
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,A classic in my book. Fairly true to the book with some glaring exceptions buta deserved winner of many awards.
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,"Amazing blockbuster from 1957, hasn't aged a bit. Holden and Hawkins excellent but it's Alec Guinness who really pulls it out...he's magnificent. Jack Hildyard's cinematography is sumptuous, shot in Sri Lanka."
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,"More Oscars than you can shake a stick at!! Alec Guinness plays a blinder as a bridge building POW. Seen it a million times, always a classic!"

1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,Best film ever. Just like Too Late the Hero but this film shows a dedication to the wrong cause where apathy was warranted not bravure and pride.
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,"a very story of leadership, obsession and conflict."
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,Alec Guinness before he was Obi-Wan Kenobi. Definitely one of my favorite WWII movies of all time.
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,"One of my favorite movies. Alec Guiness is Spot- on in his portrayal of Nicholson, a man with all the right intentions whose implementation of them becomes questionable."
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,"The beginning of the modern action film,its also one of the few intelligent action films.A classic in my top 10 favorite films of all time."

1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,An amazing example of what war movies used to be before Vietnam.
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,"I would say that David Lean couldn't top ""The Bridge on the River Kwai,"" but I'd be ignoring that other brilliant epic he made in 1962. I should probably see ""Doctor Zhivago,"" though."
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,So this is what perfection on a movie screen looks like!
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,"The phenomenal movie that guaranteed us our Obi-Wan Kenobi. Alec Guinness is superb and the plot, while slow, is riveting. I love this movie and can watch it over and over."

1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,"Alec Guiness, William Holden, Sessue Hayakawa, and Jack Hawkins are exceptional in this film. Beautifully shot and exquisite to look at. This might be one of the best war movies ever made...At the very least it's my favorite."
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,I watched this fantastic exploration on the nihilism of war for at least the fifteenth time this weekend. I still love it.
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,"stunning and perfect. it's about good intentions, what it means to be a leader, and how none of it matters a whip in the lunacy of war."

1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,Another great Holden film...
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,I don't know how I didn't see this movie. The ending fits perfectly with the theme of the whole movie and the bridge/building of the bridge becomes a tie which binds the characters together no matter the circumstance.  All for one and one for all?
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,"One of the finest moments in any film ever made is when Alec Guiness finally realizes what he's done. Good god, what an amazing moment!"

1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,"Great movie all around, the last scene is one of the best of all time. This is by far the best POW movie that I have ever seen or will ever see. Holden and Guinness put on two spetacular performances."
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,"Excellent! Lean, Guiness and Holden, everyone, are brilliant. Boys own adventure, and one of the best anti-war films you'll ever see."

1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,A war movie classic that really shows the growth of an obsession in a genuine way.
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,You could take away pretty much every English-language war movie ever made and we wouldn't lose anything as long as we still had this one.
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,"I saw this movie just yesterday and I think it is one of the best movies ever made, the acting is perfect, the directing, the locations, ... . The whole movie is just perfect. I liked the tensions between the colonel and the japanese warlord"

1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,GREAT movie. Alec and William were fantastic.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Malick's Badlands, while not 100% true to his later-developed style, is still a cerebral character analysis of the minds of two people in love who have lost their innocence but ultimately fail due to their youthfulness."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Perfectly combining two characters of either sadistic, egocentric, or emotionally distant personalities, Badlands blends together a tight execution with a glorious poetic delivery."
0.0,1001577-badlands,"I can't believe the high ratings by some peopleI have seen hundreds of top movies of all kindsThis is one mindless, horrible script of a movieThe violence makes no sense AndHow did Martin Sheen become the greatest shot in the world?Does anyone else care about that?Complete waste of time!!"
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Simply one of the richest, most intriguing films in the American cinematic canon."
1.0,1001577-badlands,What a gem! Stumbled across this film last night and couldn't stop watching. Def. a must see.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"A very American debut from Malick, repressed, gorgeous, and quietly philosophical."
1.0,1001577-badlands,Sheen and Spacek were unknown at the time and this was Malick's debut so it was overlooked. They're finally catching on.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"It has quickly become one of my favorite movies of all time. Brilliant performances, steady directing, beautiful cinematography and a great score. Surprisingly funny thanks in large part to Martin Sheen's droll wit in the part of the sociopath Kit."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"A young Midwestern couple go on a senseless killing spree. A hauntingly poetic debut rife with violence, love, & beauty."
1.0,1001577-badlands,The brilliant debut of Terence Malick is measured like a beautiful poem and chock full of sumptuous visuals. 'Badlands' is an impressionistic dream of a film.
1.0,1001577-badlands,A film about nihilism. A film about hate and love.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Incredible. Great story told in unbelievable fashion.
1.0,1001577-badlands,This movie was beautiful in every aspect; a visual poem of the death of freedom.
1.0,1001577-badlands,The ending sums up everything.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Wow. Finally saw this and understand the fuss about Terrence Malik - and Martin Sheen as well. Masterful.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"I mean, come on. It's Terrence Malick."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"I basically love all things Malick. This isn't my favorite amongst his movies, but it' still pretty spectacular."
1.0,1001577-badlands,One of my all time favorites.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Obra máxima de Malick, onde tudo funciona e tem em seu elenco sua maior força."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Fantastic. It is a dreamlike tale of murder, blind love, and the desire to escape. Malick is a truly masterful filmmaker."
0.0,1001577-badlands,"This turns an ugly spate of serial killings into a rhinestone cowboy, ready the real story to see how ugly the murders were... joke.."
1.0,1001577-badlands,So disturbing yet beautiful at the same time. A true American masterpiece.
1.0,1001577-badlands,So Spare & Poetic it chills you to the bone
1.0,1001577-badlands,Terrence Malick's best film. Cinematographic masterpiece of a cowboy brand James Dean running from the law with a girl far too young for any good. Loved it
1.0,1001577-badlands,"The greatest debut film since Citizen Kane. Malick transcends the genres this film milks to create a statement about America that few dared to enunciate. The emptiness of the landscapes, the self-lies and movie-derived self-images haunt the viewer."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Badlands is really that good; beautifully constructed, impeccably script, but for the film buffs, it is the perfect film about a serial killer on the run for the American Dream."
1.0,1001577-badlands,A masterpiece with unique moments of transcendence and horrifying beauty as well as an excellent Martin Sheen and a perfect and natural Sissy Spacek who enlightens the screen with her vibrant honesty.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Terrance Malick's AUDACIOUS debut!! Film as art!
1.0,1001577-badlands,"A beautifully shot tale of murder, angst, individualism and a white t shirt that just never gets dirty no matter what is thrown at it."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Excellent Bonnie and Clyde style movie by Terrence Malik. I'm yet to see a stinker by this guy. Fabulous vacuous and wastelandish scenery. As the death tolls keep on mountain, so does the gripping tension. Martin Sheen was fantastic as the cool laid back Kit"
1.0,1001577-badlands,A strangely poignant and hypnotic film.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Few filmmakers can carve their own cult and call it art in Hollywood. Terrence Malick is one of those filmmakers.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Badlands is Moonrise Kingdom with bloodshed not strictly limited to dogs.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"What an incredible debut from Malick. Still as fresh and beautiful today, especially in the gorgeous new criterion transfer. This is his best film, a masterpiece on all levels."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Malick's first film venture is my personal favorite, because its the least Malicky one of the lot. This is because a narrative is present, and he actually cares about the performances here. A delightful little crime saga of two teenagers on the run from the law."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Remarkable debut - Malick sprang forth fully formed, like Venus from the sea. His trademarks are in place: gorgeous, naturally lit cinematography and day-to-day actions set against vast landscapes. This is finally being released on Blu-ray by Criterion!"
1.0,1001577-badlands,"When pared down a bit, Badlands can be described as a road movie. Since the main characters and where they go are the most important aspects of most such films, and Malick's lead actors both give great performances, Badlands works on many levels."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Malick's first movie may not be as challenging or arresting as some of his later work, but Badlands still gave me a taste of pure cinematic poetry."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Malick's debut is still one of the greatest films in existence, there's really nothing more I can say about it without writing pages upon pages of praise. If you haven't seen it, watch it, then watch it again."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Badlands is a stellar work of American filmmaking, packed with the visual beauty and dignified performances that would distinguish the films of director Terrence Malick."

1.0,1001577-badlands,One of Terrence Malick's best :-)
1.0,1001577-badlands,Wow. No other words are needed.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Probabaly my favorite Malick flick
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Malick's vision is superb, from the opening scene to the closing scene it is a work of art and beautifully made. Spacek and Sheen's partnership is amazing and the film is amazing from start to finish"
1.0,1001577-badlands,"This insight into the surreal world of a psychopathic killer & his ""simple-minded"" teenage girlfriend is IMHO one of the finest films I've ever seen.It is, compelling, poetic, beautiful, haunting yet eerily unsettling on many levels.An extraordinary film."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Brilliant film, another piece of evidence that the best movies were made in the 70s"
1.0,1001577-badlands,"The most complete movie, never that and never more."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Perhaps one of the best films ever made. Its wonderfully acted and beautifully photographed but its Malick's cooly detached direction that brings all the pieces together and makes it powerful and unforgettable,"

1.0,1001577-badlands,I've been wanting to see this for years and finally got around to it. As beautiful a film about a serial killer and his underage girlfriend on a road trip as you'll ever see.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"It's aimless, directionless, remorseless nature not only serves as wonderful style, but real thoughtfulness."
1.0,1001577-badlands,This may be the strongest debut feature I've seen since CITIZEN KANE. It's perfect.
1.0,1001577-badlands,A fantastic film! Malick's debut is one of the best films of the seventies and gave us a glimpse at his future film making!
1.0,1001577-badlands,this movie was terrfic even though i just got done watching it i think that this is one of the amazing films i have ever seen so far it is my 2nd fav malick film but it amazing the netire way though martin sheen was amazing and overall this is a terrence malick masterpecie!!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Another masterpiece from the best decade for American cinema featuring amazing performances (Sissy Spacek, I'll always have a soft spot for you)."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Poetic, obscure and very watchable. The violence is brazen, very much like it would be in life, and much of the photography is unexpected. Sheen and Spacek are remarkably likable; Malick's debut comes across as the Mean Streets of the midwest, but softer."
0.0,1001577-badlands,Terrible. Nonsensical. Pretty scenery but not good.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Impossible to find a single flaw with this film. Every aspect, from the script to the cinematography, is beautiful."

1.0,1001577-badlands,Clever account of Joe Starkweahter's '50's Dakota crime spree with that crazy Fugate girl. Marin Sheen and Sissy Spacek in their best roles.
1.0,1001577-badlands,One of the weirdest movie I've ever seen. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing! A work of art.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Great on so many levels! Terrence Malick is a force to be reckoned with.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Na falação de Malick para Cannes, resolvi assistir a obra do autor, do início; filme muito bom; em todos os aspectos;"
1.0,1001577-badlands,An interesting based on true story. Martin and Sissy rule.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Eminently watchable. Martin Sheen has a magnetic screen presence and at only 90 minutes the film is just perfect. It's also a hell of a good looking film but that goes without saying for a Terrence Malick picture.Fantastic.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"One of the most bizarre films I've ever seen, with a tone that not only has never been reproduced ever, but is almost unexplainable. There is an eerieness to the cluelessness of the two protagonists that is completely strange but totally fascinating at the same time."
1.0,1001577-badlands,Flixter users are stupid.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"An awesome movie, with beautiful cinematography, great directing, writing and acting!"

1.0,1001577-badlands,terence malick is the shit
1.0,1001577-badlands,This is the first Sheen film i've seen but i'd go as far to say that this is likely his best role to date. Badlands is a real-life inspired film about a trigger-happy Sheen which is a very original take on the norm of serial killer features.
0.0,1001577-badlands,not much happened. meh
1.0,1001577-badlands,One of the greatest movies ever
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Sissi Spacek's voice is as sweet as a bird, Martin Sheen's actions are as scary as the devil himself."
1.0,1001577-badlands,Great movie. Sheen is cunningly likable while being psychotic. The movie rides the line of tragedy and beauty. American Beauty could be characterized as a modern equivalent of this film. Badlands is a must see.
1.0,1001577-badlands,fantastic! where has this movie been all my life?
1.0,1001577-badlands,Great film and music
1.0,1001577-badlands,Just absolutely stunning. Terence Malick's poetic visuals and career-best work from Martin Sheen. Great film.

1.0,1001577-badlands,Arguably the best feature film debut EVER. The sets & cinematography are so inspired & beautiful. The performances are amazing. Even the iffy parts of the script work because they indeed make Badlands what it is.
1.0,1001577-badlands,An instant favorite!
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Una película excelente, con la música de Carl Orff ""Música Poética"", con una historia parecida a Bonny and Clyde, pero incluso más cruda. En español se llama Malas Tierras."

1.0,1001577-badlands,"Malick is my favourite director, and this was his first film, and one of the best debuts by a director, I think. Classic American angst story of a young couple fleeing the law and the American society in the fifties midwest."

1.0,1001577-badlands,"Martin Sheen plays a guy who falls in love with a fifteen year old girl (played by Sissy Spacek) and after murdering her father, the two of them go on a cross country murder spree.

1.0,1001577-badlands,"Best use of voice over in a film, ever."
1.0,1001577-badlands,I hope my debut can come as close to artful poetry as this film. The frames are so wide and the writing is so wonderful that this movie pushes into the realm of literature.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"What will it take to start seeing American cinema like this again? This travel narrative tears apart the fairy tale of the home, romance, and nature. Flawless!"
1.0,1001577-badlands,A quietly beautiful film. Malick's approach to following Kit and Holly without judgement is relaxing for me in an off-putting way.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"In terms of its cinematic beauty, the script's ability to maneuver through the adept usage of humor, action, romance, and suspense, it's everything that Bonnie & Clyde wished it could be, and then some."

1.0,1001577-badlands,"Historically accurate, a rare quality in American films."
1.0,1001577-badlands,Terrence Malick pulls something so new out of a story so old. You'll have to see it to make your own decisions but there is something so beautiful in the innocence of these two characters on screen that even when they do horrible things you can't help but smile.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Martin Sheen is so charming and perfect in this film, I'd let him kill me."
1.0,1001577-badlands,Tää on kyllä yks parhaita ikinä!!
1.0,1001577-badlands,"An amazing cinematic experience. Martin Sheen is great in this career defining role that pegs him as the 70s James Dean, and Sissy Spacek is even better as his naive girlfriend. Probably the most interesting couple-crime movie since Bonnie and Clyde."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"This is Malick at his best. Often copied (True Romance) but never matched. This is an American classic, not to be missed!"
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Every aspect of this movie is wonderful -- the script, the cinematography, the acting. Disturbing and likable. How does that happen?"

1.0,1001577-badlands,"Awesome, gets better every time you see it."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"how did I not review this yet? This movie's awesome - probably not quite as beautiful as Days of Heaven, but with consistently better performances and with just as potent a love story in the center of it. Few serial killer flicks are like it."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"The Best Terence Malick film. Better than ""The Days of Heaven""."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"The unique, lilting music would subsequently crop up in True Romance, though Tarantinoâ??s generation has yet to dethrone Badlands as the most haunting of all couple-on-the-run movies."
1.0,1001577-badlands,Even better on the big screen...Martin Sheen makes a great serial killer
1.0,1001577-badlands,I've pretty much watched Malick's films backwards.

1.0,1001577-badlands,"I'm kind of working my way around his four movies. This was the only one I had seen, sadly. Thought once again it was amazing. I just love the way this guy thinks. Hope Criterion picks this one up."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Fabulous film, wonder how many people see the new 'Oasis' soft drink ad and think 'badlands'?"
1.0,1001577-badlands,"""Instead I sat in the car and read a map, and spelled out entire sentences with my tongue on the roof of my mouth where nobody could read 'em."" Hands down, my favorite film of all time."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"The origins of Terrence Malick's genius are spawned here in this powerful, haunting and bold debut."

1.0,1001577-badlands,It doesn't get better than this.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Finally saw this. Wow, what a film. And I thought that score from 'True Romance' was so unique at the time - they totally ripped it off from this movie! (Perhaps it was in homage as the storylines have parallels)."
1.0,1001577-badlands,This is just about the best movie I have ever seen. No lie
1.0,1001577-badlands,"haunting movie, theres nothing like it and a great score endlessly ripped off..."

1.0,1001577-badlands,"El director Terrence Malick solo ha hecho 4 cintas y todas son espectaculares... Escojo a ""Badlands"" por ser la mas oscura de las 4 y porque deja en la verguenza a ""Natural Born Killers""."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"I can't fault this film on any level.From the story, based on fact, (Charles Starkweather),acting,costume,music.etc Terrence Malick is a brilliant director."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"comment rendre l'horreur sublime, au delÃ  du fait divers une ode Ã  l anature comme seul terrence le grand peut en faire. Un film qui se regarde sur grand Ã©cran et qui malheureuselement (ou heureusement) ne passe pas le petit Ã©cran."
1.0,1001577-badlands,Martin Sheen's best role...that I've seen (including Apocalypse Now).My only criticism: there were a few moments where the music was kind of cheesy. I think it must have been the James Taylor contributions: generic 70's.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Seriously, the most imitated film in cinematic history. I still love it though."
1.0,1001577-badlands,Gorgeous yet unsettling.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Beautifully directed, subtle acting, and STUNNING cinematography. An emotionally gripping take on the Charles Starkweather-Caril Ann Fugate killings. This is what ""Natural Born Killers"" tried to do, but FAILED."
1.0,1001577-badlands,Terrence Malick is a visual poet.
1.0,1001577-badlands,A film of cinematic poetry.
1.0,1001577-badlands,amazing film! sissy is the best!
1.0,1001577-badlands,malick appears on the scene fully formed in style. at 90~ minutes much tighter in pacing than his more recent movies which maybe heightens the juxtaposition of ambiguous visuals and revealing narration.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Still one of the greatest American films of all time.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Sheen's ""Kit"" is as much a ""walking contradiction"" as Deniro's later ""Travis Bickle"" would be, and both films are far funnier than they get credit for."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Wow I haven't watched this one in years, but a stunning movie. Great acting, cinematography, directing, script etc. etc."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"""Sometimes I wished he'd fall into the river and drown, just so I could watch."""
1.0,1001577-badlands,The more I see it the more I think this is one of the best movies of all times. Perfect in all aspects. The intro always gives me chills.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Beautiful photography and great performances throughout from Sheen and Spacek. Great music, great atmosphere. Love love it."
1.0,1001577-badlands,I think it says volumes that all of this movie's many imitators have missed the mark so dramatically.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Banal murder is the scariest kind
1.0,1001577-badlands,Quintessential Malick. And by this I mean that this movie is very orange.

1.0,1001577-badlands,"This film is horrifying, haunting, and indescribable. If I taught film, this would be a must see. I feel like I understand a little more about everything. There are no answers in this film, just various and subtle truths about its characters."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Terrance Mallick's Empty, Yet Beautifal 'Badlands'. Fantastic."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Rich and full of deep, astounding images (as always with Malick) that will burn in your mind, and leave you haunted with dark, unanswerable questions."
1.0,1001577-badlands,The essential tragic American Romance. Voice over is very effective. Cinematography is breathtaking. Captures something quintessentially American.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"The pace is slow, which can seems strange at first for a movie about a couple running away, but it totally fits and the outstanding cinematography add a desolation atmosphere to the pessimistic storyline."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"A daring masterpiece of cinema, an update of Rebel Without a Cause for the next generation of lost souls who felt out of touch with the world."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"One of the best movies I've ever seen. Seriously. Kind of hilarious, too."
1.0,1001577-badlands,As good as an American film can aspire to be.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"The first Malick masterpiece. As ""referenced"" in Tarantino's True Romance and a thousand other films. Shocking and tender in equal measure."
1.0,1001577-badlands,Terence Malick's debut is a beautifully-shot examination of two lovers who roam the American prairie as Sheen quietly (and politely) kills people.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Spacek was around 23
1.0,1001577-badlands,"""I wish they make a Special edition DVD of this one day. One of the best movies ever made, a ladmark achivement for Terrence Malick, and a star-making performance by Martin Sheen"""
1.0,1001577-badlands,This film is beautiful.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Terry Mallick's first direction; Sissy Spacek & Martin Sheen's first film. Sparse, fast and unforgettable."

1.0,1001577-badlands,Just stunningly beautiful.
1.0,1001577-badlands,What a haunting and poetic film. Amazingly shot over the badlands where the sky and plains stretch on forever. A great picture. Wish Warren Oates had been used a bit more though
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Terrence Malick's debut pictures the fragility of innocence, thin line between good and evil and the haphazard nature of life. The light, the settings, the rythm and the actors are great."
1.0,1001577-badlands,This is my favorite film of all time. In my opinion its Martin Sheen at his best and Sissy Spacek is brilliant too. Its a great film!
1.0,1001577-badlands,greaaatttttttt really beautiful shots
1.0,1001577-badlands,Ooit op een nacht op televisie gezien. Terrence Malick is een echte kunstenaar. Ofwel ben je helemaal voor ofwel helemaal tegen dit soort film. Buitenaards mooie sfeer.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Just beautiful, loved the burning house shoot"
1.0,1001577-badlands,A master piece that has been homaged over and over. A pure work of genius. The cinematography serves to compliment the sublime understated performances of Martin Sheen and Sissey Spacek.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Who said that Sissy Spacek wasn't ever sexy and that treehouses weren't for adults? Martin Sheen's best performance.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"this is my favorite movie. i could maybe only watch this movie for the rest of my life. really, i only watch other movies so people think i'm a good film major"

1.0,1001577-badlands,Leccion de como hacer una buena pelicula
1.0,1001577-badlands,"A Terrence Mallick tour de force. Martin Sheen as a James Dean imitator, Sissy Spacek another quitessentially strange sociopathic teen and of course the only cameo of the director you'll ever see. A dark journey into the dark heart of America with a killing spree leading into the badlands."
1.0,1001577-badlands,One of the best American heartland films ever!!!!!!!
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Regardless of whether you're male, female, or hermaphrodite, gay, straight, or bi, you'll fantasize about *licking off every last one of Sissy Spacek's freckles.*If you're into BDSM, please read biting in place of licking."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Gorgeous, bleak American landscapes, wonderfully photographed, provide the perfect backdrop for this tale of American morality and amorality. Sissy Spacek's vacant detachment is a perfect foil for Martin Sheen's doomed implosive rage. Best watched on a big screen, but will never disappoint."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"performances in this film are just so good, and the music makes it just wonderful to watch"
1.0,1001577-badlands,a young Martin Sheen shows that Charlie looks like a cloan of his Dad. Sissy does a great job as a naive kid who ends up on a dangerous path. Martin Sheen was and is a great lead actor. He commands your attention.
1.0,1001577-badlands,This is the movie that i watch over and over.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Aimless kids in love end up going on a murder and robbery spree in the 50s. Great performances by Sheen and Spacek on a very styled and atmospheric direction by Terrence Malick. A classic.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Terrence Malick has in his career to date only made three films. In over thirty years. However every one is worth watching and there aren't many directors you can say that about. Badlands is sublime.

1.0,1013775-metropolis,"I couldn't stop watching out of amazement. Fritz Lang's silent epic received little recognition for its achievements upon original release, which goes to show that the greatest works of art take time to be truly appreciated."

1.0,1013775-metropolis,The work on remaking this movie while keeping the intent of the original piece was done very well. The inserted script panels to help explain the story were meant to lend a more coherent plot to the story. I liked it very much and it remains one of my favorite movies of all time.
1.0,1013775-metropolis,"For a good reason, I have never seen any other edits of Metropolis except for (luckily) the new restoration. However, I don't feel that even words can describe how awesome it is. The point is, only see the 2010 restoration, and if you can, see it on the big screen. I know I did."
1.0,1013775-metropolis,"The recently restored version is a winner, so many of the restored scenes helped you bond with the characters, they're no longer mysteries, they have motivation."
1.0,1013775-metropolis,"A real and true classic. The acting style is old-fashioned, the politics kind of simplistic, but it's all good thanks to Lang's great sense of style and dizzying set pieces. Oh, and the 210-minute cut was recently found!"

1.0,1013775-metropolis,"Otrolig film! Tänk att den gjordes sisådär 75 år innan ""sagan om ringen""-trilogin, men ändå känns imponerande storslagen. Särskilt scenerna som visar arbetarnas slit och alienation är superba. Att skådespeleriet tidvis är överdrivet får man väl leva med i en stumfilm."
1.0,1013775-metropolis,"Classic science fiction. Too bad some parts were lost from the physical degradation of the film. Warning this is a silent film, so all the dialog is presented between shots."
1.0,1013775-metropolis,especially the 1985 Giorgio Moroder version
1.0,1013775-metropolis,One of the most influential films of all time. This silent classic is way before its time.
1.0,1013775-metropolis,It's hard to believe this film was made when it was. You really do need to see it to understand why it's heralded as being such a powerful landmark in cinema. You have never seen any like it before and you're not likely to see anything like it ever again.
1.0,1013775-metropolis,"It is single handedly THE most awe-inspiring silent motion picture I have ever seen. You have to get the restored authorized version that is close to Fritz Lang's version. Tragically, some of the footage was destroyed, but they fill in the empty spaces for you."
1.0,1013775-metropolis,Possibly the farthest anything has been beyond its time.

1.0,mean_streets,"Movie about a group of young friends (or maybe thugs?) who like having a good time together. Takes the gangster movies from the golden age and kicks it up a notch. More violence, language, and sex. But Scorsese adds religion too making it even more realistic. One of the best ever."

1.0,mean_streets,"Gritty and real feel, stellar script, great cinematography, and breakthrough performances -- a classic piece of cinema."
1.0,mean_streets,"A simple story presented in Scorsese's early-trademark style. This dark, murky and gritty tale gives history on what Little Italy once was and does not fall short on realism and great performances by the young veteran actors of Keital and De Niro."
1.0,mean_streets,Scorsese's first great film. Nothing else needs to be said.
1.0,mean_streets,""" You don't make up your sins in church. You do it on the streets. You do it at home. The rest is bullshit and you know it."" This film is a classic. Couldn't love it more.

1.0,mean_streets,Intense tale with fantastic performances from Keitel and DeNiro.
1.0,mean_streets,"One of the few ""New Hollywood"" films I like, this masterpiece holds up perfectly today. Lays the groundwork for everything that came after in the gangster genre, from Pulp Fiction to Scorsese's own Goodfellas. Robert De Niro's first stunningly brilliant performance."
1.0,mean_streets,"Martin Scorsese's strong tale about the corruption and morality of the street is an early indicator of his significant cinematic talents, as well as including exhilarating performances from Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel."

1.0,mean_streets,One of the most realistic movies of the generation.
0.0,mean_streets,"Just didn't do it for me. It's a lot of ""Hey we're New York Italians and we're cool."", but no storyline that truly grabs me. Some scenes are quite funny and well-done; however it fails as a cohesive unit."
1.0,mean_streets,A wonderful film done by a real genius of cinema that is Martin Scorsese. 5/5
1.0,mean_streets,"Martin Scorsese burst onto the scene with this electrifying drama about moral and spiritual uncertainty. Powerfully directed and outstandingly performed, Mean Streets set the bar for gritty crime dramas and inspired many films to come from the likes of Quentin Tarantino."

1.0,mean_streets,"I'll never know,How Robert De Niro and Harvey Keitel never got an oscar for this?? Scorsese stamps his trademark in Hollywood with this spectacular film."
1.0,mean_streets,"Scorsese's most underrated movie. A bit dated, but still incredibly well-done."
1.0,mean_streets,"One of the best films of the 70s. De Niro gets the flashy role here, but it's Harvey Keitel who's the heart and soul of Mean Streets."
1.0,mean_streets,Classic !Start of an era of pillars.
1.0,mean_streets,Incredible. I ponder if this De Niro's best performance-joint 'Taxi Driver' and 'The King Of Comedy' due to it being so unlike anything he's done since (excluding the aforementioned).
1.0,mean_streets,"La primer gran joya en la carrear de Martin Scorsese, una cinta bien ejecutada, bien lograda y que plasma la esencia violenta y cruda de new york de una manera grandiosa."
1.0,mean_streets,A cinema changing masterpiece.
1.0,mean_streets,The simplistic way Scorsese approaches the grit of Mean Streets & the complexity of Charlie's inner demons results in the creation of a truly authentic masterpiece. Ranks among my favorite movies of all time.
1.0,mean_streets,One of the first visually striking Scorsese crime film featuring underrated performances by a young Harvey Keitel and Robert De Niro (the first with his collaboration with Scorsese).
1.0,mean_streets,"This contains my favourite De Niro performance, and one of my favourite of Keitel's. Should be renamed ""A Day in the Life of a Wise Guy""."

1.0,mean_streets,"GOOD MOVIE, SAD, BUT GOOD..."
1.0,mean_streets,"One of Scorsese's first films that is a true classic and tells a great story of the mid-20th century Little Italy. The actors give great performances as well. And after seeing this film, now I can tell why Robert De Niro was chosing to play Travis in Taxi Driver."

1.0,mean_streets,Harvey Keitel and Robert DeNiro are oustanding. The conclusion is one of Scorsese's most devastating.

1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"Excellent dialogue, action, photography, and especially acting notably with Lancaster and Curtis. A fantastic film that is not talked about enough. Sharp, witty, and perfectly paced this is a classic film that really deserved Academy notice back in '57. A great film."

1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,(Watched Fri 25 June 2010) Tony Curtis was never better. And that dialogue!
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"Great movie. Endlessly cynical, and the killer dialogues could make anyone's day. Burt Lancaster should have won an oscar for his brilliant performance as the seedy, malevolent J.J. Hunsecker. And Tony Curtis is a tour de force on his own.I think I can watch this movie again and again."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"""You're dead, son. Get yourself buried."""
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,Beautiful texture which reminded me a little of Touch of Evil. Similar time I guess. Burt Lancaster is outstanding in his controlled aggression.
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"They don't make 'em like they used to. A remarkable, unsentimental drama shot in glorious black and white. The editing is also very fine and what a great cast!"
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"You know more and care more about no less than ten different characters in the first forty minutes of this movie than most current movies can manage in their entire running time. Brilliantly written, directed, and performed. A true classic."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis in this movie are the epitome of sinisterness, slime, and sleaziness in a hard-boiled drama that can only be called a classic!"
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,Burt Lancaster's J J Hunsecker is one of the great cinematic villains
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"A cut-throat game of revenge and ambition! Set in the back-stabbing world of print tabloid journalism in NYC! And with amazing, probably career-best performances by Burt Lancaster, Tony Curtis, and the almost movie-stealing Barbara Nichols. I loved it! I would put t up there in my favorites!"
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"This is my type of film. The two main characters are downright despicable. Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis are both amazing in this film. Though, the real star for me was the cinematography. This film shot New York better than any film I have ever seen around the time period. Just an amazing film"
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"Extremely great film. Excellent sharp and witty dialogue. Lancaster and Curtis give intense performances as two evil, backstabbing, sleazy SOBs"
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"The matching of J.J. Hunsecker (Lancaster) and Sidney Falco (Curtis) is pure dynamite, an exciting no- holds- barred ride of a film."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"If you haven't seen this, you should."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"Like Casablanca, this is one of the great classics that even someone ""not into black and white films"" will love. The dialogue, performance, story, and cinematography are all legendary. Watch it already!!"
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,Tony Curtis is great in this surprisingly dark tale about the underworld of New York's gossip collumnists and press agents. The film features some stunning black and white photography and is very much an oft overlooked classic.
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"'Cat's in the bag and the bag's in the river.Just a flat terrible movie, but it pulses rhythmically like the beat of a drum and grows on you because of that hip, street wise dialogue you only wish you had the literate wit to say in normal conversation."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"The plot has its twists and turns, but where this film really grabbed me was in its witty dialogue and wonderful performances, especially main man Tony Curtis.Grade: A / Views: 1"
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,Absolutely brilliant.
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"Before America took capitalism for granted these guys ""looked"" bad. So it's kind of like normal assholes portrayed to look like vampires or deranged zealots. Hitchcock couldn't have made these jerks any more creepy."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"A wonderfully cool, stylish movie that dissects the sleazy world of PR and gossip masquerading as journalism. Tony Curtis is remarkable as the desperate PR guy, hungry for success and losing everything that matters as he chases it."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,LURVE Burt Lancaster
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,one of my all time favorites. Burt Lancaster rocks!

1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,Burt Lancaster y Tony Curtis ofrecen unas interpretaciones devastadoras en este negro relato sobre la codicia y el deseo.
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,A great film. An intense drama superbly acted and nicely made. Tony Curtis is excellent but this is Lancaster's film. His performance is one of the all time greats - a brilliant fusion of ego and menace.
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"Every single character in this nightcrawling noir masterpiece is tainted, corrupted and compromised. Add Clifford Odets' and Ernest Lehmann's poetry-of-malice dialog and James Wong Howe's photography and it achieves a rancid perfection."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"A film noir that proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that humans of all types, not just criminals and gangsters, can be full of malice, deceit and a smooth, serpentine evil. Scary."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,Just a masterpiece. One of the tightest and sharpest scripts I've ever come across.
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,this is a movie with modern sensibilities beyond its age. strong characters and an unremorsfull plot makes this a truly vintage piece of cinema
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"Autre chef-d'oeuvre de violence psychologique, et critique impitoyable des mÃ©dias, le tout dans un monde oÃ¹ tout est corrompu et sordide, ""Sweet Smell"" a des allures de tragÃ©dies greques, avec un arriÃ¨re-plan d'inceste assez courageux pour l'Ã©poque. ""Match me, Sidney""."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"They simply do not make 'em like this any more. Razor sharp dialogue, perfectly delivered performances -- the kind of film Network, Wall Street and Boiler Room could only hope to aspire to, but never match."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,What could be better than seeing that irritating cop from Adam 12 framed for smoking the devil weed? Just kidding...this is the best movie of all time.
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"Excellent film-noir without guns, reminded me of Night and the City with its quick pace largely dialog-based conflict. Also, pretty clear commentary on McCarthyism."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,a razor blade of cynicism and human nature at it's worst...

1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"Oy, this is a nasty film. If you think humanity is the shit, watch this to cure what ails you. If he were alive, I would want to meet Burt Lancaster, except he scares me."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"I LOVE this movie - dialogue is fantastic, look is all noir, the weird unspoken unconsumated incestuousness on Hunsecker's part in a 50's movie, all the evil motivations of the people, & probably the best performance of Tony Curtis' life."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"Tony Curtis is amazing in this movie; the cinematography is beautiful; the Jazz angle is silly but WOW, what a movie"

1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,It only gets better with every viewing. One of the darkest scripts ever to surface.
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"When it comes to noir, here's the most venomous of them all. Lancaster and Curtis go head-to-head spewing acid like it's going out of style. It pulls no punches, hits about as hard as Ace in the Hole, and features one of the most brilliant scripts in film history."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"Stayed good, stayed sharp, stayed brutal, didn't stay staid."

1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"Unfortunately, I've yet to come across a situation in my own life where ""Match me, Sydney"" would be both germane and pants-wettingly scary. Also, this movie is weirdly all about race without ever mentioning it."

1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,Some of the best dialogue ever written.
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"This acerbic and sharp-tongued film noir fills no punches. Burt Lancaster as the newspaper columnist who can make or break careers, and Tony Curtis as his sniveling helper are both extremely quotable."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,Film Nior and the dark side of Hollywood.This film was roughly based on Walter Winchell. It is seedy as it gets in a fifties movie and goes one better than LA Cofidential.

1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,Maybe the best dialogue film of all time.
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,One of the best movies ever made. J.J. Hunsecker is one of the ickiest people ever.
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"Sweet Smell of Success delivers a very important message: Powerful people will do anything to suppress the truth and in a dirty city, being good is being stupid. The peculiar bond between J.J and Falco makes us love this movie."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,I got to see this in a screenwriting class and now I own it. It's a rare gem and is as badass as any movie today without using a million f-words.
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"One of my favorite works of noir. I really enjoy the stark potrayl of New York and show buisness which is usally just seen in musicals during this period. Really enjoyed everyone (Curtis, Lancaster...) especially Martin Milner in a pre Jack Webb role."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,Hoo hoo! Burt Lancaster is soooo badassed in this!

1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"A masterpiece of the silent era, this is a simple story told to devastating effect, mainly by the expressions on the face of Falconetti and to a lesser extent by the expressions of all the other actors.

1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,This movie was really great! Her eyes really spoke to me and made me feel the suspense. It's amazing to think that this movie was made in the 1920s with all of the good editing and camera usage.
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,The most beautiful film I've ever seen. Maria Falconetti turns in a heartbreaking performance of profound love and faith as well as the inevitability of her death.
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,Closeup city. Now I know where those cliches of European art films as closeup marathons come from. This is ridiculously well shot. Wonderful to look at. And that score...
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,The beauty of this movie is simply indescribable. Each close-up - which each scene is filled with - expresses the characters emotions more than anything. There is simply no need for dialoges as the characters' faces speak for themselves.
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"A great silent movie, but i did watch it in a special event, with music by a British group named ""The Nursery"". A superb experience."
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"Just watched this in the theatre with a live orchestra, what an amazing experience!This movie jumped onto my top ten list after just one viewing, I've watched it several times now. Possibly my fave silent film."
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"Dreyer's revolutionary, awe-inspiring magnum opus broke boundaries with its powerful camera stylistics and a moving performance by lead Falconetti. Its message has seemingly richened with age, undoubtedly one of the most influential films in cinematic history."

1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"Probably more striking today than in 1928 since we've had 80 more years of film history since then, and there still isn't (to my knowledge) a movie that visually looks quite like this..."
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,Forget Bette Davis eyes. Falconetti eyes are truly windows to the soul.
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"amazing for a silent movie and 20's standard, this is what i called the true timeless classic film, and falconetti performance is surely without the slightest doubt is the best female performance in a film that i have ever seen.."

1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"Best film ever made in my opinion. i cannot do justice to it with my very limited written review skills. See it, fell it, rembember it.   p.s. what retard gave this film a splat?"
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"Based on the trial transcript and featuring Maria Falconetti playing Joan with all the religious agony and ecstasy usually reserved for icons and statues, this string of gloriously shot close ups (dominantly) is totally bitchin'!"

1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,A devastating masterpiece
0.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,114 minutes of an exceptionally unattractive individual screaming and crying in extreme detail failed to convey any meaningful message.
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"Well, hot damn, this movie's pretty incredible. Cinematography=win. Powerful and moving acting by Falconetti. The camerawork, and the inclusion of Voices of Light (which I feel only adds to the film's power) really make for some compelling filmmaking, worthy of multiple viewings.A must-see."
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,It rarely gets better than this.
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"This movie is perfect...and Richard Einhorn's Voices of Light just makes is better, if that is even possible! Joan of Arc is a spiritually significant film, where art and faith meet."

1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"This movie holds up incredibly well for being eighty years old and silent. The film is intensely claustrophobic, since it is almost entirely shot in closeups. Easily in the top 20 best films ever made."
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,Falconetti's performance was one of the apexes of silent film.
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,THE most riveting silent film I have ever seen. Excellent example of Expressionism in film.
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"Powerful and stirring. Falconetti's performance is truly one of the greatest in movie history. You can see the influence Eisenstein's ""Potemkin"" had on Dreyer, but this film is by far superior. A fantastic achievement."

1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"One of the most powerful silent and religious film's ive seen. Maria Falconetti acting is possibly the most intense in any silent film. Yet with or without sound, the film transcends boundaries visually also to portray the struggle of one woman."

1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"Before her star-making turn in BILL AND TED'S EXCELLENT ADVENTURE, Joan of Arc appeared alongside Bobcat Goldthwait and Roseanne Barr in this rollicking sci-fi actioner."

1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,Arguably the most powerful film ever made.
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"To review this movie on Facebook is almost to be subversive of its power. If you are religious, or even if you aren't--- if you're receptive to anything spiritual in any way, watch this movie. It changed my life. It could change yours, too."

1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,When included with Einhorn's beautiful opera (which it is on the Criterion release) this stands with a handful of transcendent films of the silent era. It is the rawest and most stark film in memory.
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"An argument could be made that film may have peaked before 1930 and sound with Potemkin, Metropolis and this brilliant film."
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,Mesmerizing. Sensual. Haunting.  The movement of the film is akin to walking behind someone as they meet there final destiny--it is heart wrenching--I felt like I could reach into the screen and touch her face. Gorgeous film.
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"You can also watch this with a soundtrack which was composed for it afterwards, but it is better to watch it in its silent form, first... Very classic kind of film. The actress I think died early in life and this was her first and only film..."
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,The only thing that would make this a better film is if they edited out all of the medium shots.
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,very advanced acting and cinematography for that era. I was mesmerized by how dramatic the acting was. Stuck to my seat the entire time. Loved it.
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,Probably the best movie about religion ever. Certainly an object lesson about sacrifice.

1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"Beautifully stunning. The camera work, sets and close ups were completely different to what anyone else was doing at that stage, to the point that it holds up just as well today as I believe it would have 80 years ago. One of a kind."
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,Very few pieces of cinema have managed to deliver such strenght relaying almost solely on close-ups and silent expressions. Truly beautiful.

1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"The expressions on her face! A study in silence and stillness and fear and pain! Deep, deep, deep!"

1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,One of the best performances ever filmed.
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"BEAUTIFUL black & white film! Although it's a silent film, Maria Falconetti has the ability to express and emote just with the movement of her body and her eyes. And emote she does! What a POWERFUL film!"
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"Incredibly beautiful. So avant-garde for its time, and the angles, the pacing, and the attention to detail make this a very unique experience. The ""Voices of Light"" soundtrack from the Criterion DVD is beautiful and works perfectly with the film. A great experience."
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,Avoids the frantic qualities of many silent films and delivers some of the most powerful images I have ever seen.It could not be more perfect.
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"i was just SO delighted a film like this got made, & miraculously, it got preserved, considering the war and other events that happened after it was first shown before WWII"
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,Maria Falconetti was amazing. The emotion that came through in this film was amazing. The cinematography is perfect.
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,One of the most involving and tense silent movies ever made - a surprise since it is basically a inquisition / courtroom drama full of closeup shots.
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"Just perfect - far and away my favorite film - what cinema (as opposed to ""movies"") should be - brilliant cinematography combined with passionate storytelling"
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,unbelievable. film as art. one of the greatest films ever made

1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"With the Voices of Light soundtrack added, quite possibly one of the better movies made."
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"Quite possibly the greatest film ever made. Certainly (to my mind) the greatest filmed acting performance, evar. Falconetti, like the slide guitar player Blind Willie Johnson, here sets what must be considered an impossible standard. THIS is why art ... is."
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,The only true competition for Jodorowsky' The Holy Mountain in its evident self-declaration as the monolithic juggernaut against which all films will be inevitably dwarfed by. :P
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"Unlike other Joan of Arc movies, this one has no spectacular action scenes. There are no melodramatic or heroic scenes. And it's a silent movie. But still, this one remains the most mesmerizing version of the French martyr."
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,Hard to believe something like this could have made 80 years ago. One of the most powerful film I've ever seen.
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,why bother with a course in portrait photography? just watch this. exquisite.

1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,Carl Dreyer uses lots of closeups on faces to get us emotionally involved with the story. It helps that the actors--particularly Maria Falconetti as the title character--have such vibrant expressions.
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"I don't often warm (for want of a better word) to movies as old as this so immediately, but Maria Falconetti's is simply the greatest performance I have ever seen. Everything else is, on a first viewing, just icing on the cake. A silent masterpiece."

1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"See this movie before you die. It was not, by the way, intended to be seen without sound (few 'silent' movies were). The Criterion version's soundtrack is just wonderful."
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"Wow. The film features striking compositions, specifically the intense close-ups, kinetic editing and fluid camerawork. It's hard to believe it was made in 1928, as it possesses a sense of cinematic movement that feels contemporary in its execution and energy."

1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"I simply adore this movie. Absolutely my favorite silent film. Other than Intolerance and maybe Sunrise, the most important film of the era. Falconetti's performance is one of the greatest of all time."
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"Amazing and unforgettable. It begins somewhat slow in the beginning, but the second half of the film leading up to the burning of Joan ranks it up with Battleship Potemkin. Falconetti's performance is amazing. Thank god for Criterion Collection."

1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,so hard to belive this film was made in the 1920's its still so powerful
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"Watch this once-lost telling of the last days of Jeanne D'Arc, and be prepared for Maria Falconetti to burn a hole right through you with her eyes. A crusher, a stunner, watch it with your favourite whiskey by your side! Then watch it again."
1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,OMG watch it silent. i saw it with this terrible soundtrack made by some proper cunt who wanted his tacky score to underline all the emotions and as a consequence he thoroughly ruined the film.Otherwise a great film with the addition of Antonin Artaud as one of the accusers.

1.0,passion_of_joan_of_arc,"Renee Falconetti plays the condemned Joan of Arc in this early film. You don't need sound to feel this movie in your soul.

0.0,1010792-its_a_wonderful_life,Well it is definitely not a wonderful movie.
1.0,1010792-its_a_wonderful_life,"Maybe the best holiday film of all-time. There's some real magic at work here from Frank Capra, which is timeless. I almost tear up at the finish every time. I would say, however, that George Bailey probably owes his child's teacher an apology."
1.0,1010792-its_a_wonderful_life,"It's interesting to know that this timeless holiday classic actually wasn't a hit when it first came out on Christmas 1946, but was eventually embraced by millions. Cary Grant was considered for the role, but he was busy filming another excellent film, The Bishop's Wife, playing the angel Dudley."
1.0,1010792-its_a_wonderful_life,It's more wonderful every year I watch it. What makes me marvel at this film so much is how hard it would be to nail all these notes with a modern film.

1.0,grapes_of_wrath,A stellar piece of depression-era Americana that is equal parts mesmerizing and devastating.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Absolutely stunning and heartfelt look into the poverty and hardships felt during the Dust Bowl and Great Depression.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"Surely one of the greatest movies ever made. With the help of John Ford's solid direction and Henry Fonda's brilliant performance, even after 70 years, The Grapes of Wrath still resonates in our heart and delivers powerful messages."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"John Steinbecks's classic must read novel with Henry Fonda as Tom Joad. Set in the Midwest during the Great-Depression and massive dust storms, the Depression era migrants encounter hostile cultural-economic prejudice in migrating to the farms of California."

1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Absolutely Love it. One of my FAVORITES
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Henry Fonda gives possibly the best performance I've ever seen in film.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,John Steinbeck was so stunned by John Ford's adaptation of his classic he quipped 'I believed my own story again'.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"John Fords best film, IMO, you know you did a good film adaptation of a book when the original author liked it more than his own book."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Real gut wrenching film.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Almost as devastating and as superb as the book.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,John Ford's timeless adaptation of the John Steinbeck classic is quite simply one of the greatest movies ever made. It follows the book very closely (Steinbeck wrote the screenplay) and remains to this day both powerful and poignant.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,wow. Still wish I could find the 1989 Steppenwolf production on DVD
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"CLASSIC! About a family in the depression...if you think times are tough now, wathc this movie! Highly recommended! I love this film!"

1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"With the exception of a couple of melodramatic speeches from Ma Joad in the last ten minutes of the film, this is pretty much a perfect movie. Fonda and Darwell are terrific as Tom Joad and Ma Joad, and John Carradine is suitably prophetic as a lapsed preacher."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Must See! The thousands who have read the book will know why THEY DID NOT SELL ANY CHILDREN TICKETS to see this picture!

1.0,grapes_of_wrath,My grandparents lived and fed their families during the depression... When I watch this movie I feel as if i have a small idea of what they endured...
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"Fantastic! One of John Fords best in a filmography of great films. I loved James Stewart in Philadelphia Story, but Henry Fonda should have won the Best Actor Oscar. Jane Darwell was one of the gretest charachter actors ever to live."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"A successful balancing act criticizing the greed and corruption of capitalism without opening itself to accusations of being ""red""."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,This is a truly Classic American movie that is a must see!!!

1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Classic American motion pictures this unsentimental are rare. It might be Ford's best (without Duke anyway)
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"This is a movie better than the book. Don't get me wrong Steinbeck outstanding writer, but America at its best doesn't need socialism. AS moive point the New Deal is better"
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"Loved the novel, loved the movie, simple as that."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,So many John Ford movies to pick from. This is certainly one of his greatest works ever.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Truly a great movie. Perhaps it is because of the honesty it portrays in the characters.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Change movie making and storytelling entirely/.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"Wow. One of the only older dramas that is still very gripping. A great pace and story, wonderful characters. What is it about this and To Kill A Mockingbird that we don't have anymore in movies?"
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,A Classic! Henry Fonda's performance was amazing. This movie shows the crushed human spirit.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Warning to students. The ending of the movie is radically different than the ending of the book.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"One of my favorite all time movies. Brings the meaning of ""dirt poor"" right home."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"amazing. the film was made so realistically, and helped to expose the terrible conditions that these people faced at the time.."

1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Truly great film with great performances. Almost as moving as the book.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,A classic that is just as powerful today as it was upon its release over 65 years ago. For me Henry Fonda's performance ranks as one of the greatest of all time. This is what movies were meant to be.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"A perfect and emotional motion picture. Beautifully written, directed and performed. The cast evokes a collective spirit rarely felt in contemporary cinema. A classic."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"A great film. On every level. ""We're the people!"""
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,*sighs* thats what we do... never give up.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Not as glamourous as some of his Westerns but I still think that it's John Ford's best work. Henry Fonda is so engaging and the mood and feel of this film is perfect for the subject matter.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"I wish more movies today had plots like this. Had filming like this. I think the most prominent special effect was the lighting, and it did so much for the story. The acting was classic...brilliant."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Steinbeck is just as good onscreen as he is on the page.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"Not only is the film rich in plot and acting, the direction and lighting is heavenly. Henry Fonda is truely a master of the art. Too bad he wasn't given an Oscar until the 1980's."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,A history lesson and a great film classic. I wish they make this kind of high-standard movies nowadays.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"Steinbeck's Dust Bowl story by way of Ford's poetic realism. Fonda and Darwell, among others, shine."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"No sex,no violence of any note and it's obviously not in colour. The film though pulls you in until you are 'virtually' part of the family and you experience every emotion they do...at 14 years, seeing this film is what made me a man...I wanted to be a Tom Joad!"
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"Intense, A classic amongst classics."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,John Ford's greatest achievement and one of the finest films ever made. Henry Fonda gives his finest performance ever and Jane Darwell is immortal in an Oscar-winning portrayal of his mum.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"Astonishing piece of cinema that I really wanted to go on and on. Both dialogue and direction excel at lifting from the pages of the book a true masterpiece, slightly spoiled by a Hollywood ending. Aside from that it was cinematic perfection."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,What solidifies its greatness is John Ford's ability to blend the personal and political without causing damage to either characters or themes.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"John Ford made this Steinbeck classic to a ""T"". Fonda's portrayal of Tom Joad is wonderfully real and charismatically appealing. I love this story because of its historically based storyline. The plight of the working man vs. mr. banker. / inspired Bruce Springsteen to write/"
0.0,grapes_of_wrath,"Its actually more painful to watch the movie than it is to read the book, kind of like concentrated torture."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"Not easy to make a film as good as a Steinbeck novel, but with Henry Fonda and John Carradine, this was one of the all time best in film."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Another movie I watched with my Dad. He really helped me connect with the storyline by telling me about his own childhood as the youngest of 7 children born to a family forced to migrate during the Great Depression.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"Not as detailed as the book, but captures the essence of it."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"Humanist, idealistic, beautiful..."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"An amazing film, I just loose myself every time I watch it."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Wonderful film. Fonda has never been better. Jane Darwell is magnificent. Their last scene together is one of the greats of cinema. Heartbreaking.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Probably the best political movie out of the US of A.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"Not many films have come from the USA with a Socialist message, but hey quality counts for something!"
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,One of the greatest American movies ever made.

1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"Ok itÂ´s from (1939?) 1940 and it has been sanitized a little, to make it easier for mass audiences- but still a great movie and an even better read!"
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Steinbeck and Ford at their best
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Another addition to Ford's resevoir of masterpieces. Fonda and Darwell truly seem like mother and son. I loved this film since i was a kid.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"You are Tom Joad. You just got out of prison for stealing, not because you got off for good behavior, but because they simply couldn't afford to keep you anymore. The only difference is that it's not the year 2010"
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"This is a great movie, it will stir your heart."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,a great depiction of the great depression
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,A movie based off of the book about the great depression. Henry fonda is fantastic in this film. Not his best role but one of my favorites. It really portrays the struggles and hardships occuring during the great depression. It's not boring at all.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,An absolute classic tale of human suffereing. A great adaptation of a classic.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"What can I sat, when Ma Joad is putting her things in the stove when they;re leaving their farm behind, I bawl like a little baby. Sure there are a few hammy parts near the end, but darn I start to breaking up again when Tom sings Red River Valley while dancing with his Ma."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"Excellent.....only word I can use to describe this film. Arguably Henry Fonda's best performance, and one of the most noteworthy historical films of American cinema."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,A movie that lives up to the book.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"Har inte läst boken, men den kan inte gärna vara bättre."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Flawless. Few stories have been portrayed as powerfully and with such emotional connection. Gritty realism at its best.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Another rare film that outdoes the literary classic it is portraying
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"An emotionally poweful tale set during the Great Depression, about a destitute American family from the plains who go through suffering and despair in order to find work in a country that was itself in despair. Henry Fonda gives a career-best performance as the headstrong young Tom Joad."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,The lighting techniques are awesome and erie

1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"Once upon a time, there was something called 'US Socialism'. There was Debs, there was a 'dangerous' movement of immigrant labor. Then came the 'New Deal', crushing it all. Oh well."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"A story of poverty, corruption, capitalism, anarchism and activism, but mostly the story of a family struggling to survive and stick together in depression-era United States."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,One of the greatest movies of all time and one of the few movies that rival the novel form. Henry Fonda's performace was absolutely inspiring and this is the most realistic movie I've ever seen.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Brilliant film. Henry Fonda is one of the greatest actors to have ever lived!

1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"This movie should be shown to every high school student today. People need to be reminded that there was a time not so long ago when the country seemed on top of the world, and then everything crashed. This movie is a heart breaker and a life changer."

1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"This definately enters into my Top 50 films...erm maybe top 20. The acting is mediocore, but it's the 1940s afterall. I recommend this movie to people even if they aren't into these kinds of movies. Fairly accurate to the novel..."

1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Amazing movie. Ford and Fonda near the top of their game.

1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Probably the greatest movie I've ever seen.It's haunting in its portrayal of the world & the people of the time. One for the ages.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,A faithful rendering of Steinbeck's classic novel with excellent performances from the entire cast. Fonda's performance as Tom Joad is justly legendary.

1.0,the_third_man,"Thrilling international classic - even though it's mostly in English. Foreshadows the cold war and, when you watch a second time, you'll notice that other co-star: the sewers, streets and buildings of post-war Europe shortly before the reconstruction of the 1950-60's."
1.0,the_third_man,Never gets old. Visually stunning with twists and turns to keep us guessing. Add the dialogue by Graham Greene at his most compelling. A masterpiece.

1.0,the_third_man,"Where do I start praising this film? Exceptional photography, music, storyline, Carol Reed's ""The Third Man"" is obviously one of the greatest films of all time, always leaving you with the feeling that you'll notice something new next time you watch it."
1.0,the_third_man,"Astounding and unpredictable, ""The Third Man"" remains an influential bit of noir and espionage."
1.0,the_third_man,"One of the greats. A masterclass in editing. My only bugbear is it clips along too quickly with never a quiet moment. Hugely visual with a dialogue so rapid the characters inhabit a silent film. But the best films can be judged as silents, so it works whichever way."
1.0,the_third_man,"A dazzling, intricate, nearly-perfect movie. Among its strongest points is one that I treasure highly in stories and films, namely the respect of a writer and director for the intelligence of an audience and our capacity to handle complexity and ambiguity."

1.0,the_third_man,"the film is spectacularly shot, and the score is fantastic (given how iconic and re-used the music is today, modern audiences may fail to recognize its beauty). Performances are fantastic, and even though you can see the twist coming, it still manages to excite"

1.0,the_third_man,How can a human steal a whole movie with so little movie time on it. Only Orson. Interesting from beginning to end. Joseph Cotten is also fantastic as the lead in this amazing thriller.
1.0,the_third_man,Timeless. One of the best final scenes in cinema.
1.0,the_third_man,"If you are searching for a classic crime thriller with very well written characters along with a perfect plot and terrific acting, then you should seriously watch this movie."

1.0,the_third_man,Revisionando obras de arte... :-)))
1.0,the_third_man,One of the great film noir experiences...The introductory shot of Harry Lime(Welles) framed in the doorway by the light is now the stuff of legend...Gorgeous to look at and quite rightly considered one of the greats of cinema...
1.0,the_third_man,So much has been said about the film that this humble reviewer's consensus wouldn't be able to match up to the other more masterful approaches to such a flawless piece of cinema.
1.0,the_third_man,"Maybe one the best movies of all time! The main intrigue and the history were unique. Directing, filming, acting, music and suspense were wonderfully perfect. This ""film noir"" is definitely in my personal top list."

1.0,the_third_man,It's a good movie yall watch it.
1.0,the_third_man,"Between the famous cuckoo clock line and Orson Welles's captivating entrance, (a star part that rivals John Doe's in Se7en) this fantastic noir is one of the most captivating mysteries around."
1.0,the_third_man,A strong contender for best film of all time.
1.0,the_third_man,"I usually find something annoying in famous classics but this one is an exception, I mean it's not just a great movie it's almost flawless & delivers everything perfectly imo, Excellent work from Reed & Greene"

1.0,the_third_man,"When they say, ""they don't make them like that anymore"", they're talking about ""The Third Man""."
1.0,the_third_man,"Film-noir at its very best. Harry Lime has become an icon for the ages... or a non-icon, depending on... this is just a must-see!"
1.0,the_third_man,"Pulp novelist Holly Martins travels to shadowy, postwar Vienna, only to find himself investigating the mysterious death of an old friend, black-market opportunist Harry Lime."
1.0,the_third_man,"The same stars as ""Citizen Kane"" but arguably better. Blissfully cynical and anti-romantic."
1.0,the_third_man,no question one of the stand alone best movies ever made. i don't even know how to explain the levels of moral questioning and choice making that this movie has.

1.0,the_third_man,Has one of my favorite closing shots of any movie I've seen.
1.0,the_third_man,"How can you begin to count the details Carol Reed has put into his brilliant noir? It's Casablanca with a less hopeful ending, yet gripping in the same way as Hitchcock's Vertigo. The score is upbeat, yet carries no real relief, making it even more unsettling."
1.0,the_third_man,This just may top Double Indemnity in the noir category.
0.0,the_third_man,Its not as good as Batman and Robin which is a masterpiece in cinema...
1.0,the_third_man,Five stars just for the last chase scene.
1.0,the_third_man,"Perfect pacing and very progressive cinematography for its time (all those fancy Dutch angles) and ultimately, it is just iconic - mainly for that perfect reveal of Orson Welles as Harry Lime in the doorway, and the great twangy zither music."
1.0,the_third_man,"A funny, yet suspensfull film. Orson Welles comes in later in the film, yet he steals the show with stunning characterization that complements the gloomy atmosphere and bleak visuals of this thriller."
1.0,the_third_man,"I can see why some have called this an ""accidentally"" great film - few of its best strokes relate to the same vision - but it's a great film nonetheless."
1.0,the_third_man,"With amazing camera work, an astounding script, and magnificent performances, The Third Man remains a haunting look at post-war Europe on the verge of Cold War."

1.0,the_third_man,The greatest film of all time. Even the architecture is dazzling.

1.0,the_third_man,"INCREDIBLE movie that can hold up to countless viewings. Every frame is a masterpiece of composition, the story envelopes you, the acting is incredible! I would rate this film a million stars if I could. The word ""brilliant"" doesn't do it justice."
1.0,the_third_man,"The best written mystery of them all, a classic and shocking masterpiece."

1.0,the_third_man,Welles dirigindo de trás da cortina!

1.0,the_third_man,"Thanks, Connie. Now I have to go back and watch it x 2."
1.0,the_third_man,The cinematography in The Third Man is a brilliant performance in itself. I think Peter Bogdanovich said it best when he called it one of the best non-auteur films of all time. Everyone involved in this film did their job brilliantly. An absolute classic and a must see for any film buff.
1.0,the_third_man,"An excellent noir, beautifully shot and directed. Acclaimed novelist Graham Greene pens a tight script and it plays out beautifully on the big screen. Well done."

1.0,the_third_man,"Real film noir, none of this Sin City/The Spirit stylised shit. If I had to pick one film to watch on an endless loop, it would be The Third Man. If you want to see Orson Welles' best performance, get this movie."
1.0,the_third_man,"How could anyone, ever, not adore this movie? It is a sock in the gut, and captures the Nihilistic survival mode that every human can sink to. Tells us a lot about the worst to be found in the human condition. Orson Wells spends maybe seven minutes in front of the camera, totally steals the movie."
1.0,the_third_man,"Thrilling film, and Orson Welles is at his slimy best as Harry Lime."
0.0,the_third_man,Great cinematography and introduction of characters cannot makeup for how lifeless it was. It was a little more than characters and situations moving from point A to B and talking in between.

1.0,the_third_man,"A film way ahead of its time. Penned by Graham Greene and directed by Carol Reed, this film set the mold for 'consipracy' plots for decades to come. Twists, turns, and Orson Welles in a great supporting role to boot!"
1.0,the_third_man,It really is the best film noir. Ever.
1.0,the_third_man,"Arguably the apex of film noir, with a uniformly excellent cast, outstanding cinematography and a well-crafted narrative that provides some of cinema's most striking scenes and dialogue. Anton Karas's evocative zither score is the perfect complement. Classic."

1.0,the_third_man,Easily the best movie I have ever seen. This masterpiece succeeds in keeping its audience emotionally attached to the protagonist until he learns the horrifying truth.
1.0,the_third_man,"Flawless in conception and execution, it's film noir at it's finest, with pitch perfect writing and direction, and boasting immaculate performances. The cinematography is jaw-dropping, creating a ballet of shadows with one of the most incredible uses of lighting I've ever seen."
1.0,the_third_man,Best. Noir. Ever.Orson Welles peels out of the darkness like a dancing bat. No more need be said.

1.0,the_third_man,"I must say this movie is enthralling. While it may seem a little formulaic today, and a little predictable, I still loved it. I'm being forced to consider Orson Welles as a favorite of mine, considering I've yet to watch a movie he's been in and rated it lower than 4 stars."

1.0,the_third_man,"Similar to the film's lead man Harry Lime, I have little to say here - short, brilliant and extremely sweet. That Zither tune makes my day every time."

0.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,"A 90-minute film with 40 minutes of sloppy song-and-dance does not an enjoyable film make. The only thing more appalling than the morals of this film was the acting, singing, and dancing. Boy, did I hate this."
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,"Kanske Marilyns bÃ¤sta film, dÃ¤r hennes charm glÃ¤nser rakt igenom. SÃ¤rskilt bredvid stela Jane Russell, som ofattbart nog var det stora namnet pÃ¥ den tiden som filmen gjordes. Hon fick mycket mer betalt fÃ¶r filmen Ã¤r Marilyn."

1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,This is a classic would strongly recommend.A very good feel good movie. But they new how to make films then
0.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,Certainly did not prefer the blonde in this one. Marilyn Monroe was annoying. I even prefered Jane Russell's version of Diamonds are a Girl's Bestfriend to hers.
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,One of her greatest films. She truly is a star on screen that has yet to be matched. A must see movie with some of the most memorable moments in her too short career. Love the movie and Marilyn even more.

1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,It's a little hard to root for Marilyn to marry to the dorky rich guy but the rest of the film is so damn funny and pleasant to watch that it hardly matters. I sometimes forget what a great commedienne she was and this film proves it in spades.
1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,UNTIL SHE WAS MURDERED MARILYN WAS A SUPERSTAR WHO WAS JUST STARTING TO COME INTO HER OWN.

1.0,gentlemen_prefer_blondes,I totally adore Monroe she was the perfect lady so stunning and coquettish.

1.0,one_flew_over_the_cuckoos_nest,classic for a reason and jack.....jack is amazing in everything!
1.0,one_flew_over_the_cuckoos_nest,"I love this movie! Oddly It feels like a sequel to Cool Hand Luke, but with this time, set in a mental hospital, with Jack Nicholson in the role as a different 'Christ Figure', changing lives of his fellow patients as what Paul Newman did with inmates in the earlier said film. A Must See!"
1.0,one_flew_over_the_cuckoos_nest,"One man's fight against the authority. Great film, great actor."
1.0,one_flew_over_the_cuckoos_nest,"Jack Nicholson stars in an outstanding characterization of Ken Kesey's asylum anti-hero, McMurphy, and Milos Forman's direction of a superbly-cast film is equally meritorious."
0.0,one_flew_over_the_cuckoos_nest,"Nicholson is outstanding in his first Oscar winning performance, but the movie as a whole is really boring."
1.0,one_flew_over_the_cuckoos_nest,probably my all-time favorite movie and nicholson's best performance ever!!!
1.0,one_flew_over_the_cuckoos_nest,"Execution is the key to this film's success, along with the masterful performances in it. The social fabrication of its characters are so tightly bound in a notch of opposing authorities and differences in value and appreciation (also a nod to, as RT says, the culture wars of the '70s)."
1.0,one_flew_over_the_cuckoos_nest,"A beautiful triumph of the human spirit. Surprisingly, the film still holds its power after all these years, and remains one of my favorite movies."

1.0,one_flew_over_the_cuckoos_nest,Jack Nicholson shines in 'One flew over the cukoos nest' which as well as being an intriguing story in itself is a perfect representation of rebellion and control in society. Danny Devito and Christopher Lloyd also make their cinematic debut in what can only be considered as a classic.
1.0,one_flew_over_the_cuckoos_nest,"What can be said about this movie that hasn't already been said? It's brilliant. It's art. It offers so much through storyline, casting, characterization, and simply through general interest. It's the perfect movie."
1.0,one_flew_over_the_cuckoos_nest,Jack Nicholson at his best - totally superb. Only negative comment would be that I would change the ending to the point where the Indian goes over to Jack's bed ... the bit after this was a bit too Hollywood for my liking :-)

1.0,one_flew_over_the_cuckoos_nest,"Even after over thirty years, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest remains a potent demonstration of Milos Forman's directorial talent and the conflict between Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher works as a subtle metaphor of the culture wars of the 70s."

1.0,barry_lyndon,Without a doubt one of the most beautiful films ever made.

1.0,barry_lyndon,"The period costume drama to end all period costume dramas, 'Barry Lyndon' is one of Kubrick's most transporting films, albeit completely through technique and not emotion."
1.0,barry_lyndon,"A penniless Irish boy rises through turgid manhood and 18th-century warfare to become a conceited, embittered aristocrat cursed with cyclical misery, all to forget a first love who hates his guts--this shit is so dope."

1.0,barry_lyndon,Classic movie about class.
1.0,barry_lyndon,"Filmed with grace and honest tragedy not often seen in contemporary films, Barry Lyndon is another Kubrick tally point to his masterful collection of excellent films."
1.0,barry_lyndon,Probably my favorite of all the Kubrick movies I have seen
1.0,barry_lyndon,The greatest film every made. Kubrick's masterpiece is mostly naturally lit and makes use of a completely unoriginal score. Handel's Sarabande strolls us through mid-18th century Europe as Mr. Redmund Barry evolves from an innocent young Irishman to our dullest anti-hero.
1.0,barry_lyndon,"It's like a sad, beautiful and colorful painting."
1.0,barry_lyndon,"The understated performances and calculated pace of Barry Lyndon compliment the immaculately pretty cinematography. The film's irony and analytical approach bypass mere entertainment value, resulting instead in a piece of artistic genius that deserves more recognition than it gets."
1.0,barry_lyndon,"This masterpiece of Kubrick is literally a trip into the 18th century to witness the rise and fall of Barry Lyndon. An original and captivating idea and story line. It's just good. Well I don't see why it shouldn't be, it's Kubrick!!!!!"
1.0,barry_lyndon,"A lavish, beautifully shot period piece from one of cinema's finest craftsman, 'Barry Lyndon' remains somewhat overlooked in Kubrick's catalog. If you haven't seen it, do so immediately. The final showdown is devastating."
1.0,barry_lyndon,"Although it is supposed to be a tragic drama, I really thought it was more of a comedy, then again I have a sick sense of humor, so watch it, draw you own conclusion, a fine cinematic achievement nonetheless."
1.0,barry_lyndon,This was so good. It was slow but it was so interesting it didn't matter. I felt like I lived his life after it was done.
1.0,barry_lyndon,"Kubrick's most elaborate film, with a scope that spans decades and continents, is a magnificent character piece, filled with adventure, romance, bravado, and tragedy."
1.0,barry_lyndon,"Kubrick is a world class artist with film and shows it in 18th century England's ""Barry Lyndon""."
1.0,barry_lyndon,"It's Kubrick. Another genre game breaker. This time, period drama."
1.0,barry_lyndon,"Ties with The Shining as Kubrick's best. It's bold, daring, and epic."
1.0,barry_lyndon,"A Kubrick masterpiece. It's so beautifully framed, as if you were walking into a painting. It's tremendously beautiful, epic, entertaining, and full of dry humor. The pacing and rhythm cause 3 hours to feel like 2. A real cinematic treat from one of cinemas greatest directors."
1.0,barry_lyndon,Tremendously well made with great directering by Kubrick
1.0,barry_lyndon,"Breathtakingly beautiful, yet cold and impersonal, Kubrick (as with most of his films) never lets you take part in the action. You're simply are a mere spectator, and therein lies the beauty of it."
1.0,barry_lyndon,"Slow paced but beautiful to watch. Like others have said, it's artwork in motion."
1.0,barry_lyndon,"A stunningly brilliant photography that complements a subtle story of finding one self within the ranks of society, Kubrick´s adaptation of Thackeray is nothing less than a masterpiece forever to be admired!"
1.0,barry_lyndon,This is Kubrick's most underrated film. Visually stunning. This three hour epic will fly by. One of the best period pieces out there.

1.0,barry_lyndon,"Last Kubrick film I hadn't seen before. Fantastic story, amazing visuals, classic film."
1.0,barry_lyndon,"Perfection. Watch it and admire his craft. No one has ever come close to him in his field - a one off. Produced, directed, written and conceived - a total film nut who appreciated beauty and depth in film as art."
1.0,barry_lyndon,"Underrated, must see Kubrick, every scene has historical artistic scenery"
1.0,barry_lyndon,"A visual masterpiece, controlled brilliantly by its benign sense of Kubrickian control."

1.0,barry_lyndon,"Not a film, but more so a work of art."

1.0,barry_lyndon,A sprawling epic from a master of cinema
1.0,barry_lyndon,...due to death threats I am changing the rating to 5 out of 5.
1.0,barry_lyndon,This movie is probably the closest a film has ever gotten to looking like a classical painting. It's beautiful and extremely entertaining given its nearly three and a half hour running time. The scene in the barn towards the end of the movie is so good and Ryan O'Neal gives a great performance.
1.0,barry_lyndon,"Arguably Stanley Kubrick's best, certainly his loveliest picture."
1.0,barry_lyndon,"A 3 hour moving painting. Great story of Barry Lyndon, elegantly told. This is basically a 3 hour crash course in directing by the brilliant Stanley Kubrick. Masterfully directed, extremely underrated and I might go as far as to call it his greatest film."
1.0,barry_lyndon,Near perfect a masterpiece
1.0,barry_lyndon,One of Kubrick's best! Definetely underappreciated. Though I must say the second half is better than the first.

1.0,barry_lyndon,"problably the best period film ever made, one of the kubrick´s best. a must see for any movie lover and kubrick´s fan. it never gets old, just gets better. a classic!"
1.0,barry_lyndon,"This 3 hour film set in 18th Century England redefines the word 'epic' and is the sadly forgotten masterpiece from Kubrick, more than worthy to sit alongside his other great contributions to cinema and (dare I say) art. Outstanding and gripping with every viewing."
1.0,barry_lyndon,"Dazzling environments and costumes, fine acting and dialogue, and a unique storyline make Barry Lyndon a wonderful film. The continuing plot and narrative add to the overall tone and moral of the movie. One of my favorites."
1.0,barry_lyndon,"It is easy to call this epic artistic film ""perfect"", but this is what it is. You would be stunned with emotion and cannot rise from your seat for a while, maybe for hours."
1.0,barry_lyndon,"A visual breakthrough, and one of the few colonial times peaces that provides as much characterization as there is decadence and those white wigs"
1.0,barry_lyndon,Possibly Kubrick's greatest achievement.
1.0,barry_lyndon,Can't take your eyes off it
1.0,barry_lyndon,Could watch this one over and over. The dark comedy and subtle acting is priceless! Kubrick is a master and this is my favorite film by him hands down.

1.0,barry_lyndon,Kubrick was a genius.
1.0,barry_lyndon,forever my favorite filmmaker...i can't believe I waited this long to see it. this film is incredible.
1.0,barry_lyndon,A Kubrick masterpiece. The imagery is beautiful and the story is well crafted. An 18th century period piece about a British officer that is always looking for a way to gain fortune to marry someone that is out of his class. I think this should be in the criterion collection.

1.0,barry_lyndon,An underrated Kubrick masterpiece.

1.0,barry_lyndon,Every still from this film could be a neoclassical painting as the film slightly destroys it own hero. It doesn't decide for us what his role in the film is.
1.0,barry_lyndon,"A all around beautifully film thats well crafted and a excellent kubrick film. Some shots are remarkable, a great score, and great acting. Alot of people call it long and boring but I disagree for its a great film thats both intriguing and mesmerizing."

1.0,barry_lyndon,"The length of Barry Lyndon didn't bother me at all. In fact, this felt more like 2 hours than 3. Why? Because Kubrick creates an atmosphere you don't want to leave. Like all his other films, every shot is given the right amount of attention. Patrick Magee was excellent."
1.0,barry_lyndon,A great story of a man who struggles to the top during the 18th century. he starts at the bottom and works his way up to be very powerful only to plunnit back down. a masterpiece by Stanly Kubrick that should never be forgotten.
1.0,barry_lyndon,"The most beautiful film ever? Brilliant score, epic story and fantastic cinematography. An underated gem."
1.0,barry_lyndon,"One of Kubrick's best, it is hypnotic in its pacing and deliberate painterly images that confine the characters and the action in an inexorable narrative. A true cinematic experience that I hope to see screened on the big screen some day."

1.0,barry_lyndon,"A lush, gorgeous period epic. Detailed, extravagant, and filmed with a detachment only Stanley Kubrick himself could be capable of. The script is deadpan but not without wit, and the plot unfolds in a totally enthralling manner."
1.0,barry_lyndon,"Una obra maestra, un trabajo fabuloso en la direcciÃ³n y guiÃ³n de la cinta, una joya en ambos rubros. Una fotografÃ­a espectacular, vestuarios y escenarios encantadores, simplemente brillante. Ganadora de 3 Oscar y nominada a Mejor PelÃ­cula en 1975"

1.0,barry_lyndon,The direction is amazing and the cinematography is beautiful.
1.0,barry_lyndon,Kanskje den beste jeg har sett!
1.0,barry_lyndon,This is an exquisite film with gorgeous cinematography about a rogue (that some may find likable) that accomplishes his goals but doesn't know how to behave afterwards. It's clearly also a severe indictment of 18th century European culture for its lack of morality and decent values.
1.0,barry_lyndon,"I love this film. Everything about it is beautiful, graceful and almost melodic. Perhaps the best part of it is the music, or maybe it's the plot, or the sets, or the costumes, or the plot!!!! I can't decided what I like more!!!!"

1.0,barry_lyndon,"Watching this again, my favorite film!, I can't decide if the film plays like a black comedy or a melodrama or both. I mean, yes, Barry's fate seems tragic but, from a totally detached perspective, it also seems so insignificant to be funny."

1.0,freaks,"Great film about circus sideshow performers, it's more of a melodrama than a horror movie but it is interesting that the film even got made in 1932. Todd Browning does a really good job with the subject matter and the performers do an excellent job in front of the camera."

1.0,freaks,"""Freaks"", el fenomeno de culto dirigido por Todd Browning (""Dracula"") en 1932 es todavia una pelicula extrana, hipnotica, repulsiva y aterradora que pone la piel de gallina. Hasta ahora, ninguna pelicula de Tim Burton ha logrado el grado de visceralidad gotica de ""Freaks"". Sigue intentandolo, Tim!"
1.0,freaks,"Masterpiece is an overused word but I think it can be applied to this film with a high degree of accuracy. An honest film that we wouldn't see the likes of today, if you get the chance, watch it."

1.0,freaks,"It's unfortunate that a movie like this destroyed Tod Browning's career and revolted so many people. The truth is, it shows a truth to humanity and who we are as people that the world didn't want to face, and still doesn't in a lot of ways."
1.0,freaks,This is a truly bizarre horror movie from Todd Browning and released in 1932. One of my favorites!

1.0,freaks,my favorite film of all time
1.0,freaks,"so ahead of its time. still quite shocking today for its subject matter, yet it involves you in the most natural way by immersing you so fully into the experience of ""freaks"" that by the end you feel that there us no difference between us and them."
1.0,freaks,"Probably the most amazing thing about ""Freaks"" is the fact that Tod Browning actually used real-life circus freaks. The film is joyous and its freakish. The film manages to make us feel comfortable around these circus before the actual horror occurs. a horror classic in its own right."
1.0,freaks,"One of the best movies I've ever watched. It's so completely beautiful, a natural beauty. I can only imagine the impact it had back then."

1.0,freaks,Probably one of my favourite films ever!Still genuinely disturbing despite it's age. My only criticism (if it can really be called one) is that the original ending was cut. Apparently people weren't too keen on castration. Who knew!
1.0,freaks,"What does it mean to be normal? That what the film asks. The freaks aren't whats scary about this film... its the ""normal"" people."

1.0,freaks,"This movie is great, but I still gotta wonder what that quadriplegic guy is going to do with the knife. The tacked-on Hollywood ending was pretty bad though. I usually stop watching just after the climax for this reason."

1.0,freaks,"This movie is GREAT. It isn't politically correct, but it is historically correct, and horrifying. A true horror film, where beautiful becomes ugly, and ugly becomes beautiful. The nightmares can go on for weeks."
1.0,freaks,THAT HUMAN TORSO GUY ROLLING A FUCKING CIGARETTE IS THE BEST SCENE IN A MOVIE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! HOW THE HELL DID HE DO THAT????????????????
1.0,freaks,"this movie is a classic horror film, it's tragic, it's racist, and it's absoltely disturbing, it's brilliant and will just flat out make you cry sometimes, but nothing can ever out do Tod Browning's classic, FREAKS"
1.0,freaks,Disturbing. Who is the real freak?
1.0,freaks,"So much better than Dracula and still as powerfull as it was in 1932, it's definitely a must see (with femme fatale Olga Baclanova, gulp!)... too bad the studios wanted a happy ending!"
1.0,freaks,"A must-see for any horror film buff. A timeless classic that can now never be re-done, thanks to this era of ""political correctness""....which is sort of a shame...even if only to provide work for folks who could use some extra income."
1.0,freaks,"I love this movie.  ""one of us, one of us!"""
1.0,freaks,Ahead of its time. dark as they come and a ballsy move on Brownings part to cast real authentic (freaks as the movie calls them). Then top it all off with a cruel story line and you have your self a hit. (nn)
1.0,freaks,Esto es otro clásico un reparto muy variopinto.Una peli donde la belleza solo es una mascara.Venganza!
1.0,freaks,"This movie is so cool. The atmosphere of the attack is surreal. And remember, there is no makeup in this one, it's all real."
1.0,freaks,One Of the best movies ever
1.0,freaks,"This film is so twisted that how could a lover of the bizarre like me possibly not adore it? It is horrifying and bold and you will be unable to get its hypnotic chant out of your head: ""Gooble gobble, one of us. One of us."""
1.0,freaks,An beautifully moving and well crafted 'horror' film. Browning's very liberal approach to the subject matter is absoultely couragous and deserves massive applause.
1.0,freaks,"One of my favorites, Freaks is an amazingly empathetic and showcases the sideshow well. The voice of Hans is gold. You really feel for the freaks as the beautiful people are the antagonists."
1.0,freaks,Fantastic and a must see.
1.0,freaks,"Wow, I didn't expect to see this on quick rate! This is easilly one of my favorite horror films ever made! I would say this is Tod Browning's masterpiece, even more so than 'Dracula'. They definitely would not make this film today! ""Gooble gobble, gooble gobble, one of us! one of us!"""
1.0,freaks,"Que tal el reparto de esta peli WOW!!!!! esto si que son freaks, una historia de desamor y veganza en uno de esos circos macabros de principios del siglo XX"
1.0,freaks,"One of my favorite Tod Browning films. Considered controversial (especially at the time of its release), for his use of actors with actual deformities."
1.0,freaks,"One of the best horror films of the golden era of cinema. It is actually quite touching, sweet, and heartfelt,a s well as being totally weird and bizarre."

1.0,freaks,=0DD youtube is my new movie theater for rare antiques. /o/
1.0,freaks,"A pre modern gem of a film. Banned in the U.S.A for a short while, Freaks covers some serious topics while maintaining this eery and disturbing feeling. The film is sorely overlooked as one of the all time greatest. In my opinion, Freaks is the finest horror film ever made, and maybe the creepiest."
1.0,freaks,After FINALLY watching this movie I have decided that it is most likely to be in my top 10 favourite films of all time.

1.0,1010678-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,"Every bit an icon as it is a staple in science-fiction cinema, Invasion fits an entire story of political and fear-driven commentary within a short amount of time.

1.0,1010678-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,Intense suspense and fear without relying upon the crutch of elaborate special effects. Reflects a skill in directing is which is only occassionally seen in the horror genre. My vote for best horror film of all time. The remakes have been poor efforts.
1.0,1010678-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,Classic; still beats all the remakes
1.0,1010678-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,Origianal is sometimes best. Superb.
1.0,1010678-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,Saw it ages ago .. And I can't stop watching it. Like 1984 with aliens and a perfect portrait of political paranoia . Plus all the philosophical stuff you can just get out of it if you think a little.
1.0,1010678-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,Innocence lost never to be found again.

1.0,1010678-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,Although it was made in 1956 - this is THE classic of it's era. Very paranoid....you will never look at your family or colleages in the same light.
1.0,1010678-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,This for me is the classic horror flick. The moment of horrible realization after the kiss is such a great scene and so original for the time too. Fantastic film.

1.0,1010678-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,Anyone else for a cinematic allegory to the huaac
1.0,1010678-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,Classic allegorical 1950s sci-fi piece whose ideas and themes haven't dated at all. Story about people being replaced by emotionless duplicates still provides thrills and chills. Even the studio-enforced happy(ish) ending can't spoil it.

1.0,1010678-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,"This is classic sci-fi. I have to put this down with the 1978 version, both have their own 'twists' which add their own flavour - but this was the one that started all the remakes.

1.0,modern_times,The Tramp at his most thought-provoking - and at his funniest.

1.0,modern_times,The best Chaplin and one of the funniest films.

1.0,modern_times,"Charlie Chaplin does cocaine in this movie, or, as its called in the 30s, ""dangerous nose powder"""
1.0,modern_times,A film that even holds a strong message today about industrialization. Notice how in one scene Charlie literally gets swallowed in the mechanical feats of industries...
1.0,modern_times,Chaplin's first foray into social commentary as a narrative structure and he pulls it off stunningly. The perils of the evolution of technology will someday exceed that of human ingenuity.
1.0,modern_times,"The masterpiece that has the ability to make us laugh out loud until we hurt, as well as cherish the world we have today. There's never a dull moment with Charlie Chaplin, and there doesn't need to be."

1.0,modern_times,Classic Chaplin and the first time w hear his voice. The set designs and gags are brilliantly conceived.
1.0,modern_times,"Now almost seventy-five years old, this black-and-white film - almost entirely silent even though talkies had already been prominent for around a decade by then - still feels completely relevant, innovative and brilliant. And that says it all about Chaplin's work - it is one for the ages."
1.0,modern_times,Simply amazing. Best of Chaplin.
1.0,modern_times,There was only one person funnier than Lucille Ball and that person was Charlie Chaplin. Here is his masterpiece (and his last silent film). It's amazing how well it stands up. I laughed my ass off. Genius bit of comedy.

1.0,modern_times,"Has been referred to as the last great silent movie, the last appearance by the Little Tramp, and the funniest movie ever made. Now that is really saying something."

1.0,modern_times,"classic, enjoyable, and socially aware"
1.0,modern_times,"Chaplin is a cinematic genius, his Silent films are of the few I can watch over and over an always enjoy."

1.0,modern_times,"Putting a story for a great concept, one of the most successful experiments for ""Filming a Concept""."
1.0,modern_times,Chaplin was a genius...and my idol. Nothing has ever shown the dehumanization and alienation of labor as effectively as Modern Times. A truly Marxist call to arms. Love it.
1.0,modern_times,one of the best films of all time
1.0,modern_times,"A Chaplin's masterpiece, but still not better than City Lights (at least for me)."

1.0,modern_times,"While there are in fact sound effects and even sparse dialouge, it is absolutely a silent film. Delightfully so."
1.0,modern_times,One of Charlie Chaplins funniest films. His physical humor is timeless and had me laughing for the whole duration. Its also a interesting take on the depression.
1.0,modern_times,wat is paulette goddard goed!
1.0,modern_times,A milestone in cinematic comedy.
1.0,modern_times,"One of Chaplin's best. He seems to make the ""lovable tramp"" story come alive movie after movie. It is the perfect example of the way a movie should be made."

1.0,modern_times,one of the movies ive actually laughed at so so hard
1.0,modern_times,Hvordan bedÃ¸mmer man den nok bedste stumfilm i historien? Det er en genial samfundskritisk film. Som alle Charlie Chaplin film er den hylende sjov og dybt rÃ¸rende! Som altid en skÃ¦rk kommentar til samtiden og eftertiden...
1.0,modern_times,"charlie chaplin....indeed the best comedian of all times. he proves over and over again that he is not only a fantastic comedian, but also a man with great insight about the dangers of the modern world. a true visionary."
1.0,modern_times,"I think the scene in which Charlie eats cocaine thinking it's sugar is one of the funniest in cinema. Honestly, it's right up there with the presidents phone conversation with the Russian premire in ""Dr. Strangelove""; and with that scene with the two little kids and the coffee in ""Airplane!""."
1.0,modern_times,"Chaplin at his best. They say it's dangerous business to dissect comedy. The great thing about Chaplin's physical comedic perfection is that it just hits you. So much genius so early, it's no wonder he struggled to find his footing in the sound era."
1.0,modern_times,Once again Chaplin is amazing... it never ceases to amaze me how he can make any bad moment completely go away. A truly gifted person.
1.0,modern_times,Chaplin era de verdad un genio !!!!
1.0,modern_times,"Modern Times remains Chaplin's most sustained burlesque of authority: It's replete with strikes and police riots, and one of the most celebrated gags has the Tramp inadvertently leading a worker demonstration and being jailed?not for the last time?as an agitator"
1.0,modern_times,Love this film...but love Metropolis even more....without the crappy music they score it to later.
1.0,modern_times,"I can say that this film is easily in my top 3 favorite films ever. I love everything about this film.

1.0,modern_times,"This is the 2nd-greatest silent movie. Here's why you should watch it: it's short, it has really cool hands-on stunts (no stuntmen, just Chaplin). Plus, it's funny."
1.0,modern_times,"""I'm Charlie Chaplin and I do cocaaaiine.""  -Charlie Chaplin, Modern Times (1936)  The first quarter of this movie made me think of Metropolis if Fritz Lang had decided to make it slapstick."
1.0,modern_times,What to say more...He is an icon! A must see masterpiece!
1.0,modern_times,This truly shows Chaplin ahead of his time. The true power industrial revolution and the decline for individuality.
1.0,modern_times,GRANDMASTER OF CHAPLIN
1.0,modern_times,"I was looking over by past ratings without reviews, and I saw this one was at 6/10. I was about to curse myself out. How could I give it a 6? Am I a heartless idiot? This movie is inventive and everything is just right."
1.0,modern_times,"A joyous comedy, an uplifting film, and a pretty decent social commentary all in one. There are many amazing scenes, most notably the factory scene and the gibberish song. This is my favorite Chaplin film and amongst my favorite film of all time."
1.0,modern_times,Chaplin and Walter Benjamin down by the schoolyard.
1.0,modern_times,"along with City Lights, my favorite Chaplin. Top 20 all time"
1.0,modern_times,"Probably my favorite Chaplin film. Says more about America and forward progress than any drama ever did. It's really weird to see it today with the late 00s current employment atmosphere. Really funny, too. Just a pure classic on every level."
1.0,modern_times,"A time capsule of a perfect Hollywood black and white slapstick comedy, starring a still irreverent Charlie Chaplin, plus an adorable love story thrown in as well. I watched this in college and was blown away by the technical effects and the mad storyline."
1.0,modern_times,Quite possibly Chaplin's best film and one of my favourite films of the silent era!
1.0,modern_times,don't you just love the man?!
1.0,modern_times,The man's a visionary... and Paulette Goddard is very sexy barefoot. I want to warch it again in 2036. It's definetly not Buckingham Palace - much better!

1.0,modern_times,Classic. Chaplin was a comedic genius.
1.0,modern_times,"Mas que una comedia, ""Tiempos Modernos"" es un comentario social acerca de la autodestruccion gradual del hombre a partir de la industria. Comidas rapidas, falta de sueno, relaciones afectivas neutralizadas. Hace una pareja perfecta con ""Nous La LibertÃ©"" de RenÃ© Clair."
1.0,modern_times,Charlie Chaplin is the God of Silent Cinema (or singing gibberish).
1.0,modern_times,one of Chaplin's finest

1.0,modern_times,The BEST MOVIE EVER!!!
1.0,modern_times,"Like previously mentioned, this is a classic. I showed 15 minutes of it to a class of 17 year-olds and they really liked it. Despite silent comedies being a thing of the past, Chaplin's comedy still can attract an audience of some of the toughest critics."

1.0,modern_times,"Cinema at it's finest. It entertains, makes you laugh, cry, and forget about your life for a moment in time. This is a work of art, and it's no wonder Charlie Chaplin is legendary. I wish they still made films like this."
1.0,modern_times,como el hombre es reemplazado por la maquina
1.0,modern_times,"""Modern Times"" is a movie that quietly showed a man suffering through a world of change. It is Chaplin's first full sound film and one that brands itself on the souls of all true lovers of the cinema. I loved it!"

1.0,modern_times,Hilarious. Excellent. Sad. Depressing. Meaningful. Chaplin. This film puts together drama and comedy together with a message about the hardship of jobs and families in the early 1900's. Great film by Charles Chaplin.

1.0,modern_times,We still laugh at these films today. Chapin knew how to write timeless films.
1.0,modern_times,I love when the Tramp gets wound up in machine gears then goes completely insane when he comes out.
1.0,modern_times,"I don't care what you think. It's bloody great. (The camerawork, considering the cameras available, is astonishing.) Cog in the machine, indeed."
1.0,modern_times,Come si fa a commentare un genio?
1.0,modern_times,"Chaplin once again manages to pull off a fantastic film mixing sight gags with political commentary. And like another great comedian George Carlin, was anti technology."
1.0,modern_times,Un filme que aplica para cualquier tipo de estudio y para cualquier tipo de gusto. Chaplin pierde la cabeza intentando trabajando en una fabrica. Te suena a algo familiar a lo que te ocurre diariamente?
1.0,modern_times,I absolutely love this movie. I was lucky enough to stumble on it when it was showing on TCM while flipping through channels and the superb talent of Chaplin made my jaw drop to the floor. He set the bar for physical comedy that no one can come close to these days.
1.0,modern_times,"It amazes me how Chaplin is able to write, direct, choreograph, act, and compose and everything else all equally perfectly."
1.0,modern_times,My favorite Chaplin film!

1.0,modern_times,"This film is brilliantly funny and very well-put together. It's the first Charlie Chaplin movie I've seen, and he's fantastic. The way he uses his body as a prop, the way he reveals feelings physically instead of verbally, and his complete understanding of comedy makes him a total genius."

1.0,modern_times,Genuine film genius.
1.0,modern_times,The ups and severe downs of life in the era of modernization and economic depression. The film itself is a farewell to silent cinema. Chaplin's final silent does feature sound though (through a memorable song and interesting sound effect gags).
1.0,modern_times,"One of the best film EVER. Chaplin is a master, capable of make the audience laugh, cry and think deeply to modern society's problems. It is not the first movie to deal with the theme of mand and industrialization, but it does it in Chaplin's ""deep lightness"" unique style."

1.0,modern_times,"Friggin hilarious. This is the third Chaplin movie I've seen over the past few months, and all three have been fantastic. Fantastic timing and great physical comedy. The eating machine scene alone is funnier than 23 modern comedies combined. (I'll say it, you suck Jim Carey.)"
1.0,modern_times,"The best Chaplin movie, and that's high praise."

1.0,modern_times,A fitting and phenomenal last film of Charlie Chaplin's tramp character.

Its been a long time since I've so rooted for one."
1.0,sunrise,"This is a breathtaking film, made in 1927, the last year of silent films. The visuals, cinematography and acting could be carried over to any other decade and still survive the harsh depreciation of being as modern as it was when it was first released."

1.0,sunrise,While I always preferred Frtiz Lang to F.W. Murnau this is a masterpiece that's both moving and fun to watch. Definitely one of the best love stories ever put on film with a tiny hint of very early film noir (early in the film)
1.0,sunrise,"One of the greatest testaments to the power of silent cinema. F. W. Murnau's sublime wordless weepie transcends crowd-pleasing melodrama into high art, luminous poetry and a virtuous moral fable. This is, arguably, the Citizen Kane of the silent era."

1.0,sunrise,One of the greatest dramas-love stories ever and I think it's the first of its kind. Murnau used all the technics of his time and made a masterpiece. Also the man (George O' Brien) and the woman (Janet Gaynor) were the ideal actors and were great.
1.0,sunrise,"Hadn't seen this one for years, and I should have. Its fabulous."

1.0,sunrise,Quite simply the most beautiful film ever; I need not say more.
1.0,sunrise,"A great instance where a film's silence improves it, everything that happens in the film benefits from the room given to the audience to contemplate, personalise and interact with the film. A technical marvel too."
1.0,sunrise,"This deservedly revered silent masterpiece is a technical tour de force, with remarkable camera movement and in camera effects. Even the title cards appear to be lovingly hand painted. If you're at all interested in early cinema, this is pretty much essential viewing."

1.0,sunrise,Quite simply the most beautiful movie ever made.
1.0,sunrise,Probably the crowning achievement of Murnau's career.
1.0,sunrise,A spectacular effort. It is particularly impressive how Murnau manages to tell the story almost entirely with pictures (intertitles are used very sparingly); the camera-work and cinematography are quite simply stunning.
1.0,sunrise,Never seen better...
1.0,sunrise,So beautiful and inventive.
1.0,sunrise,One of the all-time greats!
1.0,sunrise,"Stick with it through the dark impressionist opening and your rewarded with a beautiful tale of reconciliation and renewed love. Murnau's direction through the boat, tram and church scenes is just breathtaking."

0.0,sunrise,"Unsurprisingly the bits that work best smack of classic horror, The rest is wildly over-played and very tedious"
1.0,sunrise,F.W Murnau was a visionary of his time and he delivers with this poetic film that has everything.

1.0,sunrise,The best movie of all times.
1.0,sunrise,Best silent movie. Wow it's good.
1.0,sunrise,"Masterpiece? Totally. Anyone that ever thought a silent film could entertaining obviously hasn't seen this one. Janet Gaynor is incredible in conveying emotion without words, and for its time and even beyond it's visually stimulating at points and shows what movies should be."

1.0,sunrise,Uhhhh.. the ending...

Black and white? Silent? I dunno, man.""  Needless to say, I was blown away like a roof tile in a hurricane. Ha!"
1.0,sunrise,An excellent love story about how love can defeat lust.
1.0,sunrise,"A man and a woman fall in love again in one day in the city. This film should be shown to any would-be director. What you can achieve in silent mode and with no effects but a camera. Fantastic, love the tram scene and the walk through the city. I feel an Americanism coming on ""Awesome"". Murnau, wow"
1.0,sunrise,An amazing film for it technical ingenuity and depth of emotion. Unfortunately the story is elliptical and without strong structure. It's more about watching and experiencing then intellectual thought. For it's time its a masterpiece

1.0,psycho,"The original slasher - its interesting to see where newer slashers went wrong. By having more developed characters and a more fleshed out story, low kill counts feel much, much higher. A great blend of noir and slasher genres. As always with Hitchcock, the tension is consistently high."
1.0,psycho,A classic....Hitchcock's reminder to audiences that he will forever be the Master of Suspense. Loved it.
1.0,psycho,"I hate horror movies, yet I loved this movie. A striking, masterfully made film.

1.0,psycho,it does not get any better then this
1.0,psycho,This is a perfect example of what a horror murder film should be. It's about the examination of the psychological profile of the killer and not about the evisceration of dumbass porn stars who cannot act at all like most other horror murderer films.

1.0,the_young_girls_of_rochefort,"Colorful, fun, and full of dancing and music, ""The Young Girls of Rochefort"" is probably the first French musical I've ever seen, and it's catchy tunes and upbeat jazz stylings have made it an instant favorite of mine."
0.0,the_young_girls_of_rochefort,"I don't know why this is so highly rated. Although it has star appeal, the writing is abyssmal, the music boring and repetitive, the dance numbers uninspired, and the storyline formulaic. As a musical, it's at its weakest point, but it doesn't work as a rom-com either. I struggled to get through it."

0.0,the_young_girls_of_rochefort,A very disappointing musical from Jacques Demy - terrible story and boring songs. The costumes are farcical: trousers tucked into white boots? You can see the terrible glint of Xanadu in Gene Kelly's droopy eyes. Much better to watch Umbrellas of Cherbourg again.

1.0,on_the_waterfront,On the Waterfront remains a benchmark in film thanks to Marlon Brando's excellent performance (both brooding and explosive) in this terrific yarn of mob brutality that doubles as a sharp allegory of the might people have within them to overthrow an oppressive power.

1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"Chef d'oeuvre!!! Revu ce film en Blu-ray, une merveille! Ce film est l'un des premiers, à contre-courant total de son époque, a voir absolument!"
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,One of the best movies of all time. Watched this as a kid everytime it was on and I still watch it regularly! An absolute classic.
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,I cant believe they remade this and put KEANU REEVES in it! WTF?!
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,This is classic Science Fiction. Don't confuse this with the remake with Keanu Reeves (2008). A must see!
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,A great film with a nice moral in a terrifying tone of ultimatum. It`s one of the greatest Sci-Fi films ever made. It`s original plot gives us the kicks and the giant robot Gort gives the film the most originality.
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,My all time favirote!!! A Must see for any Sci-Fi Fan
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,One of the greatest sci- fi films ever made.
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,Esto si es una Obra Maestra y no su fallido casi ridiculo remake
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,The ONLY version of this movie that you ever need to see!
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"Great movie, a Scifi classic."
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"After watching this, I'm afraid to watch the remake. This is not so much because the original scared me (it is creepy though) and I think the new one will be scarier. I just don't want to see this great movie butchered. This is truly a great movie that deserves its status as a classic."
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"A first rate film from start to finish; skip the remake, the original is where it's at! :D"
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,Love the original and the story is so dark.
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"Not cheezy at all, and very interesting. This movie was perfect for the cold war, and the message still means a lot today. The character of Klaatu was my favorite as he was reasonable, logical, understanding and all he wanted to do was help even when the humans shot him. (twice.)"
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,A true classic of the science fiction genre. A truly influencial and unforgettable gem that stands as one of the best of it's kind. A brilliantly entertaining and exhilerating film.
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"One of the greatest Science Fiction Movies ever made!!! Don't bother with remakes, go with the original films and discover why they were made in the first place. The message in this version is so strong it can't be overlooked, as it still applies today!"
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,This is such a cool old movie. :D  I'm pretty pissed that it's being remade. With Keanu Reeves. That just makes it worse.
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"I love this movie, despite the fact that at no point in the film did the world actually stand still. Perhaps in the 50's, an alien stopping all cars for an hour to prove a point was the equivalent to the world actually coming to a stop."
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,A classic movie that crosses the barriers of a time. Even today it's poignant message is stil felt.
0.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"Total anti-war propaganda, boring and preachy."
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,Beautiful! There's something about these clasics you just can't beat
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,An absolute Sci Fi cllassic. Effects look a little cranky. Still a powerful movie today.
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,Michael Rennie was fantastic
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"This movie had an incredible impact on me, and made me a confirmed Michael Rennie fan for life. The soundtrack is amazing, and the storyline is so thought-provoking. This one haunts me."

1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,Best sci fi movie of all times. sorry huttlet.
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,Classic Science Fiction
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"Much better than the remake. A film that gets people in touch with a higher truth. That the human race's survival means thinking in larger terms; thinking that we're more alike than different. It envokes the lyrics of ""Imagine"" by John Lennon."
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,This is classic stuff. Keanu Reeves is no Michael Rennie!
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"i love this movie, and compared to todays movies that most of wiich are recorded for a person with the attention span of a 3 year old hyper active child in a cocaine factory, i thought it was very fast, and for the mystery that was left at the end, it just adds to the suspense."
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,By far one of my favourite movies. Simple message the whole world really needs.... shame it may never happen.
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"""74% uninterested"" is proof-positive that George Harrison was right; the world really is doomed."
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"An excellent piece of classic cinema during a time of widespread fear across the globe. A true critique on the policies of the media and governments at home and abroad. In all honesty, no stupid, over effects driven quote-unquote remake can ever replace this wonderful treasure."
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,THIS WAS THE FIRST SCARY MOVIE I SEEN@AGE 09
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"I love this movie, the old one. I give it 5 stars."
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,OH man classic all i can say one of the best movies ever
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"I watched it a few weeks ago, still had me on the edge of my seat."
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"1000% better than the 2008 version. Sure, it's b/w and from 1951 ""studio technology"", but TRUST me...this is pretty much my fav movie ever, and I was appalled @ the ""remake""! If it ain't broke, don't fix it! This original 1951 version is CLASSIC, and for a reason!"
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"This has some really good acting to it. There was plenty of passion, fear, curiosity, and tension... not to mention hope. The new one has a few down-sides to it and was abit dissappointed."
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"Something you can really enjoy even though its in black and white. Fantastic story, good morale, many thoughts after seeing."
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,The original is still a classic and should be watched before the re-make to appreciate how well told the re-make is.
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,As good as Sci Fi got in the 50's
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,One of the best Science Fiction films of all time.
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"a total classic, kind of stupid they remade this"
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,A Classic. So 1950's and so well done. Stands the test of time.
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,awosome movie to watch bring your friends and family to watch :P
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"Classic flick, set in DC so I really enjoy seeing landmarks of the hometown. Pretty forward-thinking eco message for its time."
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,Still one of the best
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"Amazing plot, great special effects considering when it was made."
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"This version is so much better than the new one. The robot could have been 100 feet tall like the one in the new one, but who am I to decide?"
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,A perfect movie which deserves multiple viewings. Rennie is just right as Klaatu who visits planet Earth to deliver an important message affecting the human existence. Some of the special effects are dated but still an intelligent entry in the sci-fi generation of the '50s.
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,so macht Sci-Fi Spass :)
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,Fuck you Keanu Reeves...
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"The original is always the best. In the case of this movie, one of the best sci-fi films of all time."

1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,One of the greatest sci-fi films of all time. A simple story with a powerful message and meaning. Strongly recommended to everyone...
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,Classic sci-fi movie. I really want to see how hollywood fucks this up with the one.
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"I loved this movie. The supsense was always there, and they never even showed an alien attack, not counting the robot. The acting was great."
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,Quite possibly the best of the 50's allegorical sci-fi classics.
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"An amazing movie that actually took me by surprise. With an ultimatum and a look at human nature, this film kept me glued to the movie. When it finally ended I felt a satisfaction that is felt when a meaningful story ends."
0.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting is okay. The story, characters, cinematography, dialogue, etc. is clumsy and incredibly, incredibly boring."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,A perfect noir thriller
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Jaw dropping timeless film with all around masterful acting, cinematography, direction, story, ect"

1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Thriller policiaco que atrapa desde el primer minuto con un reparto inimitable y una trama que funciona como reloj. Una de las indispensables de Orson Welles, quien destaca en el papel de un policia corrupto."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Film Noir => My Favorite Movie of All Time!!! 12 out of 5 Stars
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"In my humble opinion, Touch of Evil is arguably Orson Welles' directorial masterpiece. Only Chimes at Midnight rivals it."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Orson Welles closed the book on the traditional golden age of Film Noir with Touch of Evil. Aside from the incredibly skilled 3 minute and 20 second long take opening of the film, you also get to witness Charlton Heston play a Mexican! That's worth seeing alone!"
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"""If you are mean enough to steal from the blind, help yourself"""
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Just pure brilliance right from the start. Hypnotic and truly magic. It is films like this that make you believe in cinema as an art form
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,One of the best films of all time.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,One of the greatest films ever! And Orson Welles' best film - better than Citizen Kane. The predecessor of so many movie tropes its a pity so many can only now view it as an amalgamation of cliches.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Otra genialidad de Orson Welles, merece mas que cinco estrellas, con uno de los inicios mas impactantes y de una sola toma hechos en la historia del cine."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"It was Welles' penance. If he could bring it in on time and on budget he would get better choices. Well he did and the studio dumped it. The joke was on them, though, as it's a stunning film."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"OMG, the opening sequence! 'OMG' has finally found its gasp-inducing match. An achievement in every aspect of film-making.Delightful!"
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"As long as you don't find Charlton Heston playing a Mexican too distracting, you're in for quite possibly the most intense psychological thriller of the black-and-white era."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Essential to watch for any serious film fan or filmmaker. Incredible shots and innovative direction bring Orson Wells genius out forefront!
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Uma obra-prima de Orson Welles, mesmo não saindo do jeito que ele planejou (já nessa época os estúdios eram problemáticos), ainda sim é um belo Noir (mesmo abrindo mão alguns elementos tradicionais do gênero) e o emblemático plano-sequência de abertura."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Love Charlton Heston, and Orson Welles' acting is excellent as usual. The shots are killer. It's not that they don't make 'em like they used to, they just don't make 'em like Orson Welles used to."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"An effortlessly stylish, thoughtfully emotional Crime/Thriller/Noir which feels suspiciously like a selection of previously separated narratives, now combined into a glorious affair of wonder for the mind and the eye; each step in the films winding continuation being more captivating than the last."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Personally I believe this to be Welles' best film over Citizen Kane.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Vargas: ""Captain, you won't have any trouble with me.""Quinlan: ""You bet your sweet life I won't."""
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"A policeman's job is only easy in a police state.  This is an amazing film - excellent acting, direction, dialogue - I highly recommend it."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Welles' return marks a new of age of cinema - the painstakingly beautiful cinema.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Touch of Evil defines noir.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Another Orson Welles brigade of artistic mastery and stylish execution. Touch of Evil is suspenseful and intense with a very intriguing story-line.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"a funky film noir, fast"
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Absolutely phenomenal film.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Stylistically pioneering and dramatically riveting, Touch of Evil is a twisted, menacing thriller and a feast for the eyes."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Excellent movie! Watched it because all the low key photography that Wells used. This is a must for photographers/filmographer...
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Probably the best Noir ever, at least, the best I've seen yet."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,LiÃ§Ã£o singular como nÃ£o se deve tratar o espectador como um atrasado mental.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Amazing in every aspect I'd argue and say this is Orson Well's best movie.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Orson Welles at his best. Even Heston's typical overacting cannot prevent this film form being great.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,An amazingly bold film for its time with still a lot of power even in this new century.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Masterpiece - every shot is perfect.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"It has a lot of flaws, but the cinematography and Orson Welles' amazing performance--one of the very best I've ever seen, are enough for me to give it a perfect score anyways."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Hollywood doesn't make films like this anymore because it doesn't produce directors like Orson Welles anymore. Hollywood is dead, but then again, unfortunately so is Welles."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Masterful direction. The king of the B-movies. Plus Charlton Heston as a Mexican!
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Saw the longer, 1998-release version of this (the one Welles intended), and it's fantastic."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Incredible...one of the most suspenseful openings to a movie ever.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,I'm not sure which is better: Orson Welles's performance or his direction.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Oavsett vad Orson Welles ""egentligen"" ville göra så är det här hans bästa film. Mörk, svettig och rå slår den ner som en bomb i vilken filmsoffa som helst."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Better than Citizen Kane? Yes. Obviously. Duh. Why? Where else can you get Heston speaking 'mexican' and with that fantastic fake tan? Janet Leigh being menaced by lesbian bikers? Orson Welles in the greatest fat suit of all time? Dennis Weaver. DENNIS WEAVER.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Have you hear? Welles makes some amazing films. This is one of them.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Welles brilhante como sempre.

1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"A pretty much flawless classic, even though Charlton Heston does play a Mexican."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Another movie made to showcase Orson Welles`s utter brilliance.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"A film noir masterpiece, now restored to Welles' original vision."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,One of my new favorites
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Proof that Orson Welles had other great movies besides Citizen Kane.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Is it possible for Welles to not direct an amazing scene?
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Great Movie. Welles best movie in my opinion. The only problem I had was Charlton Heston playing a Mexican. Once I got over that, the movie was very enjoyable. A must see!"

1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"My introduction to Orson Welles, and it couldn't have been a better one. Welles creates a masterfully executed and hugely entertaining portrait of innocence and abuse of power, presented through strong writing, suspense, convincing acting and of course the legendary opening tracking shot. Memorable."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Brilliant crime movie with some of the most celebrated cinematography ever, it's an intense film for its time."

1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Behind Citizen Kane as my favorite Orson Welles film.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Many say Citizen Kane is Welles' best. I suppose I'm in the minority by saying this is his masterpiece.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Every bit as good Citizen Kane or The Trial. In fact, it's probably more visually interesting than Kane, though the material is trashier and has a bit less depth."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Simply one of the best films ever.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Suspenseful film noir with superb work from Heston, Welles and Leigh."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Disguised as a noir B movie, this is Welles' masterpiece for me, far from ""Citizen Kane""."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"This film is said to have ended film-noir, because it is so dirty and bleak."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Quinlan: Come on, read my future for me. Tanya: You haven't got any. Quinlan: Hmm? What do you mean? Tanya: Your future's all used up."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Meu filme favorito de Orson Welles e um dos melhores films noir da história. Filmado com maestria. O cara brinca com a câmera aqui. Vários 'plano-sequência' épicos. De fato, Orson Welles estava muito à frente de seu tempo, muito."

1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,This film is the real McCoy
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Charlton Heston is a mexican? goes to show how insensative hollywood was back then. But that didn't stop me from liking this movie. An impressive thriller by the great Orson Welles.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Kane was amazing. Ambersons was brilliant, but this is Welles finest film."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Film noir at its darkest. Great opening crane shot. One of Welles best performances. The rest of the outstanding cast also turn in excellent performances.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"While this Welles picture didn't have quite the historical impact of Citizen Kane, for my dollar it's just as entertaining. I still marvel at the technical prowess displayed in that opening sequence."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Fantastic pace and tension throughout, with amazing camera shots and use of lighting."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"many say that ""touch of evil"", not citizen Kane is Welles' finest work. I'd have to agree. the prototype for crooked cop movies."

1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"A stunning portrait of corruption and abuse of power, Touch of Evil gives Orson Welles a broad remit to flourish his directorial genius."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,The finest film noir. Period
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"The genius of Orson Welles!! a masterpiece in film-noir. With or without his huge frame (literally!), Welles towers over this movie with his stunning performance!"

1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"The end of classical noir era and another example of Welles' genius, I must say. Needs to be seen as words can hardly describe. After opening scene/shot, you will realize (or not), what you are dealing with."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Absolute masterpiece. My pick over Citizen Cane.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,An excellent suspense film!
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,By far the greatest thing that Orson Welles has ever done.

1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Really an excellent film, everything from the acting to directing is great, especially since Orson Welles' directing, writing, and performance that blows your mind! Then the six or so minute long shot, come on now, fuckin' amazing."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Best cinematography ever?
0.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"This was an extremely disappointing movie. Uncle Chuck, Janet Leigh, Orson Welles, you'd think it'd be a surefire thing, but damn, it was just boring and bleah."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Note the continuous opening shot that follows the protagonists out of the building, into their car, and around an entire city block in one uncut shot at the beginning of the film. Welles used a crane mounted on a building's roof to accomplish this."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Orson Welles is fucking brilliant

0.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,The first scene: genius. The rest of the film: garbage.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,A terrific film and the perfect way to end the film-noir cycle. Welles' best.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,All of Orson Welles' movies should default to 5 stars.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Not only is this film brilliant on all counts, it's also reason number 2 why Dennis Weaver is one of the all-time underrated acting talents."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Un pur chef-d'oeuvre : le film noir absolu que transcende une mise en scene de genie. La scene du viol vaut largement celle de la douche dans Psychose.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"maybe 2nd best Welles, and yes with Chuck Heston as a Mexican"
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"The opening shot alone is worth buying the movie. Maybe it's a better movie than Citizen Kane, maybe not... apples and oranges. I will say it is probably the best film noir ever made... even with Charlton Heston playing a mexican."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,I still can't believe that's Orson Welles..
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,*the* film noir classic
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Touch of Evil is more impressive than Citizen Kane. His use of the camera instills the perverseness of the story and the characters. The best of film noir.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,best starting plan for a movie. ever. (was for a long time a record: 20 minutes without cut). a masterpiece.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"A very good 'film noir' film with excellent direction and a commanding performance from Welles, its only real flaw is Charlton Heston is cinema's least convincing Mexican."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Only Welles could take a trashy pulp novel and turn it into a piece of art. Genius. And just listen to that dialogue: ""You framed that boy - framed him!"" Classic."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Orson Welles' other best movie.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"For me this film and Citizen Kane stand almost side by side in movie history greatness. A well-crafted film noir of depth and mood directed seemlessly by, if not the greatest, the most important filmmaker in cinema history, Mr. Orson Welles."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,The ultimate Film Noir film. So intense it feels longer than 108 minutes. The best scenes are the beginning and the ending which is ideal for any film. A lot of fun to watch and basically flawless and perfect.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,One of Welles best. A cinematic masterpiece and arguably the last great film noir.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Another masterpiece by Orson Welles that was taken out of his hands. Here we have a murder mystery in which Charlton Heson plays a Mexican narcotics officer and Orson Welles plays a crooked investigator who will do anything to get his way. Janet Leigh is outstanding as Heston's wife.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Aside from the obvious well done writing, editing and shots way ahead of its time, I'd have to say what I enjoyed most was how fat Orson Welles was and how badly ""Mexican"" Charlton Heston looked."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"""What does it matter what people say about you?"""
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,A brilliant film noir. Perhaps not as ground breaking as Citizen Kane but Touch of Evil certainly stands out as one of the best of its kind and once again shows just how great of a writer and director Orson Welles truly is.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"I don't care which cut you see, the original theatrical or the ""director's cut"", just see it. Charlton Heston...as a Mexican! What more could you want?"
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,One of my favorite American made films. I'm in love with Orson.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"I love the story, and I just can't enough of Orson Welles's extraordinary cinematography."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"A superlative work of genius, from its bravura opening to its low-key final shot, this works on all levels, as only truly great films can."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Classic very well thought out - great concept
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Despite a few questionable casting choices, Touch of Evil remains a technical masterpiece and a wonderful example of Welles' fecund imagination. The story starts with a bang and never lets up, perfectly balancing noir influenced abstraction with a sense of gritty reality."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Brilliant. Fast dialogue, dramatic camera angles, Italians playing Mexicans; everything you could ask for in a film."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,One of my favorite movies of all time. The end of the classic noir era as only Orson can do it.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"The late great Welles' seedy,oily B-picture.Full of cinematic touches only the big man could conjure up.Police corruption and brutality down Mexico way...the bravura opening tracking shot...the litter filled grimy streets...the menacing Mercedes Cambridge...Marlene...He vas hellava man!"
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,This movie is just fantastic! Beautiful b/w cinematography and such wonderful odd characters. Unfortunately Welles's rough cut is missing.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,My favourite Orson Welles film
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Another Welles masterpiece. An amazing feat of acting, direction, cinematography, and writing. I liked it the first time through and loved it the second time!"
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Just get past Charlton Heston's poor acting and this film is a masterpiece.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Orson Welles is a genius, as always!"
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,The opening scene goes on forever without a cut.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Truly inspirational film with magnificent acting, grossly gloomy plot, and KICK ASS cinematography way ahead of its time."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,This is one of the great noirs. The newer cut (based on Orson Welles notes) is brilliant.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"""A policeman's job is only easy in a police state."""
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,an absolute masterpiece!
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,gripping and in parts terrifying
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Brilliant....this movie tops any other crime noir film to come from the original wave of noir films. It's dark and gritty and creepy and at times surreal and hallucinatory. How Orson Welles was veritably ignored for the genius that he obviously was in his time is beyond me.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Fantastic movie. The acting is top notch and the directing is fantastic. One sub character that was great was the night porter of the hotel.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,orsen welles is awesome!
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Orson Welles at his best. Brilliant direction and cinematography - the opening scene is a masterpiece. Classic noir - just ignore that Charlton Heston is supposed to be Mexican...
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Incredible film that feels like it should have been made in the 70s or 80s with the themes discussed.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Mesmerizing camera work is the most immediate feature of this Orson Welles production. Like Citizen Kane, the heart of this story is the unraveling of a powerful figure (in this case, a police detective). This is a smart film that creates uncomfortable situations with great skill."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,In my opinion Welles best directorial display. The first sequence is the best sequence in film ever. A classic noir film with all the best elements. Superb
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"now, this is a true B&W; movie... no guessing around"
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Quite possibly my favorite film of all time, a film that often makes me cry because it is just such a monumental artisitc acheivement."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Ultimativ medrivende krimi, hvor man hele tiden bliver i tvivl om, hvem man skal holde med. Fantastisk åbningsscene hvor kameraet i ét langt skud følger hovedpersonens bil ved grænseovergangen indtil.."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Great film! Go watch it! Orson Welles is awesome!
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Suspend disbelief enough to allow Charlton Heston to play a Mexican detective, and you will be able to enjoy one of my all-time favorite noir thrillers. This film grabs you with its spectacular first tracking shot (filmed as one long, continuous take) and never lets go."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Pelicula de fronteras: Mexico-USA, Cielo-Infierno, Dia-Noche, Amor-Odio. El son de una pianola y el ""adios"" de la Dietrich me alcanzan para saber de q lado estoy yo. Gracias Orson por tanta magia."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Wow. A Film Noir powerhouse!
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,The opening shot in this film is one of the best I've ever seen.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,My review is based off the re-cut version. I thought it was directed brilliantly with such confidence and expertise.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Orson Welles is a filmmaking master. That is all.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"My all-time favorite Orson Welles movie. Sure, it has Charlton Heston playing a Mexican with an American accent, but otherwise it works."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Cracking good noir entertainment.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Charlton Heston plays a Mexican detective, and does a good acting job. Two feats never to be repeated in cinematic history, to my knowledge."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Very amazing movie... good for watching over and over again.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Haunting latter-day film-noir from Orson Welles, who is unquestionably one of the all-time great actors AND directors. Chartlon Heston and Janet Leigh and both surprisingly good, too."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,uggghhhhh... nana nana.

1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,This crazy movie is one of the milestones of noir genre!
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,The definitive film noir
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Citizen Kane or Touch of Evil. Which is a better movie? Do we ever have to decide?
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Only Orson Welles could make a masterpiece out of a film starring Charlton Heston as a Mexican cop.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,This movie shook me the first time i saw it. Not already the 60's but you are going to see some extreme sequence there. A group of junkies try to rape and give drug to a pregnant woman that after wake up in a bed with a dead man staring over her.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"A jolt to the system. This movie reminds me so much of great moments I'd seen in Repulsion or Mean Streets or Blue Velvet, except it came first."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,We'll miss you Chuck
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"the now deceased Heston as a Mexican? WHAT? but seriously, a movie that jumps into frame with a bomb being planted in a convertible truck and features a scantily clad, drugged up Janet Lee chained to bed can't be all bad....actually it's AWESOME!"
0.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,sooo shocked at how bad it was
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Spectacular. The film that ended the film noir era. I find it to be more entertaining that 'Citizen Kane', but it's not as transcendent due to genre conventions How can you go wrong with Welles in a massive fatsuit? RIP Charlton Heston."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,The director's cut is the superior edition. This is one of Welles' best films for so many reasons. Charlton Heston as a Mexican!
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Uno de los grandes policiales de la historia, y la mejor pelicula de Orson Welles en mi opinion... (me cago en ti, Ciudadano Kane). Ah, es el ultimo film noir clasico..."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,An amazing nior with possibly the best opening scene of any movie ever. Just breath taking!

1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Orson Welles is brilliant. just brilliant.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,this guy is openly the greatest genius of the last century. A modern leonardo da vinci.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,No Kane but an exciting and well executed flick with plenty of nifty cinematography and some good character
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Orson Welles at his best. Even Heston's typical overacting cannot prevent this film form being great.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Cine negro del weno, Orson Welles rules!!"
0.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,I HATE orson wells! and this is perhaps his worse story! the guy and his stories are just... disturbing. and definitely not in a good way.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Flixster describes this as the greates B movie ever made. It's actually one of the greatest movies ever made. period. This is how film noir is supposed to look.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,One of the GREATEST film noir's I have seen... And has the best tracking shot in a film until Goodfellas. Amazing cast and Charlton Heston playing a Mexican is a must see!
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"I love this movie. This movie is perhaps the best noir movie ever made. The long opening shot is a real treat. The preformances suprise. It is almost a who is who of the era. Orson Welles as the slimy, always sweaing, overweight cop is incredible."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Orsons is brilliant as usual, but maybe even more in this film...They forgot to mention Marlene Dietrich as gypsy in the cast"
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,I thought it was better than Citizen Kane?
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Most adtÃ¡k a tÃ©vÃ©ben a Welles tiltakozÃ³ memoranduma alapjÃ¡n ÃºjravÃ¡gott vÃ¡ltozatot. A filmjei kÃ¶zÃ¼l az Ambersonok Ã©s A per mellett nekem ez tetszett leginkÃ¡bb.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,A masterpiece! Nothing more needs to be said.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Excellent from the opening long tracking shot to Marlene Dietrich's final piece of dialogue. The only low point for me is the irritating jumpy motel nightwatchman, but that is nitpicking. An enthralling, and visually superior, film noir."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Very clever film noir. Welles basically showing off his unfair talent in this one.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Proof that Welles exemplifies the height of craft. Not the best screen story ever told, but maybe one of the best-told screen stories ever."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Orson Wells and Charlton Heston....Nuff Said!!!
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,One of the best movies ever...

1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,A stunning movie visually and accompanied by a great story. I have also never seen a Director have so much fun with his camerawork in terms of story telling and pacing. Just perfect. The acting of Welles will also haunt my dreams.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Forget all the talk of the opening tracking shot. A great film. A great film noir. Track down the un-restored cut to see the difference. Great stuff.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,unbelievable!!!! b.quain

1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Wonderfully atomspheric noir film. The opening pan shot is amazing and sets up the feel of the entire movie. Welles is deliciously disgusting is his role.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Dark and enticing film noir classic.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,My favorite of Orson Welles' films
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Orson Welle's best acting in any film and the epitomy of what film noir is all about. Gritty and compelling. It also has perhaps the best opening long shot of any film ever made.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Star filled and well played film even if Orson Welles had problems with Universal during production this is a masterpiece of a grim film. The ironic ending still is extremely effective.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Dirk and Dane and Nana just completely didn't like this at all. They were pretty vocal about that.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Classic conspracy twist film. Not only the best of its genre but one of the greatest films of all time.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Took him the best part of 20 years but Welles finally makes a film that can sit alongside 'Kane' as a masterpiece!
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Orson Welles got really fat in a very short amount of time.

1.0,dr_strangelove,"So realistic and valid to contemporaneity times when despots in the penchant for nuclear arms. Ludicrous to the highest degree, thus effective in the message, it wants to convey. If it's shown worldwide in 2017 that sure will make a universal upheaval against nuclear arms."

0.0,dr_strangelove,This film could have been cut down to twenty minutes and still kept it's whole story. They could have cut out Dr. Strangelove and it wouldn't effect the film. I mean he was only in it for ten minutes tops. It wasn't funny to me but that's opinionated.

1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,One of the best movies dealing with men coming home from WWII. It is well acted and full of heart.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,A candid look at the struggles of veterans returning from the battlefields of World War II.

1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,I just discovered this movie and it was awesome.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"Interesting to see how most people thought about war vets in 1946.

Highly recommended."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"A TRUE MASTERPIECE, as relevant today as when it was released."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"You can toss aside old tanks, old aircraft and old guns....but not old soldiers. Thsi well made, beautifully acted film is of teh harsh reailities of what happens to good men after wars are fought and won. One of the top 20 films of all-time."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"Great movie, even if some of the conventions are totally dated (a soft light bulb magically appears above a woman's face whenever there's anything romantic going on). I also liked how you get to see what America looked like in the mid-40s. I recommend it."

1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"Man, this movie sticks with me. Simple stories well told of veterans and their families finding their way after the war is over. William Wyler again (also directed the equally excellent Dodsworth) pulls great performances out of a large ensemble cast. Movies the way they should be..."

1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,Saw this many years ago but just recently re-experienced this tremendous film. Remarkable perspective for its time with Wyler's unique way of creating visual impact with his camera shots along with amazing performances.

1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,Ground breaking. Vicious and heart breaking. Ten times more brutal then Coming Home which came out 40 years later.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,WAsn't to sure what to expect thought it would be preachy propaganda about how rosy life is after people get out of the war. Glad to see that it wasn't the case with this movie.

1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"Beautiful, sentimental classic. I love this movie. I watch it again and again. (I have a thing for Dana Andrews anyway.) How it avoided being sappy/sticky I can't really understand, but it does. I really loved the relationship between Fredric March and Myrna Loy. We should all be so lucky in love!"
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"As long as there will be wars, this movie will remain timeless."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"I consider this to be one of the best war movies that I have ever seen, since it does not focus on the battles. Every part of this movie is amazingly done and it had more of an effect on me than war films that show the brutality of the battlefield."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"William Wyler's best film is post-war classic telling story of American verterans returning home and readapting to life. Brilliant performances and superb direction, not to mention excellent cinematography from the master of deep-focus, Greg Toland."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"Really, utterly fantastic. I wish I could single out certain members of the cast for their performances, but they were all such standouts that I can't do it in good conscience. Good job (again), William Wyler."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,Amazing. Great movie about WW2 vets coming home. It is a Hollywood twist on Italian neo-realist movies and pulls it off quite well. Harold Russell does a great job acting as a non-professional actor (only appeared in two TV cameo roles later in life). This movie is perfect.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,Incredible and deeply moving.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"A priceless treasure from the post WWII amercian production. This brings to the screen a very emotional play but in a very subtle manner, suggesting feelings of human despair and deep friendship rather than displaying them. Simply beautiful."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,What a GREAT movie. War heros coming home and how they adapt to getting back to 'normal life'. What an amazing film!!
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,great storytelling...content...craft...cinema
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"I laughed (at March), I cried, it became a part of me. Really. Wyler keeps it wonderfully low-key, which lets the movie hold up 60 years later. Beautiful continuous takes from Gregg Toland (one of his last films before his untimely death)."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,A much better movie than you're expecting. It was really great by any standard.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,I cry every time I see this shockingly contemporary movie.Myrna Loy and Teresa Wright destroy the screen with their performances. Harold Russell as homer parish and the Amazing Fredrich March and Dana Andrews are all fantastic.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,A film deeply invested in the people it depicts. Its love for them is humbling. As good a melodrama as I can remember seeing.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"This is the movie that made me fall in love with classic Hollywood. It is honest, funny, heartwarming and moving. Perfect."

1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,I recommend this to all.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,The first film to deal with the post-war experience of returning veterans. Everyone shines in this film that deserves a Top 10 slot on any legitimate American film list. Harold Russell puts on a performance that really cuts one in two. An example of great writing.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,A brave look at how WWII vets fared (or didn't) after 1945. Compelling performances complment Robert Sherwood's wonderful script.

1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,A true classic in every sense. 3 war veterans return from Europe to find how much their lives back home have changed. Few movies really tap into family and romantic dynamics as well as this film does. A must see.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"a resolute classic that's still relevant in today's society. this film avoids the tendency toward trite and overbearing notions, while successfully achieving a deep sentimentality. a compelling, heartfelt example of the best in early american movie-making."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"I haven't seen this in a while, but I remember thinking it was five stars, so here it is. I really love this movie and it amazing me that the handicap man could win an Oscar and this was his first movie."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,This is a groundbreaking movie because it portrays WW2 veterans returning home and trying to resume their lives. The film follows three story lines which are all equally compelling. This is a true American classic.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"Yep, it doesn't take long for this one to reduce even the hardest of hearts into a heap of molten muscle."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,One of my favorite movies of all time.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"This one beat out ""It's a Wonderful Life"" at the Oscars in 1947, and with good reason: it's a much better film. Entirely worth seeing. You've seen war films, but when have you seen a great post-war film?"
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,sad but true. deer hunter has a similar but less effective poignancy. really nice ending.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"Great performances, directing and a story that resonates with audiences even today"

1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"Frederic March for the win!!! Harold Russel is delightfully heartbreaking as well, and I love the fish out of water feel, as well as the class distinction between the primaries: upper, middle, and lower. I could go on, and on, and on- but I won't."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,from start to finish- one of the best movies ever made
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,The greatest film of William Wyler's career with superb performances all around.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"Awesome, awesome movie. One opf the very few that took a deep look into the GI ""boys"" that came back from WWII to find a whole new world. YOu are right. Things don't change. Bit no one wanted to tell that story back then. Courageous film"

1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"Excellent movie. 1946 or 2007, people are the same."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,This is the finest movie about war veterans coming home and finding that life will never be the same for them and how they adjust to that. Excellent acting and very poignant.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,Can't believe I neve saw this before. Made me think of what my dad went through when he got back from WWII with no family and no home to come back to.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"They don't make quality films like this anymore. It covers some pretty heavy issues, and despite its age, it is still relevant today."

1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,Best drama of all time bar none. I watch it anytime I need a lift
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"That a movie of this depth was made only a year after the end of WWII only underscores how great it is. Deep, powerful, soulful, redemptive."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,Such an AMAZING movie...a definate classic

I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,An amazing and entirely unsentimental look at veterans returning home from World War II.

1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"A wonderfully accurate portrayal of what it was like to come back from war,and realize that you and those you left behind have changed, although many other parts of your life remained at a standstill. I also enjoyed Hoagy Carmichael's small but integral part in this fantastic movie."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"This movie is just so great on many levels. It's one of those rare films that shows life beyond the battlefield. There are three story lines, interwoven, with three different points of view."

1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,Wonderful film. Everyone should see it at least once.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"Amazing film, in every aspect."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"The kind of movie not often see, where soldiers returning from war go through a period of adjustment that often goes unmentioned. Very moving and well-acted."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,if I had the money I would buy Harold Russell's (multi-amputee Homer) the academy award he won and give it back 2 him.. (he sold it 2 pay 4 bills) mind u he's never acted b4 or after this film!
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"Ah, the pastoral life of post-war America. Or, maybe not. This quiet, moving portrait follows the painful adjustment both soldiers and their families had to make at the end of WWII."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,I saw only about 3/4th of this film but it is AWESOME
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"Pyschologically and historically surpirsing. Revealed that even the ""Good War"" had left its veterans high and dry with the emotional and physical help they needed."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"THE ultimate William Wyler film. 3 hours long, but worth every minute!"
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"Sentimental, filled with cliches, and overlong, but filled with an earnest feeling that helps truly examine what veterans had to go through upon coming back. This movie truly shows that actual combat is only the beginning of the consequences of a war."

1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"An honest account of how three soldiers cope with the re-intergration into society. Blunt, honest and a real insight into the trauma that serviceman suffer from adjusting to a civilian life."
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,So much cheese but its so good!
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"Amazing film, especially when you consider it was made so close to the end of the war.

1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,Incrdible filmmaking from Post-War Hollywood.
1.0,best_years_of_our_lives,"Great movie, especially considering the year in which it was made.

1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,The best film you could possibly watch on a bank holiday afternoon. There isn't a false note in all its 312 minutes and O'Tooles performance is one of the greatest in all cinema.
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,"Greatest movie I've ever seen. Epic on so many level; vision, scope and meaning of the story."
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,One of the best of the late golden age epics. The hero is rather unconventional. That and the cinematography give the movie a grand scale.
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,Great cast and one of my all time favorites. A true Epic! Highly recommended
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,I'll admit I got bored at times. But the cinematography is incredible. And it was incredible for 4 hours.
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,"Lawrence captivates and mesmerizes. Truly, a man riding the wings of inspiration, trapped on a fine line between child and god. A man who sought sanity by exploring the depths of his own insanity. A man with a mind like the desert, vast, beautiful, and deadly."
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,Just watched this again in HD and it looks amazing. Also Obi-Wan Kanobi is plays an Arab prince in this......So it has to be good!
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,"One of the best films ever made. If you don't like it, you have bad taste."
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,David Lean directs one of the greatest movies in history truly epic starring Peter O' Toole in the role he was born to play.
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,I love the scenery. Peter O'Toole is Magnificent.
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,"Peter O'Toole in the role of a lifetime, and the shoe fits. Powerful acting across the board in this film, and the scenery is starkly beautiful."

1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,gives Ben-Hur and run for its money
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,A sweeping epic both in scope and execution. The visuals are sumptuous and the writing is of the highest order. Daring but subtle. Intense but never over-the-top. Contemplative but never boring. This is one of the best films ever made.
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,Perhaps the finest example of cinematography. Lean's best and one of my all time favorites.
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,The very definition of EPIC!  Wow!  Grade: A+

1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,"Truly, truly great epic."
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,"I shall watch Orance of Arabia again, but it's length makes that hard to do in one sitting. On the other hand, it's amazing that such a long film is able to captivate and truly entertain you throughout it's duration."
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,One of the best movies of all time.
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,"Great movie, one of the best epic ever to grace the screen. Lawrence's growth on screen keeps the audience occupied , his humor, grief, horrendous acts and others make him more human and still a legend."
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,"As an aspiring filmmaker, film historian and film critic, Lawrence of Arabia is the greatest film ever made. Grade; A+ + + +"
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,"This is one amazing film, and the people who gave it negative reviews and calling it overrated should get eaten by a T-rex because they don't realize the epicness of this movie."
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,"The greatest epic film to date, David Lean creates a cautivating and magical tale that stands the test of time, featuring fantastic performances from all of its cast, especially from Peter O'Tool and Omar Shariff. My appreciation to this film is 97/100, rounded to 100."
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,In my top three movies (and I forget what the other two are!)
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,The second greatest film ever made and the best Epic.
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,"An true epic. From the stunning cinematography to Peter O'Toole's great performance to the fantastic story, Lawrence of Arabia excels in every aspect. The only problem is the length, though it fills every second of that time with something amazing. An awe inspiring film."
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,"One of the most influential, epic, moving, and understanding war films that I have ever seen. It shows the value of innocence and how war will tear that innocence apart so easily. This is one of the best films ever to be made."
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,"The film that David Lean and Peter O'Tool will no doubt be remembered for; it's a mysterious wonder that doesn't grow dated, and treats the protagonist as a human, instead of a contemporary movie hero."
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,I thought sharif Ali was hot when I was 11 :D
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,One of the best films ever made. It's an amazing work of art.

1.0,chinatown,"A part of me remains on the couch I first watched it on, rewatching it has become ritualistic and profound."
1.0,chinatown,"Chinatown is as beautiful and lucid as any old school thriller before it, and as such doesn't vie for the darkness of noir and cheapness of neo-noir, but in substitution lets Polanski construct an unprecedented original."

1.0,chinatown,"It is well know that Chinatown is the greatest neo-noir ever made, but it is the unpopular opinion that it may just be the greatest film ever made. While I don't quite believe this, I do believe that Chinatown is in the ranks of Citizen Kane, The Godfather, and Casablanca. Chinatown is a masterpiece"
1.0,chinatown,"amaaaaazing movie , one of the best i've ever watched it's just perfect with the twists , the screenplay and i really liked that nicholson is in every scene"

1.0,chinatown,+ ...epitome of Hollywood.
1.0,chinatown,"Bold and brilliant. roman polanski's mistery masterpiece its an attractive,entertaining and powerful film-noir story. Great directing,script (perhaps one of the most brilliant ever on screen), strong performances and a magnificent,tour-de-force,shocking ending."

1.0,chinatown,"An excellent, classic film that is suspenseful, well-filmed, and features enjoyable twists and turns. Jack Nicholson is terrific--as usual."
1.0,chinatown,A brilliant noir throwback that never let's up. Jack Nicholson is as good as he always is.
1.0,chinatown,"A very powerful film with excellent screenplay, directing, story, and top-notch performances from Dunaway and Nicholson. In my humble opinion, definitely a must-watch, even if you don't like Roman Polanski."
1.0,chinatown,Neo Noir Masterpiece.
1.0,chinatown,"This 1974 film directed by Polansky is one of the greatest expressions of the neo noir films. An excellent screenplay and a portentous performance of Jack Nicholson. Moreover, without having a happy end it makes more admirable."
1.0,chinatown,"""Chinatown"" is relentlessly pessimistic, and not just in the ending . . . its probably the definitive Neo-Noir. We should all be grateful Polanski forcibly altered the finale to what it is now because anything else would be unacceptable."
1.0,chinatown,"A film that gets better with every viewing, and showcases the talents of everybody involved."
1.0,chinatown,"One of the darkest, most stylish films ever made. May be a bit slow for casual viewers but there is a lot of special in this strange cocktail of decadence and grit."

1.0,chinatown,"Incredible film, Nicholson at his very best."
1.0,chinatown,A masterpiece of noir cinema.
1.0,chinatown,"Fantastic performances from both Nicholson & Dunaway, an absolute classic."
1.0,chinatown,Great noir. Must see. Jack at his best.
1.0,chinatown,"Jack Nicholson plays arguably his best role (yes, better than The Shining) and Roman Polanski directs a near perfect masterpiece of a film that borrows from Hitchcock and other noir aficionados."
1.0,chinatown,One of the most entertaining films of all time. The film super glues you to the screen and once the film ends you'll be yearning for side stories from the brutally shady & unpredictable chinatown of the 1930's. You'll also wish there were a JJ Gittes comic book/animated series. So good.
1.0,chinatown,"Well, Roman Polanski is probably my favorite director. This is a movie is unlike any of his other works. This really is a masterpiece, like most of his films before this one. I guess that's Roman Polanski for you."
1.0,chinatown,"Masterpiece, as I'm sure you all know."
1.0,chinatown,"In spite of what Gene Siskel says, the production design and the composition of the frames are by no means contrived. Instead we have a film that is tremendous from start to finish striking a perfect balance between noir homages and originality."

1.0,chinatown,What a great movie. I can't believe I've lived in LA for 20 years and am now just seeing it. Such a great looking film.
1.0,chinatown,"A tribute to film noir in color. A great caper with multiple mysteries to solve. Endlessly copied. Eccentric performances from the three leads will keep your attention. The ending feels abrupt and unsatisfying every time I watch it, but I guess that's the point, the tragedy of it."
1.0,chinatown,"Flawless, classic Noir film. Bleak, tragic, and amazing."

1.0,chinatown,Just about as good as a movie gets. Excellent from top to bottom
1.0,chinatown,"Jack Nicholson, often known for going over the top (The Shining, Batman) gives a very controlled and low-key performance in this deliberately-paced neo noir film under the masterful direction of Roman Polanski. Anyone who likes film noir needs to see this film."
1.0,chinatown,"In the another universe, Chinatown and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest won around 10 academy awards. One of the awards are Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and Screenplay."
1.0,chinatown,Love this movie. It starts off strange and just gets weirder and weirder without getting distracted from the main plotline. Some of Nicholson's best work (before he got typecast in the 80s) and definitely Polanski's masterpiece.
1.0,chinatown,great movie.. the end was great
1.0,chinatown,Flat out one of the best movies ever made.

1.0,chinatown,"It hooks you from start to finish without an ounce of boredom in between. I loved this film so much, I won't even hesitate to say that it should have won Best Picture in 1974. I consider this to be Polanski's greatest film to date, and one of the all time greatest movies."

1.0,duck_soup,"Story doesn't matter at all to the Marx brothers but it is a good excuse to film some of the most absurd and entertaining antics to ever grace the screen. Nothing but constant gags and yes, the famous 'mirror' scene is pretty damn funny."
1.0,duck_soup,Humor has its pinnacle; it's known as Duck Soup.
1.0,duck_soup,"I take back everything bad I've ever said about the Marx Brothers. This has gotta be the boldest, most ridiculous and manic, and most ahead of its time piece of comedy of the first half of the 20th century, with W.C. Fields' Never Give a Sucker an Even Break really being its only competition."
1.0,duck_soup,"They are all wonderful, but this under-rated Marx Brothers classic out-shines them all! Brilliantly chaotic and hilarious!"

1.0,duck_soup,My favorite Marx Brothers movie of all time. Duck Soup is as fresh today as it was in 1933. Hilarious and a great anti war movie. Every politician needs to see it so they can see how ridiculous war is. The brothers at their best.
1.0,duck_soup,"A comedy classic! The best feature from the brothers Marx, in which Groucho plays the leader of Fredonia and declares war on a neighboring country simply because he can. Remarkable humor. This week watch one of the best laugh-fests ever conceived on film."

1.0,duck_soup,"Gentlemen, Chicolini here may talk like an idiot, and look like an idiot, but don't let that fool you: he really is an idiot."
1.0,duck_soup,One of the funniest movies ever made. There's not a moment that isn't comedy gold. Grocho Marx is king of the one liners.
1.0,duck_soup,"the marx brothers' top movie; no love story, all the songs are ridiculous, and the final montage is absurd perfection.""i was by my husband's side up until his final breath.""""no wonder he passed away."" - rufus t. firefly"

1.0,duck_soup,One of the funniest Marx Bros. films. More jokes and more gags and much less singing...and when there is singing it's pretty funny too! Perhaps their finest.

1.0,duck_soup,"I love Duck Soup. I really think I would use the word ""love."""
1.0,duck_soup,Another one I watched many times with my grandma. I never knew how hilarious Groucho truly was. Harpo has always been my favorite. These guys had the idea of the comedy team down perfectly.
1.0,duck_soup,"Non-stop laughs, its the Marx Brothers at their finest."
1.0,duck_soup,"Marx brothers at their most unbridled & brilliantly funny. I prefer ""Night at the Opera"" for it's classic comic structure, but this is truly their best work."
1.0,duck_soup,La tramoya de los sombreros le levanta el ánimo a cualquiera
1.0,duck_soup,This is such a funny movie. A real classic. Family Guy just spoofed the mirror scene on their last episode.
1.0,duck_soup,With the possible exception of Modern Times and City Lights this is the best comedy ever made. It's definitely the most anarchic and savagely hillarious talkie (although Dr. Strangelove comes close). The Three Stooges are the Marx Brothers without the brains or wit.
1.0,duck_soup,"""¿Sabe que no ha parado de hablar desde que llegó? ¿Qué ocurre? ¿La vacunaron con la aguja de un tocadiscos?"""

1.0,duck_soup,"This movie was so entertaining, so now it's on my favorite movies list. I like the comedy, and the Marx Brothers, Harpo being my favorite <3 they just don't do comedies like this one anymore, and it just wouldn't work if they did either."
1.0,duck_soup,So hystarical with such a witty script. The Mark Brothers perfectly execute this witty and smart film. The undertone of war is quite political as well
1.0,duck_soup,Just about the funniest movie ever made.
1.0,duck_soup,Pure anarchy and genius.
1.0,duck_soup,"How to sum up a movie from 1933? History repeats it self, so make sure you see it. Perfect."

1.0,duck_soup,"the mirror scene is classic! general:war would mean a prohibited increase in our taxes chicolini:hey, i got an uncle who lives in taxes!! general:nooo. im talking about taxes, money, dollars. chicolini:dollars! that's where my uncle lives dollars, taxes!!!"
1.0,duck_soup,What can you say it's the Marx Brothers at their best.
1.0,duck_soup,One of their funniest!
1.0,duck_soup,"By far the best film the Marx Brothers ever made (only Horse Feathers and A Night At the Opera come close). Not just that, it's also a sure-fire candidate for the greatest comedy of all time. If you're a Marx Brothers novice, this is definitely the right film to begin with."
1.0,duck_soup,My favorite Marx Brothers' movie. It is also the first one of them I watched in my life. I guess that's why it is so special to me.
1.0,duck_soup,"The Marx Brothers at their anarchic best. ""All God's Chillun Got Guns""! This movie makes me howl from beginning to end."

1.0,duck_soup,I HEART the Marx Bros. so much. It is hard to believe that they made absolutely hilarious movies during the depression.
1.0,duck_soup,"OLD SCHOOL to the max. this movie is extremely funny for anyone silly whos REALLY willing to give old movies from completely different times a chance. and yes, despite the lack of harpo playing the harpo, it is the marx brothers best, and we can finally say goodbye to Zeppo after this one"
1.0,duck_soup,"My favorite Marx Brothers film. Where the world is familiar with the simple humor of The Three Stooges, it's a shame it can't be more familiar with the far more intelligent (and more funny) and often pointed humor of the Marx Brothers."
1.0,duck_soup,An indisputable comedy classic. Groucho's rapid fire dialogue perfectly compliments Harpo and Chico's physical brand of mayhem. This collection of antics simply cannot be ignored.

1.0,duck_soup,"The best Marx Brothers movie of all time, which pretty much makes it the funniest movie ever."

1.0,duck_soup,Groucho... politics... comedy... genious!
1.0,duck_soup,"Inspired hilarity and nonsense every second. Marx Brothers movies obviously don't need a plot that makes any sense when they have ridiculously funny non-stop gags working for them. The Marx Brothers have influenced many comedy troupes today, most notably Stella."

1.0,duck_soup,Genius. Pure and simple. So good it is crispy fresh as the day it was made.

1.0,duck_soup,Best Marx Bros. movie. Period.
1.0,duck_soup,"Absolutely amazing and one of the funniest movies EVER made! Every character was hilarious, the situations seem a little off context but that makes them funny.

1.0,duck_soup,always...always makes me laugh
1.0,duck_soup,Classic comedy from the Marx Brothers. There are many set-pieces but the highlight has to be the scene where Groucho and Harpo are checking each other out in the mirror scene. Fantastic belly laughs all the way

1.0,duck_soup,WHAT?! You mean people with brains once wrote comedies?
1.0,duck_soup,"Probably the most brilliant political satire that was never *completely* meant to be a brilliant political satire. As Groucho once said when asked what the political message was in the film: ""Message? What message? We were just four Jews trying to get a laugh."" THAT is genius - just laugh."
1.0,duck_soup,They don't make them like this anymore..
1.0,duck_soup,"How on Earth to I begin to describe my utter love affair with the Marx Brothers? Can anyone name one film that not only propels a story, but also maintains a comedic zany magnitude of epic proportions like ""Duck Soup"" does? One of the best comedy films ever made!"
1.0,duck_soup,Made for multiple viewings. Something new everytime.
1.0,duck_soup,"The Marx Bros movies are the ideal comedies. They weren't sniffing coke, they weren't having sex all the time, and they weren't using the f word all the time. Today, all we have are raunchy comedies filled with sex jokes, drugs, and cursing."

1.0,duck_soup,"Easily the most entertaining of all Marx Bros. movies, and of all movies period, Duck Soup featured comedy routines that are now staples--and, in fact, requirements--of any comedy-lover's library. No comedian's training or history is complete without viewing this seminal classic."

1.0,the_gold_rush,"For the Blackadder fans who agree Chaplin is unfunny and untalented, I suggest they watch this marvel. A movie gem that delights, cheers and demonstrates the sheer brilliance of the first icon of cinema. Unlike today's so-called 'comedy greats' (which are complete frauds) this man is the real thing."

1.0,the_gold_rush,"Now I admit that the only version of The Gold Rush movie I have seen is the 1942 version which is Charlie Chaplin re-edited and did a voice over narration. Even Chaplain considered the 1942 version as superior to the original. But eventually I will watch the original version, just not right now."
1.0,the_gold_rush,"Some things about Chaplin and his ""Gold Rush"" are the ability to conceive nostalgia and to express human feelings without saying a word; things that, along with the well synchronized story tracking, turned this film into a transcendental classic."
1.0,the_gold_rush,"A thoroughly entertaining comedy, as well as a great exploration of what it means to ""strike it rich"". Not only is Chaplin timeless, he proves that he can be better with limitations than a lot of current directors are without them."
1.0,the_gold_rush,"Probably one of the best film to ever hit the screens, this awesome comedy by legendary Charles Chaplin is very funny, well done, smart and touching. A complete treasure from the early time of cinema. A film that deserves to be rediscovered by new generations. Masterpiece."

1.0,the_gold_rush,"Obra maestra de Chaplin, en la que interpreta a un solitario buscador de oro que llega a Alaska, a principios de siglo, en busca de fortuna. Una fuerte tormenta de nieve le llevará a refugiarse en la cabaña de un bandido. En 1942 fue reestrenada en versión sonora."
1.0,the_gold_rush,charlie chaplin. what else.
1.0,the_gold_rush,Fantastic and classic tale from Charlie Chaplin in his Little Tramp persona. One of the all time greats right here.
1.0,the_gold_rush,Chaplin nÃÂ£o poderia ser mais claro e eficiente sobre as mudanÃÂ§as e distorÃÂ§ÃÂµes em que a sociedade e as pessoas vivem: Come-se o sapato e se usam os pÃÂ£es como sapato.
1.0,the_gold_rush,Rediscovering Chaplin through these Criterion editions has reawakened the pure joy I had in 8th grade trying to find out everything about this great man. Such melancholy and happiness has never been melded like this. Perfection.
1.0,the_gold_rush,"The Gold Rush is a comedy with flashes of art, tragedy, love, interrelated with coarseness and rowdiness."
1.0,the_gold_rush,Classic Chaplin. 'Nuff said.

1.0,the_gold_rush,What a way to end the era of silent movie.Thank you Charlie.
1.0,the_gold_rush,"But the bottom line is that The Gold Rush is still funny after almost eighty years, and that's a feat few comedies in any year can ever accomplish. Chaplin, in his ability to extract maximum humor and poignancy from his material, has no equivalent today. What a shame."
1.0,the_gold_rush,Watched a Charlie Chaplin movie after a long time and loved it!
1.0,the_gold_rush,"I liked the movie.. He made me laugh from my heart.. about Georgia, his love, she's a slut"

1.0,the_gold_rush,"Why was I surprised that this was anything less than brilliant? This movie doesn't need color, CGI special effects, 3D, or yes, talking. It has quite possibly the greatest tragi-comic actor of all time. And here he is in all his genius. Amazing!!"
1.0,the_gold_rush,I'm a big Charlie Chaplin fan and this one of my favorite CC movies.

1.0,the_gold_rush,so many classic moments
1.0,the_gold_rush,"The best of Chaplin's ""little tramp"" films in my estimation, this film is equal parts humor, emotion and slapstick. I think one of my favorite moments is his ""dance of the dinner rolls"", simply classic. If you're going to sit down to just one chaplin film, make it this one."
1.0,the_gold_rush,"After all these years, this is the first complete CC movie I've seen!! Epic! good humor made real!"
1.0,the_gold_rush,"Another hilarious Chaplin classic. Full of joy and laughter watchng this film with lots of very rememberable scenes like the eating of his shoe, the cabin on the edge of the mountain and the roll dance. Simple story with so much to add for the film."
1.0,the_gold_rush,The best Chaplin movie in my opinion :)
1.0,the_gold_rush,"It's unique. The comedy and the reality about the history walk together in a brilliant narrative. After City Lights, my favorite Chaplin's film."

1.0,the_gold_rush,"Chaplin is a genius in his 1925 movie, in which he starred in, directed, produced, and composed music for. ""The Gold Rush"" is a heartwarming silent film, that will reel in new fans for Chaplin every time. This lovable story proves that good guys don't finish last, and love conquers all."
1.0,the_gold_rush,All I can say is... if you haven't seen it... SEE IT!!!!
1.0,the_gold_rush,"Simply extraordinary and very, very funny. One of Chaplin's finest films. Features the classic bread roll dance & shoe eating sequences.For anyone looking for genuine originality in this era of remakes & re-imaginings, this is a good place to start."

1.0,the_gold_rush,"Clasico de la comedia y de la filmografia de Chaplin que incluye el inmortal (y doloroso) sketch del zapato, la transformacion de Chaplin en pollo y el baile de los panecillos. Obligatoria para cualquier fanatico del cine."
1.0,the_gold_rush,Uma comédia com poucos adversários na história do cinema.
1.0,the_gold_rush,Worth five stars for the roll dance scene alone. Perhaps not the best Tramp-movie but it still rates at the top. The narration underlines how unnecessary it really is -- one understands almost everything without it. Now that's communication!
1.0,the_gold_rush,"I unwittingly rented the 1943 version which was great. I think the silent one is probably better, but you can't really ruin this classic. An amazing film that generations of comedians and films have tried to replicate."

1.0,the_gold_rush,"For those who believe all Chaplin did was those little 5 minute shorts before the main feature when we were kids, you'll see this movie is full of pathos and poignancy that makes you realise his greatness. He was one of the true geniuses of the 20th century."
1.0,the_gold_rush,"Very enjoyable, smart plot, funny and brilliant!"
1.0,the_gold_rush,"Chaplin cpatures our hearts by putting the tramp up against the dangers of nature itself, and the pains of love."

1.0,the_gold_rush,Chaplin makes me laugh out loud! I love him.
1.0,the_gold_rush,"Although I didn't enjoy it as much as some of his shorts (particularly Easy Street), It's still a great film, and just a small part of Chaplin's revolution of the cinema."
1.0,the_gold_rush,"Gee, i almost die laughing"
1.0,the_gold_rush,Chaplin did more without sound than the majority of directors around today do with sound.
1.0,the_gold_rush,"Saw the 1942 re-release with the added narration. The addition seems to work surprisingly well. Charley Chaplin's amazing performace style still holds up and entertains. A true auteur: writing, directing, starring in, and scoring this classic."

1.0,the_gold_rush,"One of my favorites when I was a little kid, and I still love it! Charlie Chaplin was brilliant and this movie is a good example of him doing what he did best. A comedy with some loneliness thrown in and some of the Tramp's most classic moments. Everyone should see this movie :)"

1.0,the_gold_rush,"You can't be in a bad mood while watching this film, it just isn't possible! From the moment the Tramp enters you can't help but smile. The key sequences are iconic and genius.

1.0,the_gold_rush,"The original silent version and Chaplin's re-release with voiceover are both great, but the silent version is better paced and the sound version is missing some great moments. Not his funniest movie, but definitely one of his best. The movie has a really warm feel, like many of Chaplin's movies."
1.0,the_gold_rush,And a dance he did with the rolls

1.0,the_gold_rush,Dette er Chaplins definitive mesterverk! En fantastisk filmopplevelse fra ende til annen! OBS! Pass på at du ikke se den stemmelagte versjonen han ga ut i ettertid!

1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,Close to perfect. Davis is at her vitriolic best and Baxter is vindictive and scheming. Also the small parts played by Ritter and Monroe were wonderful.

1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,"Wow! Current-day Hollywood is not capable of creating such a gem! The subtlety on multiple levels, as well as Davis' willingness to be shown as a 40-year-old actress, and thus with wrinkles and flaws are hallmarks of the Golden Age. Anne Baxter is also a worthy foe."
1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,this Best Picture winner is perhaps the greatest film about showbiz. Bette Davis gives her best performance here and Celeste Holm and Thelma Ritter are also fascinating here. The witty script strikes the audience at any viewing and it is shot well and directed distinctly

1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,Anne Baxter and Bette Davis deliver 2 legendary performances in this timeless classic!
1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,"Great performances. And remains certain questions for the identity of the human being: who is Eve? Who is Margot? Who are actually the people, by which they are imitated?"
1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,"Bette Davis is maybe the best reason for anyone to watch it, as well as the the excellent work by Manciewicz (co-writter of the script for Welles's ""Citizen Kane"")."
1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,was 1950 the year of satirizing film and theater? superb direction and great performances and the story sucks you in.
1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,"Hollywood at it's knockdown, drag out ""worst"" -- in regard to the story itself. Fine film with some really great individual scenes."

1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,"Bette Davis is so awesomely witty, and completely makes this film her own. Not to take anything away from Anne Baxter, who was wonderful herself, but you just don't go up against Bette Davis and expect to come out unscathed. Definitely a recommended movie!"
1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,This is my all time fav Movie!!!! they should do a remke of this movie but they have to make sure they get it RIGHT!
1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,"A strong candidate that could replace ""American Beauty"" as my favourite film of all time. EVERYONE in the cast was simply perfect, as was the script."

1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,"Burning with cynicism, rage and multiple layers. Massive standout performance from Bette. Revolutionary use of multiple perspectives to construct a tale. A great accompaniment to Sleuth, although much better actedPossibly the best film about acting ever realised"
1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,Loved loved LOVED this movie. A lot. Everything from the story to the acting was fantastic. It's a hard core look at what stardom and the drive to be famous can do to a person.
1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,The bitchiest film ever made. An outstanding script with dynamite performances. It's a brutal attack on Hollywood and the fanaticism with celebrities. Timeless and way ahead of its time. It makes a nice companion piece to both A Star is Born (with Garland) and Scorsese's King of Comedy.
1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,"I really, really love this movie, it is the best black-and-white movie ever!!!!! Performances are amazing, Bette Davis, Anne Baxter, George Sanders, Celeste Holm, and Thelma Ritter give such magnificient performances."

1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,"very weel acted and directed. plus, note how MM just steal the whole screen as she enters the scene."

1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,"Finally, a film with a female heroine and a female villain, and it's not a chick flick! Witty and smart dialogue with such devilish plot twists. I don't know anyone who can resist the charm of Bette Davis. ""Fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy night!"""

1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,"One of the best movies of all time, and definitely THE best screenplay of all time!! I've never seen a movie with better dialog than this!! LOVE IT!! Bette is FLAWLESS!!"
1.0,ran,"There are no words to describe how you feel the moment this film ends. It ranks along with Apocalypse Now, Lawrence of Arabia, The Godfather: Part II and 2001: A Space Odyssey as one of the top 5 greatest films ever made, in my humble opinion."
1.0,ran,RAN is a miraculous film made by one of the best filmmakers of all time. How someone in their 70's could make such an epic take on King Lear is beyond me. It is perhaps Kurosawa's last great film in the Japanese period drama genre- a genre of films he had no equals in.
1.0,ran,One of the best films ever made
1.0,ran,??????4K???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????...??????????????????????????????
1.0,ran,Kurosawa's best work.
1.0,ran,5 Stars. Another masterpiece. Kurosawa just gets it.
1.0,ran,"I'm ashamed that it took me this long to finally see this in its entirety. Obviously masterful direction (such magnificent compositions and camera movement! Such superb sound cues!) aside, what strikes me the most about this is the theme of karma. Karma is a real bitch, and you reap what you sow."
1.0,ran,Kuro Sawa San! See I did go idiot Chris!
1.0,ran,"This one is #4 on my all-time list and just saw a 4k Digital restoration of it in theatres, what an experience. Such a masterful film, but seeing it on the big screen with an enthusiastic audience was truly special. If you've never seen it, then run, don't walk, to check it out!"
1.0,ran,A beautiful feat of terrible and raw tragic power. Ran is simply an amazing movie that transcends description.
1.0,ran,A masterpiece to put it mildly.
1.0,ran,"A (literal) Shakespearean masterpiece, Akira Kurosawa's Ran is a dazzlingly rich, beautifully staged update of a classic fable"
1.0,ran,"Akira Kurosawa's ""Ran"" is my favorite movie of all time. I could go on about why this film is so fantastic in every way, but I'll just leave it at GO WATCH THIS MOVIE RIGHT NOW."
1.0,ran,The greatest fight sequence in the history of cinema.One of my top five favorite movies and just another wonderful notch in a long glorious movie belt for Kurosawa.
1.0,ran,"Another Kurosawa film that speaks no less of his undeniable mastery over both the samurai period film and over cinema in general. The usual perfection is there - the solid acting, excellent cinematography, strokes of meaningful colour, broad set pieces, and all the more heartfelt and pure emotion."
1.0,ran,one of the top ten films ever made.
1.0,ran,"Kurosawa's final masterpiece just might be his best, in a beautifully shot and compelling epic chronically the chaos of one's decent into madness that would make The Bard very proud."
1.0,ran,"In a mad world, only the mad are sane."
0.0,ran,"The most boring Japanese film I've ever seen. It's a period drama about a family fewd which goes on and on and doesn't seem to ever end. It is lauded as a must-see but I really don't know why, I was bored out of my skull."
1.0,ran,One of the many masterpieces of the brilliant Akira Kurosawa.
1.0,ran,"Japanese version of Shakespeare's King Lear. A great film! In a mad world, only the mad are sane. Heaven is far away but hell can be reached in a day."
1.0,ran,Powerful and sublime. Truly a remarkable film. I was mesmerized from the start.
1.0,ran,A flawless retelling of Shakespeare King Lear
1.0,ran,"Mr. Kurosawa is a master of merging the epic scale with the meticulous details, the majestic backdrops with the puny humans within it. With Ran, the result is a must-see for lovers of battle films, period films, or cinema as a whole."
1.0,ran,"An epic film with some of the most greatest battle scenes, characters, and visual shots. It's a superb film adaptation of Shakespeare's King Lear."
1.0,ran,Just another reason Kurosawa continues to reign as my favorite director. So few people can make films this epic and this intimate. Plus it has one of the best uses of color in film history.
1.0,ran,Pince obra de arte otro pedo!!
1.0,ran,"One of the best movies ever made, based on King Lear's Shakespeare and made by the genius Kurosawa = a long masterpiece. YOU GOTTA LOVE IT!"
1.0,ran,"""Ran"" is an epic, gorgeous film. It boasts excellent settings and hues, especially during the battle scenes. I need to see it again."
1.0,ran,29/30. It's so satisfying to finally watch a film about nothing.
1.0,ran,"Impeccable film making from a certified genius in film making.....a little confusing at times, but I could not take my eyes off of it......."
1.0,ran,"King Lear on steroids, a solid look at loyalty, my favorite samurai film, and my favorite film of all time."

1.0,ran,One of Akira Kurosawa's best films .=)
1.0,ran,"The last thing I'd ever expect Kurosawa to do is outdo ""Seven Samurai,"" but he comes damn near close here."
1.0,ran,I love this Movie! it's just stunning to look at!
1.0,ran,this is like the best kurosawa's movie ever! not a single flaw can be found! a superb performance from tatsuya nakadai AS USUAL! who could ever forget the ending and the scenes where the castle burnt to the ground??
1.0,ran,The Japanese King Lear!
1.0,ran,The swirl of human lives is always a beautiful disaster...
1.0,ran,Ran is pure film magic. Akira Kurosawa is a virtuoso unlike any other!
1.0,ran,"This film defines the word epic in every way. characters, story, soundtrack, omg soundtrack! ambition, cinematography (best I've seen), editing I'm pretty sure I can go on but if you're not watching it right now you probably never will, and what a shame that will be."
1.0,ran,Kurosawa deserved an Oscar for Direction. He was nominated in this category. Injustice!
1.0,ran,"What to say, nothing to say just an absolute Masterpiece, beyond epic"
1.0,ran,???? ????? ???. ?? ????? ?????? ??? ???? ???? ???. one of my top 5
1.0,ran,"King Lear, but with samurai. Nuff said."
1.0,ran,I just saw it! It was great!!
1.0,ran,EPIC and just plain beautiful to watch!! I love Akira Kurosawa!!
1.0,ran,I thought it was just another prodigal son story. I was wrong. Epic movie is epic!
1.0,ran,What an epic battle. This film is so good. Kurosawa is the master of Japanese film.
1.0,ran,"Kurosawa's greatest film, and my personal favorite when I was in high school and liked PRETTY COLORS AND BLOOD."
1.0,ran,"It has been said before, but I would like to reiterate: if Shakespeare made films chances are they would look like Ran. Kurosawa proves that he could still direct films well into his eighties and still obilterate the competition."
1.0,ran,What a drag it is getting old.
1.0,ran,First time I saw it I wasn't crazy about it. I just watched it again and loved it. One of the most intense movies I've seen in a long time.
1.0,ran,A spectacular battle epic
1.0,ran,This is why Kurosawa is one of cinema's greats.
1.0,ran,One of the best war movies ever made.
1.0,ran,potentially the most stunningly brilliant movie ever made.
1.0,ran,"Wow, what a movie. I love Japan, it's culture and Japanese. This is a great movie from Japan's best directors Kurosawa. I also love the fact it's an historical movie."
1.0,ran,"""For aficionados of the war movie, the western, and the period action epic, Ran is necessary viewing."" Amy Taublin"
1.0,ran,One of Kurosawa's best
1.0,ran,Akira Kurosawa directed Ran with the same insatiable bloodlust comparable to that of Lord Hidertora's raging sons.
1.0,ran,"Best movie I have seen recently, dark, intense, philosophical, good story and good visual."
1.0,ran,"Kurosawa's interpretation of Shakespeare's King Lear through the prism of Imperial Japan, is one of the great masterpieces of world cinema..."
1.0,ran,"Superb inspiration of King Lear at the hands of a true filmmaking genius. Akira Kurosawa, you deserve a bow. Tragic epic told with as less cheesiness as possible."
1.0,ran,five stars just for the scenery
1.0,ran,Again..Akira Kurosawa...perfect
1.0,ran,"Akira Kurosawa adapts King Lear into a Japanese feudal era piece flawlessly. The Cinematography, and scale of the production design alone solidify the film as a cinematic landmark. Ran will mesmerize it's audience not only as an epic war film, but also as a ironic and engrossing morality play."
1.0,ran,One of the best Shakespeare adaptations ever!!
1.0,ran,"A classic of Japanese cinema. If you haven't watched it, do yourself a favor."
1.0,ran,"Classic epic from every level. Cinematography, music score, costume design, clever performaces, and the battle scenes. The director's re-done ideas of King Lear is as great as you expect. Slow-paced, picking up after the first hour, and then came the heartbreaking ending."
1.0,ran,One of the most epic films I've ever scene. This may currently be my favorite film!
1.0,ran,Terrific film. Possibly Kurosawa's finest film.
1.0,ran,There's nothing I have to say that hasn't been said by the consensus.
1.0,ran,"Kurosawa's interpretation of Shakespeare's King Lear through the prism of Imperial Japan, is one of the great masterpieces of world cinema..."
1.0,ran,This movie is a work of art.
1.0,ran,This movie has some of the best acting in japanese film i've ever seen. Its great i love the beginning when the father gets pissed off at his youngest son
1.0,ran,"Watching an old evil lose its head and find redemption and meaning in the most unlikely of sources, what a watch this is."
1.0,ran,This movie is going to ruin my whole day... but it was excellent
1.0,ran,Kurosawa`s last great movie!
1.0,ran,"By far the best film of Asian cinema! Being new to Akira Kurosawa, i'd love to see more of his films!"
1.0,ran,Love Akira Kurosawa movies..
1.0,ran,"One of the most beautifully filmed films, ever."
1.0,ran,"King Lear in fudeal Japan? What more could anyone need? Not much, I'd say. Kurosawa manages to find a sombre beauty in tragedy and existential crisis. This film is nothing short of astounding."
1.0,ran,"Both grand and intimate. This movie is a colorful, emotional epic that ranks up there with Seven Samurai."
1.0,ran,epic film I loved the colors
1.0,ran,"A nation is a beating heart. And it can be torn asunder.I now realize several dictators have never read Shakespeare or seen Kurosawa's films, explains ALOT.""Those who fail to learn from the past..."""
1.0,ran,Kurosawa's greatest achievement...a pure masterpiece
1.0,ran,amazingly well made epic.
1.0,ran,The best Kurosawa I saw so far! No character is shallow and most of them could have a movie on their own.
1.0,ran,One of the most compelling movies i've ever seen. Excellent in every possible way.
1.0,ran,"It took me 26 years to watch it, to my shame. Kurosawa's epic masterpiece - based on King Lear - is a monument in its own right. A stylishly designed, dark-hearted lesson in the tragical realism that the human condition so often descends into."
1.0,ran,One of Kurosawa's greatest achievements.
1.0,ran,King Lear with Samurais...
1.0,ran,"""Only the birds and the beasts live in solitude."""
1.0,ran,"The massive scale, amount of planning, direction, and coordination that went into this film makes epics like Lord of the Rings look fat and lazy."
1.0,ran,"Kurosawa's ostentatious Shakespearean masterpiece wields vibrant colors, a visceral musical score, extravagant set pieces, and overwhelming epic battles. Despite that, it seemed Kurosawa butchered Shakespeare's play. 98/100"
1.0,ran,Nothing short of an epic and one of Kurosawa's last great work and nothing short of it. I liked just about everything and thats what makes it amazing.
1.0,ran,again I got a VHS copy of this before but now where can I find a copy?
1.0,ran,very long and just beautiful. no words can describe this large scale epic. this is Kurosawa's last great work.
1.0,ran,Het grandiose epos van Akira Kurosawa dat 'King Lear' vertaalt naar het 16de eeuwse Japan. Een meesterwerk en klassieker die je als zelfrespecterende filmfan moet gezien hebben!
1.0,ran,"Sprawling, ambitious, and beautifully shot, Akira Kurosawa's Ran is a marvelous film that showcases Kurosawa's skill for complementing narrative with visuals. The last shot of the film is incredible."
1.0,ran,Kurosawa strikes again with another hari-kari filled samurai flick shot in colour! Superb.
1.0,ran,Kenneth Branaugh eat your heart out. Now THIS is how you adapt Shakespeare
1.0,ran,One of the finest films ever made.
1.0,ran,"For Kurosawa to turn in such a stunning achievement while in his 80s and struggling to find funding and a market in his own country is quite a feat. Kurosawa made plenty of pictures with personality, but none moreso than Ran."
1.0,ran,"A fitting ""end"" to a great director's career that is a classic in of its self."
1.0,ran,"Ran proves that even near the end of his life, Akira Kurosawa will always be one of the greatest directors who ever lived."
1.0,ran,"The thing with Akira Kurosawa's films is to me he's flawless. This is scientific proof of that considering he was over 70 when he made this tale of karma. Lord Hidertora Ichimonji is ruthless, cold, and sadistic. Watch it yourself. Take my word."
1.0,ran,"flexor!!! from rashorom to ran, akira kurosawa never let us disapointed! akira forver!"
1.0,ran,"So fuckin cool. Excellent cinematography, excellent story."
1.0,ran,"in a mad world, only the mad are sane!"
1.0,ran,Kurosawa three of top-ten! Japanese version of King Lear...
0.0,ran,Overrated. Dont know how its in IMDB top 250
1.0,ran,"Epic, beautifully stylish, tragic and disciplined."
1.0,ran,Watching Ran on the big screen is a movie-going experience akin to seeing Lawrence of Arabia in 70 MM. A beautiful and tragic movie.
1.0,ran,"Maybe the best cinematic treatment of Shakespeare (along with Branaugh's HAMLET), with dazzling cinematography and some of the greatest battle sequences ever filmed. Must viewing for anyone not afraid of subtitles."
1.0,ran,This is an exquisite piece of cinema. Shakespeare and Kurosawa make an unbeatable team. See this movie.
1.0,ran,I just saw this at the Belcourt Theater in Nashville and it was AMAZING!
1.0,ran,"another great Kurosawa film, another vision of a great shakesphere play told through his point of view. Like ""Throne of Blood"", Ran is a film that takes Shakesphere vision, translated them into Japanese history, but manges to keep the universal themes."
1.0,ran,Best tragic film ever. More analysis later.
1.0,ran,One of Kurosawa's best
1.0,ran,Kurosawa = Stunning achievement in epic cinema. and in Color!
1.0,ran,"Mieko Harada is creppy and evil as Lady Kaede. The sweep of the ""King Lear"" story is ever sprialling downward. The visuals are striking and gruesome and beautiful. A wonderful film."
1.0,ran,A masterpiece. Epic battles with thousands of extras makes them even more spectacular. Just perfection.
1.0,ran,A Giant Samurai Epic based on Shakespeare's King Lear with great Battles and Natur Shots grandious directed by the Master Akira Kurosawa a tragic Masterpiece about Trust and Mistrust
1.0,ran,Gorgeous masterpiece.
1.0,ran,"This is a masterful and almost perfect visualision and dramatisation of a story thay anyone has ever commited to a film reel, in my opinion. Kurosawa, the master of cinema."
1.0,ran,"Ran is slightly marred by some too obvious straining toward masterpiece status, yet it's a stunning achievement in epic cinema. Working on a large scale seems to bring out the best in Kurosawa's essentially formal talents."
1.0,ran,"One of the, if not the, best film ever!"
1.0,ran,One of the greatest films ever
1.0,ran,"A Tragedy stained with blood, soaked in Cinema"
1.0,ran,saw this years ago as an undergrad. it was incredible! would live to watch it again
1.0,ran,just... amazing. Kurosawa is definitely the greatest of all time.
1.0,ran,Akira Kurosawa's last epic is every bit as brilliant as his early epics.
1.0,ran,"For what can be considered to be Akira Kurosawa's final epic, I honestly can't think of a better way to go out. Visually awe-inspiring. I haven't seen a movie that looks this great in years. As far as I'm concerned, this movie is as close to feudal Japan as modern man can get."
1.0,ran,"A true tragedy, to be sure, but one that always manages to get me in a tremendously deep way. By far my favorite film of Kurosawa's."
1.0,ran,This may well be the best epic film ever made. It's certainly amongst the best I have ever seen.
1.0,ran,"Beautifully filmed and the battle scenes are stunning. Movies like this (Braveheart, Kingdom of Heaven, Troy) are either great or bad in my opinion. Kurosawa never made a bad war film, or a bad film at all really. Check it out if you don't mind subtitles and long takes."
1.0,ran,Perhaps the best Shakespearian adaptation of all time by the cinematic master Akira Kurosawa.
1.0,ran,"I know this has become a cliche saying among movie critics and others. But its so true, nobody could shoot a battle scene like Akira Kurosawa did."
1.0,ran,"Shichinin no Samurai this, Seven Samurai that, and blablabla, yes ppl may say Shichinin no Samurai aka Seven Samurai is Kurosawa's best effort, but this is without doubt my favorite from him ! (and just fyi, i love Seven Samurai, gave it 4 1/2 stars and also in my top 100)"
1.0,ran,A true masterpiece by Kurosawa. The battle sequences were made to look like a ballet on a Sunday night. Truly profound and beautiful.
1.0,ran,"The first movie to have made me cry.I don't cry often.Not when my dog died, not when grandparents pass.This made me cry."
1.0,ran,excellent movie. good job akira
1.0,ran,Kurosawa is infallible. Great take on King Lear. Awesome use of color and scenery.
1.0,ran,Fantastic Epic. The most beautiful opening landscape scenes!
1.0,ran,"One of many Kurosawa movies that is absolutely riddled with amazing costumes and Characters. ""I am lost."" - ""Such is the human condition."""
1.0,ran,"A fantastic adaptation of ""King Lear."" Epic in proportion and brilliantly acted."
1.0,ran,"""Man is born crying. When he has cried enough, he dies."""
1.0,ran,A pure masterpiece. It takes a overdone genre ?samurai films? and pushes the limits. Using Shakespeare as a foundation and building the story into an epic tale of betrayal. This movie has inspired so many filmmakers it should never be ignored.
1.0,ran,Totally breathtaking!
1.0,ran,"Overwhelming and magnificent visual style, resonant and poetic, dynamic, painterly composition and striking, expressionistic color. Mieko Harada is flawlessly ruthless as the vengeful Lady Kaede. The last and greatest masterwork by Akira Kurosawa."
1.0,ran,"Quand Kurosawa se met à la couleur, ça donne un tableau à chaque plan. Un chef-d'oeuvre digne des plus grandes tragédies grecques."
1.0,ran,King Lear in Japan. My favorite Kurosawa and the best King Lear adaptation I have seen. The absence of sound in the battle sequences is haunting.
1.0,ran,A masterpiece by Kurosawa. Easily one of the greatest film adaptations of Shakespeare in history.
1.0,ran,"Very dark existentialist film, one that I identify with very much. Some of the best war scenes ever filmed. Cinematic perfection."
1.0,ran,"The brilliant Japanese director Akira Kurosawa's take on William Shakespeare's KING LEAR is nothing short of stunning. Unforgettable imagery and characters abound in this beautiful work of art. The first viewing may be a bit difficult, but repeat viewings are a joy."
1.0,ran,"I'm pretty sure that this was Kirosawa's first film in technicolor, and it has that stunning colorful beauty of early technicolor films. The acting is great, and the direction is ahead of its time, as with most of Kirosawa's movies."
1.0,ran,"I absolutely love this movie. The first time I rented it from Netflix, I actually watched it twice the same night! Heart-wrenching but wonderful!"
1.0,ran,"I love how colors. Nice, but violent."
1.0,ran,"Undesputably the best battlefield movie merging grand picturesque, Japanese culture, powerful drama and cross reference with Shakespeare's ""King Lear"" by artistic shoting and mastery in directing. Hats off to Akira Kurosawa!"
1.0,ran,The Japanese version of King Lear done many times better. I love that time and moments are savoured in this film. The gorgeous cinematography is really a treat.
1.0,ran,Breathtakingly brilliant.
1.0,ran,Best Movie based on Shakespeare ever totally stunning
1.0,ran,"High tragedy on an epic scale. Gorgeous, lush cinematography. (Those beautiful grassy hills!)"
1.0,ran,Brillant. Tout simplement.
1.0,ran,Extraordinary. Excellent acting. Extremely moving and 3 hours doesn't seem long enough. Mmm.
1.0,ran,Oustanding transfer of King Lear to a samurai epic; interesting choice of long shot photography by Kurosawa.
1.0,ran,"This is by far the best Shakespeare adaptation ever shot on film, and maybe even the best film ever made -- but this is only my humble opinion, of course."
1.0,ran,man crave epic movie. it just can get as epic as this story of shogun who earned everything and lost it all at his final days to a woman full of scorn.
1.0,ran,One of the greatest movies ever made. Possibly Tatsuya Nakadai's greatest role.
1.0,ran,Simply one of the best.
1.0,ran,rarely watch something more beautifull and powerfull on a silver screen
1.0,ran,A true spectacle of cinema. If you can find the time watch it.
1.0,ran,Another bloody film that I surprsingly enjoyed. Hail to Akira Kurosawa.
1.0,ran,Kurasawa's King Lear -- and his masterpiece.
1.0,ran,Kurosawas best movie and probably one of the best movies ever made.
1.0,ran,"""Ran"" must surely be Kurosawa's masterpiece. Mieko Harada is extraordinary,and the settings are simply stunning."
1.0,ran,Excelente filme que la nueva generación no logra apreciar. Ja.
1.0,ran,"Incredible. Costumes, cinematography, direction are all just unbelievable. It makes we wonder what Seven Samurai and other epic Kurosawa would look like in color."
1.0,ran,As near perfect as a film can get.
1.0,ran,"The oldest hath borne most: we that are young,Shall never see so much, nor live so long."
1.0,ran,"I had been meaning to see this for a long time. I thouroughly enjoyed it, it is not as some people think a direct adaptation of King Lear. Yet again another excellent Kurosawa film."
1.0,ran,One of Kurosawa's best in a long career of brilliant films.
1.0,ran,epic. beautiful film by Kirosawa. they don't make films like this anymore.
1.0,ran,one of his best movies!!!
1.0,ran,Superb! Akira Kurosawa didn't fail us. Ran is a breathtaking masterpiece which everyone should watch.
1.0,ran,Kurosawa's last epic is probably the most beautiful of all is films. His direction is impeccable.
1.0,ran,"This movie is a pure EPIC. The scope: EPICThe acting: EPICThe setting: EPICThe story: EPICKurosawa pulled out all the stops for this one, and does not disappoint."
1.0,ran,Kurosawa's portrayal of insanity is one of the bests in cinema.
1.0,ran,What can I say? This man has not made a bad movie (at least with the ones that I have seen). But the story is absolutely amazing and fucked up as well but it is just an amazing piece of cinema. This is a must see. Very well done.
1.0,ran,One of my favourite movies of all times.
1.0,ran,"Based on King Lear, an artistic masterpiece. Kurosawa's best."
1.0,ran,"Wow, wow, and wow. 2 hours and 40 minutes flew by. Great movie all around."
1.0,ran,"Wonderful film. (I should note that it was not released in 2000, but in 1985.)"
1.0,ran,Let's put it this way. Shakespeare was history's greatest playwright. Lear was his greatest play. Kurosawa improved upon it. Nuff said.
1.0,ran,Makes everything else look cheap.
1.0,ran,one hell of a bleak picture. so intense and beautiful (in a very ugly way)one of kurosawa's best.
1.0,ran,YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSH
1.0,ran,"It's fucking Kurosawa, how can it NOT be good?"
1.0,ran,It could only be better if they added ninjas.
1.0,ran,Great adaptation of King Lear.
1.0,ran,Quite simply a masterpiece!
1.0,ran,The performance of actors were very good and the score was excellent. The cinematography was marvelous and the way Kurosawa brought out the colors was just in a genius way. This film is a color masterpiece by Kurosawa.
1.0,ran,Kurosawa is genious.
1.0,ran,"scenery, score, everything was absolutely amazing. it seemed real, until the hyper real blood took hold of the scene. but ti was strong on the connection and emotional portrayal of the characters."
1.0,ran,"Akira Kurosawa's sweeping period piece. The word ""epic"" gets tossed around alot these days, and most of the people who use the word, in regard to film, have no idea what the true meaning of the word is. This film is ""epic"". ""300"" is not!!!"
1.0,ran,"I'm not a huge fan of the story (ie Shakespeare's macbeth), the color, cinematography, emotion, and artistry are truly special.. if it is on story, i prefer his movie seppaku"
1.0,ran,Simply put: a must-see.
1.0,ran,Who would have thought that carnage could be beautiful?
1.0,ran,Another legendary movie.
1.0,ran,I only like Shakespeare when Kurosawa does it
1.0,ran,"This is my favorite Kurosawa film, which is saying a lot considering I love every single movie Kurosawa directed (yes, even Dreams)"
1.0,ran,"highly recommended Shakespearean adaptation by ""Seven Samurai"" famed Akira Kurosawa. an epic story of deathly family relations that shape the lands and sear them with flame."
1.0,ran,Kurosawa is perfection
1.0,ran,"Interesting that it took Japanese film master Kurosawa to make the best screen version of KING LEAR, transforming it into a samurai epic. Grand entertainment."
1.0,ran,Great Film can not add anything that has not been said before or better
1.0,ran,What can anyone say about Kurosawa? Absolutely amazing! Yet another interpretation of Shakespeare that I hasten to say may be better than the original.
1.0,ran,"Perfect. At least as epic as the source material, possibly more so."
1.0,ran,"Truly a masterpiece. Kurosawa reverts to an incredibly simplistic way of shooting a movie, yet that gives the story so much more weight, which is how it should be with Shakespeare. Kurosawa is a master, if all his other films didn't prove that, then Ran certainly sets it in stone."
1.0,ran,The greatest Shakespeare adaptation ever!
1.0,ran,Kurosawa at his very best!
1.0,ran,Il ricordo di una notte insonne passata ad ammirare un grandissimo film!
1.0,ran,So powerful I was literally awed. A masterpiece.
1.0,ran,My favorite Kurosawa movie. And that's saying a lot. Right up there with my favorites of all time. There is no way this movie could have been better. Perfect.
1.0,ran,"A masterful reimaging of ""King Lear"" and possibly my favorite Kurosawa movie of all time. Colorful, beautifully shot, and well-acted."
1.0,ran,King Lear set in Japan
1.0,ran,"Un monumento de peli­cula. Adaptacion japonesa de la obra de Shakespeare ""King Lear"". Cada detalle del filme es arte."
1.0,ran,"Kurosava gives perfectly in Japan the "" king Lear """
1.0,ran,"An epic masterpiece if there ever was one. I cannot find fault with a single aspect of this film. Like Shakespeare's tragedy, Kurosawa's tale is so beautifully dreary in tone, complemented perfectly by the picturesque imagery. If I could, I would frame every shot on a bare, boundless wall."
1.0,ran,amazing film that i think everyone should see
1.0,ran,Best Shakespeare adaptation ever.
1.0,ran,"Shakespeare and Samurai by Kurosawa, in color this time! A great movie, but you have to be prepared for the stylized Japanese approach to acting."
1.0,ran,"Kurosawa does Shakespeare, is there anything he CAN'T do? One of those films I have to call a masterwork."
1.0,ran,"kurosawa's take on king lear. you will feel the pain and sorrow here. you will ask yourself, why do we live amidst such pain and death?"
1.0,ran,"Huge, epic, and utterly brilliant. A true Kurosawa classic, the kind of film you will never see made again."
1.0,ran,"A stunning masterpiece of Japanese cinematography, Kurosawa-san seamlessly blends the romanticism of both feudal Japan and a true Shakespearean classic. This is one of my favorite movies of all time!"
1.0,ran,"Japanese King Lear. Great movie, great shots."
1.0,ran,A classic in my collection
1.0,ran,"Kurasawa's last movie was him at his best. More than King Lear, its predominantly pessimistic and dark tone contrasts starkly from some of Kurosawa's more impetuous movies. It is an epic delivered with strong theatrical and thematic elements."
1.0,ran,"My favorite film directed by Kurosawa (along with ""Ikiru""), this is the Japanese samurai version of King Lear. It should come to no surprise then that this is one depressing movie."
1.0,ran,"If Lawrence of Arabia is one man's epic, Ran is mankind's. Transcends culture. Kear Lear from The Master of narrative film."
1.0,ran,"Not a movie I can just watch any old day (long, and slow paced at times), but still perhaps my favourite from Kurosawa (or anybody else)."
1.0,ran,This movie made both Shakespeare and Japanese Cinema click for me. I owe much of the rest of my movie watching life to its greatness. -Ryan
1.0,ran,"Ran is Kurosawa at his best; brilliantly filmed on a grand scale. Kurosawa has an amazing ability to chronicle the faults of mankind in ways that are incredibly simple, yet powerful."
1.0,ran,"Great version of Samurai/Lear/Shakespeare, totally tragic and stunning realisation that God cries for man's injustice to man. Kurasawa outdid even himself here going beyond the culture to man's core essence. Beautiful to look at as a movie should be."
1.0,ran,this is like the best kurosawa's movie ever! not a single flaw can be found! a superb performance from tatsuya nakadai AS USUAL! who could ever forget the ending and the scenes where the castle burnt to the ground??
0.0,ran,"A legendary work of epic cinematic genius? Maybe, but I think it's fuck boring and have decided never to endure a Kurosawa movie ever again..."
1.0,ran,Perfect... anything else I say would just diminish this master piece.
1.0,ran,"Possibly one the best EVER. Kurosawa's direction, spotless. Shakespeare's storyline and charactes, awesome. Dialogues gracefully toned down. Acting, superb."
1.0,ran,Two towering masters meet: Shakespeare and Kurosawa
1.0,ran,It is the Grand Masterpiece of Akira Kurosawa.
1.0,ran,King Lear in Japanese. Beautiful beautiful cinematography (omg the battles) with great characters. Possibly the best epic tragedy I've seen.
1.0,ran,this movie is beautiful
1.0,ran,"Stunning! The battle sequences are drama and tragedy mixed with spectacle and lyricism. The whole film is beautifully made, with the tragedy of King Lear (on which it is based) and then some!"
1.0,ran,"This was an amazing film. The cinematography, the costumes, the script... I can see why it was nominated and won so many awards. The ending was very depressing and oh so Shakespearian. I recommend it to all.Btw, the trailer doesn't do this film justice."
1.0,ran,Akira Kurosawa is genious! Brilliant movie.
1.0,ran,fantastic! i especially love the colors and the banners and the crazy makeup on the father
1.0,ran,"If you sit down to see RAN, be prepared for a jaw-dropping experience. Akira Kurosawa-Shakespeare of the Japanese Film industry."
1.0,ran,"Kurosawa's ""painting on film"". possibly the most beautiful film (in colour and scope) ever made."
1.0,ran,"Overwhelming in its portrait of human blindness, consequence, and regret, ""Ran"" is a visual meditation that never stops giving, with moments of painterly beauty juxtaposed with terrible moments of violence. The haunting music cues in the large-scale battles will knock you on the floor."
1.0,ran,"One of the last movies made by the legendary Akira Kurosawa. Being almost completely blind when making ""Ran"", the crew had to rely on paintings Kurosawa had made to make this adaptation of Shakespeare's ""King Lear""."
1.0,ran,"The crowning achievement of a legendary career, it's a masterpiece on every level. One of the few adaptations of Shakespeare's works that lives up to the original as a work of art."
1.0,ran,Kurosawa was a painter too... it shows
1.0,ran,"Excelente adaptación del Rey Lear en manos de Kurosawa. La mejor dirección de arte que he visto, está en esta película."
1.0,ran,"With ""Ran"", Kurosawa takes the greatest play ever written to a whole new level and the end result is unbelievable."
1.0,ran,"Excllent very cool. A character driven epic full of loyalty, betrail, friendship and action. The battle scenes especially highlight the epic nature of the film as well as being historical acurate."
1.0,ran,"This film gets a wrap for holding a very depressing world view. Everything made sense though, power over family, suffering over religious sanctuary, etc. Seemed realistic in that vein..."
1.0,ran,"Another great from Kurosawa and one of the best retellings of ""King Lear""."
1.0,ran,"kurosawa's quickly becoming one of my favorite directors. it's absolutely thrilling to see him retell shakespeare's ""king lear"" in a way that stays faithful to the original while still leaving his unmistakable stamp on it."
1.0,ran,Kurosawa's last masterpiece.
1.0,ran,Kurosawa's last masterpiece.
1.0,ran,If you do not see this movie then you have no soul.
1.0,ran,"Drama épico dirigido por el inigualable Akira Kurosawa. Narra la historia del clan Hidetori, basado en una obra de William Shakespeare."
1.0,ran,Epic and one of the best adaptations of King Lear ever.
1.0,ran,"Another stellar performance from Kurasawa, at times the movie was hard to folow, but it was still very well done. Also was shot beautifully which you come to expect from his movies."
1.0,ran,Kurosawa doing what he does best!!!
1.0,ran,"epic, almost grandiose, but intimate and visually lyrical"
1.0,ran,Another favorite. The single most beautifully shot film ever made.
1.0,ran,"even though i've never actually read ""king lear"" i thought that the story was executed amazingly well. it's gripping and the japanese setting made it all the more spectacular. my favorite characters were hidetora dono and kaede sama. ^w^"
1.0,ran,"Facebook provides too small a space to do justice to a movie like this, so I'll just say that it has one of the most beautiful final images I've ever seen in a movie, right up there with Nostalghia."
1.0,ran,"Kurosawa has a tendency to drag it out, but this adaptation of the Shakespearian tragedy deserves it. A great film to watch despite its length and subtitles (unless, of course, you speak nihongo)."
1.0,ran,All-time-favoritt. Best-asian-movie....EVER!
1.0,ran,This may well be the best epic film ever made. It's certainly the best I have ever seen.
1.0,ran,I was becoming more and more emotionally attached to this movie as I was watching it.. definitely one of his best! I wonder how it would have been with Mifune.
1.0,ran,"Un tres tres grand film, pour un des plus grands realisateurs que la terre n'ai jamais portee!"
1.0,ran,"Excelente, la fotografÃ¬a y ambientaciÃ²n da el toque perfecto a una tragica hisoria donde los conflictos son transversales a sus personajes. Impacta la crudeza de las escenas de batalla y la lealtad de los samurais a su seÃ±or"
1.0,ran,there are really pretty colors and samurai charging each other.
1.0,ran,this film justifies the use of color for film. The stark use of it makes for visual masterpieces that should be required viewing for all art majors
1.0,ran,"Akira Kurosawa does big budget busy yet atmospheric King Lear meets samurai epic in glorious technicolour, featuring a mad dad, two no-good sons, one very angry woman, plus all out war. Absolute carnage. I loved this."
1.0,ran,Kurosawa is The Man.
1.0,ran,"An epic, moving and beautiful film. Kurosawa paints on a huge canvas but looses none of his trademark humanity, something that many a director mining for an Oscar can learn from these days..."
1.0,ran,"If there is such thing as a perfect film for me, I think this is as close as they get. There's nothing in this film I don't like. Visually mesmerizing, thematically powerful, emotionally haunting. I hate that something this good exists, because it forces me to face my own limitations."
1.0,ran,"To put it simply: King Lear where everyone actually has real motivations, rather than just being evil because the play needs a villain."
1.0,ran,As epic as epics get. Massive battle scenes would lead one to believe that making LOTR without any CGI would be possible.
1.0,ran,AMAZING!!! Kurosawa is a genius! One of the best war films I've ever seen.
1.0,ran,King Lear. Medieval Japan. Kurosawa. You haven't seen yet - Shame on you!!!!
1.0,ran,"This is a tragedy, one of the most bleak movies of all time. As well as one of the most perfect."
1.0,ran,"quite possibly the apex of kurosawa's brilliant career. his version of king lear, perfectly transposed to feudal japan is restrained, beautiful and tragic."
1.0,ran,Arguably the most beautifully shot and designed movie I've ever seen.
1.0,ran,Kurosawa's bloody take on Shakespeare's King Lear is a feast for both the senses and the mind.
1.0,ran,so nihilistic that you probably won't be able to sleep peacefully ever again. the tragedy of man's eternal search for bloodshed. yay.
1.0,ran,The only way I can describe this movie is as a masterpiece
1.0,ran,"Visually beautiful, especially towards the end, there's this a battle scene in slow motion w/ excellent music in the background. Almost surreal. Brutal."
1.0,ran,The battle at the third castle is one of the most beautiful pieces of film I've ever experienced.
1.0,ran,Kurosawa + Shakespeare = Masterpiece
1.0,ran,"Ran, simply put, is a cinematic masterpiece. The cinematography is absolutely perfect and precise, the shots and settings are beautiful and stunning, and the character development is complex and masterfully executed. Another excellent film by Akira Kurosawa."
1.0,ran,A fantastic & truly great film - Kurosawa's final great epic
1.0,ran,A Japanese re-rendition of Shakespeare and one that quite surpasses the original.
1.0,ran,Visually the most entertaining of Kurosawa's body of work.
1.0,ran,"Called the master's best film and for good reason. This is Kurosawa's adaption of King Lear, and he owns the material completely, making you think that Shakespeare stole his ideas from Japan."
0.0,ran,"Perhaps I'm not cultured enough, but I found this movie long and boring. It was pretty hilarious when the king was all confused and had flowers in his hair. But let's face it, I had not idea what was going on."
1.0,ran,Immense. The transposition of King Lear into Japanese cinema is inspired. The enormity and artistry of cinema has never done Shakespeare so much justice. And vice versa.
1.0,ran,A great Japanese King Lear! Powerful!
1.0,ran,"A riot of colour, violence and intrigue in this adaptation of King Lear from the master of period Japanese film."
1.0,ran,"Another stupendously good film from Kurosawa, this one an adaptation of King Lear. Ran is a stunningly powerful war drama and is unforgettable."
1.0,ran,"This is one of my top-five. Why? Certainly for the imagery (that's what the movies are about, if you ask me), more than the story (King Lear). The battle scene(s) are simply the best movie scenes ever done. Period."
1.0,ran,"This movie is the definition of Epic.  Plus, all the extras actually died. Japan is so xhardxcorex."
1.0,ran,"The greatest film ever made, by the greatest filmmaker of all time! It's long, though, and not for the casual film-goer. You won't get much out of it unless you are willing to ""read into it."" Don't watch it JUST for entertainment value, like so many losers out there do!"
1.0,ran,A classic by Kurasawa
1.0,ran,"All I have to say is that this should have won Best Picture in 1986. Instead the Oscar went to ""Out Of Africa"". Oh, the pain!"
1.0,ran,great movie enjoy kurosawa
1.0,ran,"Absolutely goddamn masterful. Released in the '80s (not 2000 like this site mysteriously says), this is Kurosawa's last true masterpiece. Probably my favorite film adaptation (however loose) of ""King Lear,"" and some of the best battle scenes in film history."
1.0,ran,Akira Kurosawa's best shot in my opinion! Great movie.
1.0,ran,This film is breathtaking. It is clearly Kurosawa at his best. Normally I despise interpretations of Shakespeare but this makes King Lear as poignant as ever.
1.0,ran,A Glorious masterpiece that all true movie lovers should see.
1.0,ran,Commanding. Epic. Majestic.
1.0,ran,My favorite all-time movie. Epic and bizarre yet poetic.
1.0,ran,This is one of Kurosawa's masterpieces. The film is a retelling in of King Lear on an epic scale. The battle scenes are terrific.
1.0,ran,Kurosawas's retelling of King Lear would made Shakespeare proud! Has the best battle sequence of all time as well!
1.0,ran,"it's a long movie, but it's worth it with the beautiful story."
0.0,ran,Snooooore Fest but I get that it's a classic...
1.0,ran,I remember this one from when I was little...still one of my faves!
1.0,ran,"Epic translation of King Lear twinned with the Japanese legend of three arrows. Performances range from excellent to sublime. Minamalist music sets of the immense beauty of the background. Builds up to a stunning culmination of loss, betrayal and murder. A perfect film."
1.0,ran,"Post-apocalyptic, despite the fact that it's set in the 1600's. A guttural lamentation to the miseries of the world."
1.0,ran,"loved many things about this movie and i am not blood thirsty, but that was some of the best blood spurting i have seen and the dying man holding his own severed arm. wow."
1.0,ran,"Yet again, superb work from Kurosawa."
1.0,ran,fantastic and beautiful movie
1.0,ran,Kurosawa is not a broom... ; )Inspired by Shakespear..
1.0,ran,amazing visions and depth.
1.0,ran,"I hate to say this, but this may be the greatest Shakespeare adaptation of all time."
1.0,ran,Blood is not thicker than water!
1.0,ran,one of my favorite films of all time; back before CG armies
1.0,ran,"Paranee, oka katselu kerta. Ja Maijakin alkoi heto odotella seuraavaa. Kertoo maailman lumipallo efektista, jonka ehka ihmiset voivat saada alkuun, mutta jota ei hallitse kukaan. Siita nimi ""sekasorto/kaaos"". Lisaksi nayttaa mita kay jos joku todella ymmartaa miten valo taittuu ja tekee elokuvan."
1.0,ran,"it is an excellent adaptation of king lear, the videotape we watched though must have been so sucky though because it looked like it was from the '70s"
1.0,ran,My heavens. Kurosawa's best? Probably. As good a film as Lear is a play.Yeah. It's that good.
1.0,ran,"the idea of remaking a Shakespeer masterpeice in another culture is great, Kurosawa pulled it off flawlessly...A perfect tragedy"
1.0,ran,- I am lost...- Such is the human condition.
1.0,ran,"A masterful film with amazing set pieces. It is worth trying to get a hold of the special edition of this film, as the DVD has a making of doc on it with behind the scenes footage of AK."
1.0,ran,Lear in Japanese sounds like a strange idea but this is vintage Kurosawa. The concepts of honour/dishonour and family are also very Asian as Kurosawa depicts. The visuals are a feast - see it on a big screen.
1.0,ran,The David Lean of Japanese cinema. I am truly ashamed to say i have only seen two Kurowaswa films. I dont know why?
1.0,ran,"One of the biggest, if not the biggest influence on film-making even to this day. Kurosawa truly captures you in this film, through beautiful visuals, unbelievable shots of Japanese landscapes, and more."
1.0,ran,"beautiful visuals, tried and true story expertly told, well acted, enormous armies on horseback executing maneuvering on the field? count me in!"
1.0,ran,"The most tragic, beautiful, and intense movie since Das Boot, and I think a considerable expansion and improvement on Shakespeare's tragedy of King Lear."
1.0,ran,Akiro Kirosawa is the man - George Lucus stole alot of ideas from him - shame on you George...but chur for the Empire Strikes back aye
1.0,ran,Yet another masterpiece by Kurosawa. I want to have his babies.

1.0,anatomy-of-a-murder,"The intrigue of this movie comes from the fact that your mind will not agree with your emotions. As I was trying to determine the verdict for myself, my emotions were pulling me one way while my mind was pulling me the other. It was a great cinematic tug of war."

1.0,anatomy-of-a-murder,One of the best courtroom dramas ever.
1.0,anatomy-of-a-murder,"Another wonderful vehicle for perhaps the most loved actor ever to grace the silver screen.

1.0,vertigo,"My personal favorite film. Vertigo's tantalizing darkness offers unique insight into the mind of its director and, to a much lesser extent, the hearts of love lorn men. Every facet of this film was rendered, and even restored, by masters of the craft."
1.0,vertigo,My personal favourite.
1.0,vertigo,"Alfred Hitchcock's most stunning achievement that define his catalogue of suspense theme. Vertigo mourns the loss of love in discomfort. It's the kind of film that repays careful attention, as almost every moment is filled with significant detail."
1.0,vertigo,Innovative camera work and dense character analysis combine to form one of Hitchcock's most Hitchcockian films.
0.0,vertigo,"Just about some creepy guy who can't take a hint and some chick who is so in need of the company of others she spends time with him. It's creepy, weird, in no way suspenseful with one of the worst endings I have ever seen!"
1.0,vertigo,"A hypnotic, beautiful, tragic love story. One of the purest examples of cinema as a window to our dreams."
1.0,vertigo,My favorite Hitchcock probably

1.0,vertigo,My favorite film and always will be.
1.0,vertigo,"9.5/10. 7-31-2014.Original rating: 4/5 (1-5-2011). ""The first half is leisurely paced, but it has a magnetic power that gradually pulls you in. Not my favorite Hitchcock film, but no doubt one of his best."""
1.0,vertigo,"Almost perfection in framing direction and sound effects, this psychological thriller is a work of art, one of a kind that only Hitchcock could have done"
1.0,vertigo,"This is the best film of Hitchcock, and the best movie I've ever seen."
1.0,vertigo,A cop who's recently retired from the force because he suffers from vertigo takes a job trailing an old college friend's wife and grows obsessed with the mysterious woman. A masterpiece of dizzying psychological depths.
1.0,vertigo,"An amazing journey into love, betrayal , and paying the ultimate price for actions which scarred and hurt a trusting decent human being."
1.0,vertigo,"A classic mystery with a few quirks, Vertigo hooks you on a case with supernatural circumstances until the end. The so called magnum opus of the master of suspense doesn't let up."

1.0,vertigo,The Summit of Hitchcock.
1.0,vertigo,The complicated story and perfect James Stewart performance will satisfy any suspense lover.
1.0,vertigo,"Sweet, villainous, insistent, gently terrifying, and breathlessly melancholy, a wretched, sick-to-the-soul textbook for psychologically-primed filmmaking that comes uncomfortably close to something like a perfect film."
1.0,vertigo,"Surreal feeling and elusive, one of my favourite elements of Vertigo is it's hypnotic approach to direction, which takes a decent (yet ordinary) mystery and makes it seem strangely dreamlike. Combined with an outstanding script, cast and score this is easily one of the greatest thrillers ever."
1.0,vertigo,"Erotically charged and beautifully surreal, Hitchcock's Vertigo is perhaps his best film if only because the melodrama doesn't fall short of the mystery, the two are marvelously combined to create a thrilling and suspenseful mystery and a haunting meditation on love and evocation of the unearthly."

1.0,vertigo,"Hitchcock's best, most disturbing, and most moving film plays far better on repeat viewings, allowing one to ignore the private eye and thriller trappings and focus on the romantic, obsessive, emotional core."
1.0,vertigo,This movie is like an onion. It has layers.
1.0,vertigo,Molding an image to the tune of our dreams...Obsession has never been portrayed so good...
1.0,vertigo,"The weirdest, trippiest, most thought-provoking love story ever put on film...and now our HD TVs."

1.0,vertigo,"As time goes by the better ""Vertigo"" looks!"

1.0,vertigo,Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece.

1.0,vertigo,"Vertigo is, in a word, unbelievable. Never has a story of obsession sat with me quite like this one. It's a slow, tense burn of a thriller, as well as a genuinely honest and personal drama. I love every frame of this film."

1.0,vertigo,"On hieno mestarin duuni, mutta maailman paras elokuva? Ei nyt sentään."

1.0,vertigo,"This is the one. My favorite movie of all time. Was not quite a warm welcome to cinema back in 1958, but in time it would become Hitchcock's masterpiece. Everything from Hitch's direction to a great cast, Bernard Herrmann's score, and San Francisco's setting, Vertigo is that good."
1.0,vertigo,"hands down, vertigo is my all-time favorite film."
1.0,vertigo,"Is it the best movie ever made? Debatable. It's certainly the most artful.

1.0,vertigo,"Vertigo is bound to have you shuddering in their seat from the minute it drags you in, with a brilliant story and cinematography with typically clever motifs from Hitchcock. Even though the set reminds us of so many other Hitchcock films, it plays out like no other piece in existence."
1.0,vertigo,Did not see that coming at all. Fantastic work from the master himself. I cannot wait to explore more of his works.
1.0,vertigo,"A haunting masterpiece. A slow-burner, and not quite the usual Hitchcock suspense story; Vertigo deals with one man's obsession and personal frailty in the face of mysterious outside forces."

1.0,vertigo,A Hitchcock masterpiece.
1.0,vertigo,"Another Hitchcock classic. Stewart gives off one of his best roles as a man who, aptly, suffers from vertigo. However, it is also the audience who suffers from dizziness and confusion due to the legendary director's clever plot and visual mastery. A superb picture. Highly recommended!"

1.0,vertigo,"If the Mona Lisa is proof that colors are capable of creating blinding beauty, Vertigo is proof that the eye of a lens is just as able, the prose of human speech just as delicious as an authentic Chinese Cuisine and a man behind a machine is as dangerous as a man with a pen or brush."

1.0,vertigo,"Superb film by the master. Stewart in possibly his best Hitchcock role, a great twist a superb premise and some greatlocational shots and setups - classic suspense thriller"
1.0,vertigo,"Hitchcocks most personal, psychologically complex, haunting, provocative and poetic picture ever made. An absolute classic if there ever was one. His third greatest picture is a spectacular one."
1.0,vertigo,Again an excellent old movie. Suspense is off the charts!
1.0,vertigo,"Jimmy Stewart does something well here that he so rarely did: play an unlikable, scummy guy. And it works. Great mystery story that has a constant sense of building dread, which we know can only end in tragedy."
1.0,vertigo,"The best suspense film ever made. Bar none. When the music ends you want nothing but to watch it again. Just perfect. The score, cinematography and performances combine to make this one of the finest pieces of cinema created."
1.0,vertigo,A brilliant motion picture that captures the essence of cinema and why I love to go to the movies
1.0,vertigo,Hitchcock's unmistakeable masterpiece.
1.0,vertigo,"Fantastic cinema, perhaps Hitchcocks greatest film. I found it very haunting, and it's interesting here how Hitchcock uses Kim Novak, as one feels sympathetic for her, as she is trapped. Very sad, I think. The ending reminds me a little of Chinatown."
1.0,vertigo,Just a perfect film.
1.0,vertigo,I just joined Flixter and this is the first movie I searched. Guess which is my favorite movie?
1.0,vertigo,"Alfred Hitchcock. The greatest filmmaker to ever walk the earth. Bravo!  PS In this film, Jimmy Stewart does not indicate when he turns. THE SWINE!"
1.0,vertigo,"Nunca pense ke una peli ""romantica"" fuera asi de buena!!!"
1.0,vertigo,"James Stewart's obsessive performance, the combination of suspense and tragedy, and the used of the legendary Vertigo shot (aka Dolly zoom) that only the Master of Supense can pull-off in his finest work."
1.0,vertigo,GORGEOUS IN GORGEOCITY BLISSS!!!!1 OH BLISS
1.0,vertigo,Hitchcock's finest film and one of the most twisted and haunting love stories ever told. There hasn't been anything like it.
1.0,vertigo,"If, by the end of this movie, you look on the ground and there isn't a puddle of piss and drool, there's something wrong with you. ""Vertigo"" is a clear documentation of lustful obsession influencing the structure of filmmaking. It's everything great about Hitchcock packed into a ball of awesome."
1.0,vertigo,"The most influential Hitchcock film, at his artistic peak."
1.0,vertigo,"Keeps you guessing at every turn. This tale of insanity and obsession is so good, it's painful to watch."
1.0,vertigo,Smart! Smashing! Sensational!
1.0,vertigo,A great Hitchcockian classic. Funny how it has little to do with the condition Vertigo...
1.0,vertigo,One of the best ever

1.0,american_in_paris,Dance scene at the end is amazing
1.0,american_in_paris,"Beautiful film, loved it!"
1.0,american_in_paris,"""Un Americano en París"" es un musical inmortal con una visión mágica y onírica de París y con un Gene Kelly que demuestra que bailar no va en sentido contrario con la masculinidad. Esto es cine de primer orden."
1.0,american_in_paris,A wonderful musical by Vincente Minnelli.

1.0,american_in_paris,A wonderful musical festival full of romance and class that captures the scent of Arthur Freed.
1.0,american_in_paris,One of the best musicals ever made. Better then singing in the Rain. The Sound of Music and My Fair Lady are a close second
1.0,american_in_paris,One of Gene Kellys marsterpieces. I loved the 10 minute ballet sequence what a complex number but perfectly pulled off by Gene! :)
1.0,american_in_paris,Only I do not give six stars because there is not. This film is an authentic gem

1.0,american_in_paris,It's beautiful...it's marvolous... that you should care for me!!!!
1.0,american_in_paris,Like a guitar or drum solo in a 70s psychedelic rock gig mixed with a Bogart film.

1.0,american_in_paris,The best musical ever.Gene Kelly is amazing and the cinematography is great.
1.0,american_in_paris,"Gorgeous and wonderful. The final ballet climax is so great, it almost makes you forget the film reaches a resolution devoid of any real dramatic closure (there is never any confrontation between Gerry and Lise's other suitor.) Still, who really cares. This film is filled with beauty and joy"
1.0,american_in_paris,The ballet at the end merits five stars all by itself - it's gorgeous.
1.0,american_in_paris,this was really good....Oscar Lavant's character was hilarious....the last ballet was wow

0.0,american_in_paris,"Go watch paint dry, it will be more fun then this SHIT."
1.0,american_in_paris,"Gene Kelly is an expat painter, Leslie Caron debuts as his muse, music by Gershwin, piano by Oscar Levant. If you don't like this musical, you are probably a Nazi. Yeah, you heard me!"

1.0,american_in_paris,"It's paris, it's gershwin, it's kelly, it's caron, it's self-reflexivity, it's ballet, it's men dancing together half naked, it's romantic irony, it's in short a dream, and no director knew more about dreams and their power than vincente minnelli. perfection."
1.0,american_in_paris,Love the dancing. Love those old movies with Gene Kelly.
1.0,american_in_paris,This is an exceptionally wonderful old movie that I watched with my parents when I was growing up.

1.0,american_in_paris,"What is there not to like: Minnelli, Kelly, Caron, and Gershwin! It has a very 1950's era sensibility about male and female roles but I view that sociologically/historically."
1.0,american_in_paris,"Somehow the fact that is movie was made in the middle of the 20th century is important, I just haven't had time to figure out why! lol..... In musical cinema this is one of the most artistically modern in its dancing."

1.0,american_in_paris,"To me far superior than Singi'n In The Rain, much more artistic and ambitious. Plus the Gershwin doesnt hurt either. Kelly is at his peak, artistically and most of in the choreagraphy. The highpoint of the MGM machine."
0.0,american_in_paris,This probably worked in 1951 by now - Dead boooring... the dance scene in the end lasts fooooreeveeer and is most likely choreographed by a Gene on Absinthe.
1.0,american_in_paris,Gershwin meet Kelly could not go wrong. Awesome movie!
1.0,american_in_paris,He's simply fantastic in the Toulouse Lautrec dancing and when dancing and singing with the children at the beginning. Lovely one.

1.0,american_in_paris,Of all the great MGM musicals this is the one I return to over and over again. Fantastically imaginative choreography and a beautiful Gershwin score.
1.0,american_in_paris,My favorite Gene Kelly movie. I love how Kelly's modern dance juxtaposes with Leslie Caron's classical ballet.
1.0,american_in_paris,"It has its lengths, the plot gets occasionally creaky but the music, the choreography, the ambition make this an outstanding musical. When Hollywood's fake versions of places were so great it didn't matter they weren't the real thing."
1.0,american_in_paris,Oh..this was a great movie..I enjoyed every piece of it specially the dance and the paris scenery

1.0,american_in_paris,"If this film proves nothing else, it proves that telling Gene Kelly he can't actually film in Paris just pisses the man off and he makes the best frickin musical ever filmed to spite you.  Seriously, Gershwin, Kelly and Caron. You'd have to work HARD to make some thing bad out of that."

1.0,1001115-apartment,"I finally saw this, and was impressed with how it kills every other romantic comedy that has ever been made. I mean, rom-coms are generally pretty crappy-that's a given. Not so with this one. Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine are great."
1.0,1001115-apartment,"Hurrah for Fran, Baxter, Sheldrake, Dreyfuss and Dobisch. Billy Wilder had a knack for smart and subtle studio era comedy like no other. In an era bound by formula, the Oscars deservedly swept this classic up and lauded it for everything it deserved. A must see for everyone."

1.0,1001115-apartment,"They really don't make movies like this anymore. Jack Lemmon is brilliant, Shirley MacLaine is sublime, and Fred MacMurray is truly frightening as the villain, especially for those who know him best as the good father on ""My Three Sons."" A Billy Wilder classic."

1.0,1001115-apartment,"A romantic comedy masterpiece, featuring a cast from heaven. Wilder doesn't shy away from the darkness, layering whimsical, romantic material with adult themes, but never losing the deft comic appeal of the central love story. One of the greatest endings ever, too."
1.0,1001115-apartment,Both funny and sad at the same time. One of my favorite romantic movies. It amazes me how far ahead of its time this movie was when it came out.
1.0,1001115-apartment,"One of my favorite films. The kind of film you just want ""live in,"" odd for a film that's so claustrophobic too. This will make you want to see everything Jack Lemmon's ever done. Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond's screenplay doesn't have many equals."
1.0,1001115-apartment,One of my absolue favorite B&W; flicks.

1.0,dont_look_now,Not for the easily-bored or the not-interested-in-cool-cinematography. But if that's your bag- watch it. Again and again and again.
1.0,dont_look_now,Everyone involved in this film is brilliant beyond measure.
1.0,dont_look_now,The direction and mood Roeg creates as he tells his story sets it apart as a classic.
1.0,dont_look_now,I love every frame of this movie . Julie Christie is brilliant as is Donald Sutherland . It's got to be possibley my all time favourite film
1.0,dont_look_now,This is a very unsettling film. Roeg did an awesome job of adapting that very scary Daphne Du Maurier atmosphere to the screen. Let's face it...who didn't nearly piss themselves when 'the child' is revealed?
1.0,dont_look_now,Holy shit. Holy SHIT.
1.0,dont_look_now,Great piece of filmmaking by genius filmmaker Nicolas Roeg. Great performances by Sutherland and Christie. This is the film that has influence filmmakers like Steven Soderburgh and Chris Nolan.
1.0,dont_look_now,"Elaborate tapestry of themes, subtext and stories make a slow burning masterclass in film-making. Marriage, loss, coincidence, religion, belief, fate; Don't Look Now is a basket full of delicious things to think about."
1.0,dont_look_now,"This film draws you in like very few others. Completely intriguing and beautifully shot - the plot will leave you guessing for long after. After 10 years since 1st watching, and speaking to the director, I still don't know what it means"
1.0,dont_look_now,"One of the most beautiful films ever made. Haunting, lyrical, erotic, unique."
1.0,dont_look_now,Roeg's best. A startling study of loss and decay. With some of the best editing captured on film.
1.0,dont_look_now,"Not many film's give me nightmares,this film did.Its a beautifully shoot film and very haunting.Christie & Sutherland are both amazing & Venice has never looked more beautiful...But it's that ending that get's me every time...a bloody classic."

1.0,dont_look_now,Brilliant you wanker - see itfive stars
1.0,dont_look_now,Feckin terrifying and with no gore...accessories required for watching; a large cushion and someone to cling to who preferably isn't just laughing at you. Still get freaked if I see a child in a red hooded coat...
1.0,dont_look_now,"Art-house and horror mix spectacularly in this 70s gem about second sight and fate. They don't write or film them like this anymore... Don't bother if you need effects, action or gore to appreciate film."
1.0,dont_look_now,my favourite movie - ever
1.0,dont_look_now,"If you like your horror fast, visceral and in your face this is not for you. Don't Look Now is a psychological horror, it doesn't have all the tricks and bells other horrors employ. Rather it chips away at your nerves slowly until the final scenes when all is revealed. Rewarding."
1.0,dont_look_now,"You wouldn't expect it, but it is a horror film in all the best ways...not with blood and gore, but a very scary little gnome my friends and I still joke about! A great 70's film!"
1.0,dont_look_now,"What is suspense? Learn it here. Nic Roeg in magnificent form. Better than the other serious old continent horror. In fact, not horror in the usual sense at all. Sutherland is tops."
1.0,dont_look_now,This one will stick with you.
1.0,dont_look_now,"Venice and the red raincoat...If you travel to Venice, it's quite easy to check some of the places. The church DS is restoring is San Nicolo dei Mendicoli in northwest Venice."
1.0,dont_look_now,A very deep film. This is not really a scary film in the sense that it will make you jump. Seriously how many of us have jumped at The Shining or The Exorcist? But seriously this is a fantastic horror film that will leave you with a very uncomforatble feeling.
1.0,dont_look_now,david lynch must have seen this many times. so should you.
1.0,dont_look_now,A psychological thriller like no other. Nobody shoots and structures a movie quite like Nicholas Roeg and he's never found better subject matter.
1.0,dont_look_now,"Very atmospheric and unusual film, really creepy in parts, and with the most erotic love scene ever."

1.0,dont_look_now,One of the scariest films I have ever seen.
1.0,dont_look_now,Few director's can match Roeg's ability to make the everyday seem so terrifying. Venice has never creepier and the colour red so chilling.

1.0,dont_look_now,"Wonderfully filmed and acted, very haunting and atmospheric."
1.0,dont_look_now,"The fractured strucure of the narrative with flashbacks, flash forwards was deeply innovative when made. It is a wonderfully haunting film"
1.0,dont_look_now,The ending contains one of the scariest things ever placed in a movie.
1.0,dont_look_now,"The end of this film shocked me tremedously the first time I saw it.

1.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,"great cast. even greater direction. Angela Lansbury steals the movie. Best line of dialogue : ""12 days of Christmas? 1 day is entirely loathsome enough"" There's a reason this has stayed a classic"

1.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,The film's concept sounds like outrageous Cold War propaganda but in execution it's a thoroughly surreal and cynical thriller that has very little to do with political or patriotic ideology. Further proof of Frankenheimer's underated brilliance.
1.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,Arguably the most suspenseful film Sinatra made. Great cast and direction make this an instant classic. On Blu-ray and in The Criterion Collection.

1.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,even the remake was ok
1.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,"the best thinkingmans thriller there is with sinatra as a good hero, harvey a desperate victem, leigh as a weird charachter but with intreigue, and landsbury stands above all as a molevolent and ruthless mastermind that definetly srays from mrs.potts"

1.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,"There is no contest, this version is far better than the version staring Denzel Washington. Angela Lansbury makes for a supreme and scary villain."

1.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,"Suspenseful and lurid with a stellar cast, and wickedly eerie conspiracy theories. Love that this was shot in black and white, the starkness reigns.

1.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,Amazing film! It was so smbolic of the times of the latre 40s and 50s. It just goes to show how even the most ardent people are just as untrustworthy as those being accused.

1.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,"Perhaps the most twisted, mind-bending, and all around riveting political thriller ever made.

1.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,Perfectly acted (who knew Angela Lansbury could be such a bitch!?) and suspensefully paced.
1.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,Darkest movie that I have come across. The story closely follows that of the book. Keeps quite a good pace. The characters are detailed.Not typical Hollywood and not for viewers who like things formulaic.
1.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,A true visionary classic-Frankenheimer is an underappreciated genius. Laurence Harvey and Angela Lansbury are perfect and Sinatra for once is not the all powerful Sinatra. The ladies garden party scene is a masterstroke.
0.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,"It's probably because I'm not old enough to appreciate it for what it is, but I found this movie really boring. Pity, too. It was a terrific story idea."
1.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,This movie is without a doubt my favorite. It sucks you right in and won't let you go even after the ending. I absolutely love it and think it's an example of excellent storytelling and one of the very finest movies made.

1.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,Incredible movie! Angela lansbury is disturbingly dead on with her interpretation of the mother's role. The chilling plot keeps you riveted throughout and makes you wonder if this kind of thing actually happens. Must see for anyone that loves music or politics.
1.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,"Though this schizophrenic thriller was released at the height of the Cold War hysteria, it has aged very well, remaining just as thrilling now as it was more than forty years ago."

1.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,One of my favorites.
1.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,"Sinatra is so cool, and Angela Lansbury is so evil. And Raymond Shaw is stuck in the middle, passing the time by playing a little solitaire."
1.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,Intensely fascinating and quite brilliantly odd. Though I will probably never think of Mrs. Potts in the same way again...
1.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,One of the best thrillers ever. Hitchcockian in its mind games.
1.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,Beautiful in it's demented way. Compelling stuff.
1.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,one of the best i've seen. really before it's time. frank sinatra is great and angela lansbury is really creepy as the ultimate controlling mom. loved the mccarthy type senator.

1.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,"What a great movie. It so holds up over time and so much better than the new version. Angela Landsbury is so good in this movie....you have to hate her, very evil!"
1.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,"Upon second viewing, I loved it even more and now consider it a masterpiece. I found Frankenheimer's several unusual camera angles to be effective, and I'm wondering about the character of Rosie - many people think she's a Communist, and I'm suspicious too."
1.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,The brainwashing scenes are brilliant.

1.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,"Amazing, suffocating drama with Angela Lansbury (who would have thought as the manipulating, power-crazy obsessive incestuous Mom from Hell) And the guy who plays Raymond Shaw..well he's undeniably gay(-ish)...."
1.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,Tense political thriller set just at the onset of McCarthyism in the US. Karate-chopping Frank Sinatra and evil-mom Angela Lansbury stand out.

1.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,"In terms of plot twists and acting, this film manges (in black and white) to beat most modern action thrillers soundly. Features of the of three most evil female villians ever put to film ... played by, of all people, Angela Lansbury."
1.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,"One of the all time great movie villains! Angela Lansbury, gives a performance that well, ""rouses"" and blows the audiences' minds! Great camera exposition during the flashback and brainwashing sequences! A must!"
1.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,ALL HAIL ANGELA LANSBURY. Her not winning an Oscar for this is like Hitchcock never winning one: Ridiculous. Right behind Darth Vader as best villian ever.

1.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,"""The Manchurian Candidate"" is much like an Iwo Jima vet: he may be a bit old, tired, and worn, but by God the man kicked some major tail back in the day and could probably hold his own today. The granddaddy of political thrillers, and likely never to be topped."
1.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,Like this one much better than the remake. Angela Lansbury was great.
1.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,A creepy psychological thriller. It plays with your mind and keeps you on edge.

1.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,"Incredible script and acting. Frank Sinatra and Laurence Harvey are terrific. Yet, Angela Lansbury is BRILLIANT. One of the best villans in film history."
1.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,ahead of its time good
1.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,The fact that even Sinatra pulls off a good performance should tell you something about how special this movie is. Leigh steals every scene she's in and Lansbury is deliciously twisted. This is one of those movies that everyone needs to watch. At least twice.
1.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,One of the best films ever made! Angela Lansbury should have won the Oscar for best Supporting Actress.

1.0,1013227-manchurian_candidate,"Sinatra knocks it out of the park. and you have to hand it to Frankenheimer on all the wonderful 360 shots. Plus Lansbury in an evil character, you know I love that!"

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"A thrilling and lively version of the Robin Hood tale, and possibly the quintessential Errol Flynn film. The sets and melodramatic script are so hokey as to be charming. Rathbone is absolutely over the top. Huge fun to watch."

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,Was anyone ever younger and more full of life than Errol Flynn onscreen? Doesn't Olivia de Havilland's Maid Marian melt your heart? Doesn't Claude Rains define malevolence? And the musical score deserves equal billing with the lead actors!

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,My favorite Robin Hood by far!
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,Errol Flynn was the best Robin Hood ever! No amount of remakes or re-imaginings can change that. The word swashbuckler was invented for this movie. They just don't make them like this anymore.
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,The Perfect popcron movie in every way
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"Despite being tacky by 21st century standards, it is a great movie to watch in my opinion. I just love Olivia de Havilland. Errol Flynn is simply dashing and debonare, well-suited for Robin Hood. And Melville Cooper is a perfect bumbler as the Sheriff of Nottingham."

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,The ultimate Korngold score -- written before they shot a frame. Arguably the ultimate Flynn too. Claude Rains and Basil Rathbone shine. Alan Hale is hearty.
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"When someone mentions Robin Hood I automatically think of Errol Flynn. This is by far the best Robin Hood Movie ever made.

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"A wonderful movie. Errol Flynn was the perfect Robin Hood, Olivia de Havilland the perfect Marian, and together they can't be beat.

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,This is how action-adventure should be. The swordfight between Flynn and Rathbone is still one of the best in cinema history.
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"Un scÃ©nario magnifique, un dÃ©cor en carton, tout un imaginaire marquÃ© par ce film, un chef d'Å?uvre de cinÃ©ma bourrÃ© de faux raccords et de nuit amÃ©ricaine, bref de gros trucages comme on aime. Vive le cinÃ©ma qui fait rÃªver sans avoir l'exigence du rÃ©alisme."
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,Still the best silver screen telling of the Robin Hood story of all time. Flynn and de Havilland are perfect together.

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"Definitely in my top 5. Absolutley lovable characters, Errol Flynn as Robin Hood is attractive enough to turn any man gay (I am by no means gay). Friar Tuck is hilarious, and that evil old Prince John is just as wicked as you would expect. Off with his head!"

1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Next to Maltese Falcon this is the best of Bogart's film and one of the best mystery films ever. Lots of characters and twists.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,I could watch stuff like this for years.

1.0,1002352-big_sleep,It doesn't make any sense but this Noir classic is a fantastic pulp fiction experience not to be missed!The chemistry between its leads (the married Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall) is as powerful as ever and the whole thing is a blast to watch. Don't bother trying to make sense of the plot.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Depressing. But really good
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,One of the great detective movies.

1.0,1002352-big_sleep,One of my all time favorite's. Bogey's the man.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,The greatest 40's film noir mystery film by Howard Hawks. Every time I watch this film I get something more out of it every time. Great memorable scenes and definitely one of Bogarts best films.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,The chemistry between Bogart and Bacall is overshadowed only by the witty dialogue.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"A brilliant, if sometimes complicated, story of private eye Phillip Marlowe played by Bogart. Bacall co-stars. This is a classic 40s film noir, and I highly recommend it."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,THE BIG SLEEP (1946)
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Uppos vielä paremmin kun muutama vuosi sitten. Amerikkalaista elokuvaa parhaimmillaan. Uskomaton tunnelma. Loistavaa tekstiä, samalla tavalla ei ole hahmojen luonteita esitelty muissa filmeissä. Bogart ja Bacall - ehkä valkokankaan paras pari."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,One of Best Movies of All time and Humphrey Bogart is the Man
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"I have to admit, I still have no idea if the plot makes sense to me or not, but the movie is so atmospheric and the chemistry is so strong between Bogie and Bacall (obviously) that I've come to the conclusion that I don't really care if it makes sense or not."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Noir, another dead film genre. Maybe it's for the best, I don't think modern Hollywood is capable of making something this good."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Bogart is classic and as always Bacall plays off him so damn well a true classic
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Its nearly impossible to hate a movie featuring Bogart,and it gets even better,knowing that Howard Hawks directed it! An incredibly underrated film."
0.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Unbelievable characters and poor acting make this noir-esque romp a pile of rubbish. Especially when compared to say, 'The Maltese Falcon'."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Fucking brilliant. One of the landmark Film Noirs out there. Bogart does some of his best work in this film and the scenes between him and Bacall are excellent. Also one of the most badass Bogart fights happens in this one.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"The Big Sleep is the definition of a Film Noir. While it has a overly complicated plot, the screen chemistry between Bogy and Becall is the reason to watch, mainly the scenes where the dialogue goes above and beyond acting."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Brilliant stuff. Full review later.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Brilliant stuff. Full review later.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"One of the most perfect prototype detective movies. Sure the story is a little muddled, but we'll blame that on Raymond Chandler."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Nevermind how convoluted the plot is. The chemistry between the two leads is palpable, with deliciously ambiguous dialogues and latent sexuality. One of the many Hawks' masterpieces."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"One of the greatest Film Noirs of all time. With great suspense, quotable dialogue and an unforgetable chemistry between the leads (Humphery Bogart and Lauren Bacall), the Big Sleep is living proof that they don't make them like they use t"
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,My favorite so far of the noir genre.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"One of the best, not fully recognized, movies of all time with a stunning, talented cast. The chemistry on screen between Bogart and Becall has all been lost in today's movies. Whenever I have a bad day, The Big Sleep is rated up there with Ben and Jerry's and a soft pillow."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Great movie from the great Howard Hawks starring the equally great pairing of Bogart and Bacall. In general the film benefits from a great cast with Martha Vickers standing out most among the supporters. A real classic of a film which should be sought after by all fans of movies.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Yes its black and white, I'm not sure that you can beat the writing!!"
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Baserad på Raymond Chandlers bästa roman och med Bogart i sin enda film som Philip Marlowe (han borde gjort fler), med hans fru Lauren Bacall. Kemin mellan dem är elektrisk, precis som i deras första möte på vita duken i Att ha och inte ha."

1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Fantastic detective noir.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Lauren Bacall's debut film -- very fun adventure.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Bogart and Bacall practically sizzle in this film. And Howard Hawks tells a fantastic detective story on top of that. Truly one of the all time greats.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,My #1 movie of all time. Bogart and Bacall at their best. Complicated story with lots of twists and turns. One of a very select few movies that I watch over and over again.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"The plot ceases to make sense at some point, but frame by frame and scene for scene the frisson, the humor, the coolness add up to a Bogie-Bacall and Howard Hawks masterwork."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,One of the greatest movies I've ever had to the privilege to enjoy.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Classic noir film. No wasted dialogue, very witty and loaded with double entendres. Plot is convoluted, but adds to the intrique of the movie. Bogart and Bacall never better. Unresolved murder unusual for those days."

1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"My favorite of all the hard-boiled noirs, Bogart here shows how truly great screen actors can get across an entire character in a single gesture and knowing grin."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Tremendous entertainment with one of the most convoluted plots ever in a Hollywood movie - even the writer admitted he didn't know who committed one murder! But who cares with this lightning pace and great dialouge.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"The direction, music, cinematography, screenplay and performances are all flawless, and make for one of the best film noirs ever made."

1.0,1002352-big_sleep,One of the essential film noir
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"This is a true classic. The plot is both riveting and ridiculously complex, the dialogue is razor sharp and, of course, its got Humphrey Bogart, who is the epitome of cool."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Brilliant. Smart and funny dialogue and an excellent cast really help this detective story come to life. Just make sure you pay attention to what is going on.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Absolutely one of my favorites. Bogart and Bacall actually reshot one of the scenes a year later having been married in the interim. Some of the plot is so convoluted as to be incomprehensible. Somehow it all suits the noir underpinnings and carries me away. I love it and watch it time and again.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"a film noir masterpiece, Bogart and Bacall are electric. Wonderful, Wonderful dialouge one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen."

1.0,1002352-big_sleep,There is no dick like Marlowe! and there is no Marlowe like Bogart
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"After countless viewings AND reading the book, I still couldn't tell you what happened. As The Big Sleep will attest, who needs a plot when you have atmosphere, attitude, drug-addled teenage nymphomaniacs, and one of the greatest couples in history?"
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"The Big Sleep is a stylish ""Film Noir"" with a fast paced and confusing plot. However, the sharp dialogue and strong chemistry between Bogart and Bacall will make this a hugely enjoyable experience, whether you understand it or not."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,You simply won't find a better script!
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"The story is a bit confusing, and it is too long, but for only the sparks between Bacall and Bogart, and the ending, this is a great film."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Humphrey is very bad motherfucker in this film!!!
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"It doesn't make sense, but it doesn't matter."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Bacall and Bogart are a match made in heaven
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"So far, my favorite noir film. Bogart and Bacall are, of course, amazing. The witty dialog is fast, furious, and fantastic."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Don't even try to follow the plot, just sit back and enjoy the fantastic dialogue and sizzling chemistry of Bogart and Bacall."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,That never happens to me in book shops!
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Wonderful, beautiful, perfect. Everything you could want from a film"
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,A classic of film noir. Some great sarcastic dialog.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Awesome! Both the 1945 and 1946 versions leave me wanting more. ""Doghouse"" Marlow is one of my favorite movie characters of all time. He's tough, smart, and intrigues the females. This film has action, suspense, and drama all mixed in one glass. Another classic brought you by the great Howard Hawks."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,The way Bogart talks to women is awesome.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,The best Bogart film? It has my vote.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"One of my all time fav noirs. Howard Hawks directing, that Bogart-Bacall magic, the black and white cinematography...it's a movie orgasm!"
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Much more enjoyable than Maltese Falcon
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Classic film noir son. Don't sleep or you'll lose the plot.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Incredible. The prototypical detective movie...they don't get any better.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Hawks made it as twisted and pointless as the novel: perfect. W/out which, would we have all these Coen Bros movies? Probably not."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Probably the greatest film noir ever, definitely the best of Bogie and Bacall which says something! Also the best adaptation of Raymond Chandler. Everyone should see this movie."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"It's a great film noir with fantastic dialogue. The plot is confusing, but you can understand the gist of it."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,I love this film. But don't ask me to tell you what it's about.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,One of the absolute best!
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Bogarts almost as crazy as the bad guy! Extraordinary chemistry between Bogart and Bacall.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"The best hard boiled detective film ever. Bogart is badass throughout and Bacall is his equal in all respects. This is the best of Noir films, and everyone should see it at some point."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,AMAZING! CLASSIC!! TERRIFIC!!! BRILLIANT!!!! FANTASTIC!!!!! More adjectives I could go on and on until I ran out
0.0,1002352-big_sleep,It lived up to it's name.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Perhaps the best adaptation of a Raymon Chandler book committed to screen, helped i guess by him working on the script. Bogart and Bacall sizzle and lets face it all us guys would like to be as harnosed and arrogant as Marlow and still get the dame. Noir and classic."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,You want good on-screen chemistry? look no further than Bogart and Bacall. This is one of the better movies where they are opposite one another. It's also a much better Bogart-as-detective story than The Maltese Falcon.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,The King and Queen of effortless cool...if only i looked as good in a hat as Bogart
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"What do you want, for me to count to three like they do in the movies?"
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"essential noir, plot makes the most sense the 3rd time"
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Do yourself a favor: read Raymond Chandler.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Love this damn thing.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Possibly one of the best Noir movies ever.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,The performance by Bogie and Bacall is so incredible and sizzling that you forget how fucking convoluted the plot was.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Classic detective story with two of Hollywoods heavy weights from the 1940s, the film drips with style and pinache."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"One of the classics. Bogart completely defines coolness in this must-see film noir. Bacall... toughness, feminity and talent."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,bogie and lauren bacall are absolutely fantastic.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"One of the greatest pieces of noire in history. Bogart plays Marlowe to the letter in this tale of Bullets,Broads and numerous Betrayls. Chandler's fiction will never see a greater adaptation."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"The chemistry between Bogey and Bacall is truly amazing in this film. Plus, the plot is so much nicer. One of my favorites."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,The coolest movie of all time.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,You want to know what film noir is? This is film noir!!!
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,A shining example of the best of noir. Bogart plays an excellent badass with plenty of excellent one-liners sprinkled throughout. The plot is intriguing and the characters are compelling up to the last frame. It's a shame this movie doesn't get the full credit it deserves.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Another candidate for ""best noir movie ever""."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,My favorite movie of all time.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"This is one of my favourite movies. Bogart and Bacall just sizzle, the dialogue is great, and the plot keeps moving. Classic detective movie. This one set the standard very high. A must see for all fans of classic film."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,One of my all-time favorites for sure. They dont' make movies like this anymore.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Boggie and Becal at their steamiest. Hawks has produced a masterful albeit an esoteric noir.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Bogart and Becall. What a team they make. This is my favorite movie with them together. It is very suspenseful and involving.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Undoubtedly confusing film, with more twists than an out of work showgirl's last pair of stockings... but extraordinary for its slick self assurance, dazzling repartee, and the unmistakeable chemistry between Bacall and Bogart."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,one of my favorites. bogart=god
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,lauren bacall is my favorite. she = real woman.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,If I've ever wanted to be some body else it's Bogart. On my best days I couldn't smoke that many cigarettes and drink that much whiskey.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Boggy as a private dick hired not by Bacall as stated in the Flixster review but by her father. Sex, pornographic pictures, drugs and guns...1946 movie ahead of its time. Cool and dark"
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Probably my favorite Bogart film... and Bacall is awesome in it as well; a refinement on To Have and Have Not. Non-stop dry humor and a pretty wild plot make this a must-see film noir film.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Film Noir is the best genre of all time, and this is the best film noir movie, no matter what people say. Plus Humphrey Bogart is the manliest man of all"
1.0,1019544-spartacus,"In my opinion, this should have been the most successful film ever at the academy Awards. It should have won almost all of the awards. One of the best films ever made."
1.0,1019544-spartacus,One of essential of epic roman movies. Kirk Douglas is astonishing so unforgetable as the iconic hero and liberator.
1.0,1019544-spartacus,"Kubrick's most underrated film, (which is curiously one of the best) presents us with the great vision of the director of the history of Spartacus.The performance of Kirk Douglas along with the handling of the story make this film a jewel of epic cinema, to the caliber of Ben-Hur or Quo-Vadis."
1.0,1019544-spartacus,Another classic from Mr. Kubrick.
1.0,1019544-spartacus,Epic classic. On Blu-ray and part of The Criterion Collection on DVD.
1.0,1019544-spartacus,"'Spartacus' is a classic that will rouse you with its epic tale of fighting for freedom, regardless of whether you like oysters or snails."
1.0,1019544-spartacus,"I forgot how great the acting is in this movie. Even though Kubrick later disowned the movie, I still consider it to be one of his bests."
1.0,1019544-spartacus,"A Kirk Douglas vanity project and plagued by production woes, this ambitious cinematic feat turns out to be stirring of epic proportions with no small aid from the writing by Dalton Trumbo, the sweeping score by Alex North and its cinematographic grandeur."
1.0,1019544-spartacus,A perfect film. Love every second of it!
1.0,1019544-spartacus,"Excellent addition to Kubricks catalog, and sword and sandals alike. Great acting, great screenplay, and epic soundtrack"
1.0,1019544-spartacus,With some action scenes and performances it serves to be a fine epic movie.
0.0,1019544-spartacus,Worth watching. Can't believe Stanley Kubrick was the replacement director. Jean Simmons was really beautiful.
1.0,1019544-spartacus,"Comparing the classical epics is hard, but adding the brilliance of Kubrick to one pushes Spartacus over the top in a big way."

1.0,1019544-spartacus,"The story of Spartacus has been told countless times, but what all other versions lack are Kirk Douglas' engaging performance in the title role and Stanley Kubrick's innovative direction."
1.0,1019544-spartacus,"Sweeping, visionary epic"
1.0,1019544-spartacus,"It's odd witnessing Kubrickean technique with the swords-and-sandals epic genre, but Spartacus is one graceful portrayal of leadership and defiance accompanied by the depth of Roman politics."
1.0,1019544-spartacus,that was awesome .. the slave who fought for freedom died seeing his free wife with his free son .. the end can summarize this amazing film
1.0,1019544-spartacus,Nothing more than great a+++++++

1.0,1019544-spartacus,"Incredible film from Kubrick, so detailed, everything on an epic scale and some excellent acting performances all around - a must watch"
1.0,1019544-spartacus,"Okay, so slave girls probably didn't look like Jean Simmons stepping out of a beauty salon, but this remains an incredible film. Triumphant and tragic, hopeful and cautionary. If you don't get teary eyed when Simmons shows the crucified Spartacus his son at the end, you may not be human."
1.0,1019544-spartacus,Kirk Duglass classic
1.0,1019544-spartacus,"It is surprising that hardly anyone realizes that this is a Kubrick film. It does have his style, it is just hard to pick up because the film was very much like the epics released at the time (I.E. El Cid, Ben-Hur, The Ten Commandments)."
1.0,1019544-spartacus,A Great movie star studded cast

1.0,1019544-spartacus,"A truly epic story, wonderfully acted with convincing action without having to rely on the stylized action of other, more modern renditions."
1.0,1019544-spartacus,Probably perfect movie. Shot on 65mm gave stunning picture. Great light and colors... Perfectly enjoyable 3-hours even in 2012 :)
1.0,1019544-spartacus,The only special effect being that you can believe it - save for the lack of sweat among the militarily superior and morally inferior Romans

1.0,1019544-spartacus,"This epic about the inevitable decline of the Roman Republic (and the Empire's rise) was a well-done masterpiece that will live in my collection until the end of time.It currently sits in my Blu-Ray collection with The Godfather, Blade Runner, and other classics and new films."

1.0,1019544-spartacus,"A very moving and compelling story of epic proportions. The plot is relentless, propelled by a dazzling screenplay.

1.0,1019544-spartacus,"Coming long before either Braveheart or Gladiator, Spartacus is on par with their scale and might, but still stands uniquely on its own as a great epic"
1.0,1019544-spartacus,"One of the best ""epic"" movies ever made and it holds up very well even today. Also, it's pretty damn cool. Before ""Braveheart"" and then ""Gladiator"", there was 30+ years of ""Spartacus"" being the go-to movie when it came to epic bad-assery."
1.0,1019544-spartacus,"This rousing, action-packed Roman epic is unmatched in the genre. Born of Kirk Douglas' failure to win the title role in William Wyler's Oscar-feted Ben Hur, this iconic piece of cinema benefits hugely from having Stanley Kubrick at the helm. A true classic."

1.0,1019544-spartacus,"a historical saga and a cinematic marvel of unbound proportions, its story of moral integrity and courageous conviction still hold true, it reminded me of another great movie Braveheart, it is a thinking persons movie, but a movie yet worth watching."
1.0,1019544-spartacus,Kirk Douglass was the toughest son of a bitch after Sinatra and Bogart and Mitchum and Cagney and... well he was pretty tough.
1.0,1019544-spartacus,stands the test of time. i cry every time i watch the scene where spartacus fights antoninus. two people who really love each other and are in such a desperate position that they can express it only by trying to kill one another. incredible film.

1.0,1019544-spartacus,"Kirk Douglas' classic of action, love, and courage."
1.0,1019544-spartacus,Films dont get much better than this. Probably Kirk Douglas's greatest movie. Olivier and Laughton steal the show though. One question though Who cast Tony Curtis!!!!!

1.0,1019544-spartacus,"The ultimate swords and sandals epic, also has an interesting subplot on how Caesar came to power."
1.0,1019544-spartacus,The very definition of EPIC
1.0,1019544-spartacus,Kirk Dougas en jupette ? Rien que pour ca ce film vaut le deplacement ! Et puis c'est quand meme Kubrick a la realisation... Puis l'histoire e Spartacus est tellement belle.
1.0,1019544-spartacus,"Kubrick's last ""hollywood"" effort is also his most complete movie. A perfect example of two clashing giants (Kubrick and the studio) coming together to make the finest epic on celluloid."

1.0,1019544-spartacus,"I like to watch this movie with Peter Graves. On a serious note, great movie. Great political ideas."

1.0,1019544-spartacus,"A great movie. Today, with all the CGIs they have, they still can't come close to this. My other impression is how much Kirk, at this age, looked like his son."

1.0,gone_with_the_wind,A All Time Classic Movie
1.0,gone_with_the_wind,This film shows us a fantastic perspective of an inner struggle within Scarlett O'hara where we get to witness a story of happiness and dispair for a woman who wants nothing but happiness and in return recieves a lifelong lesson where there is truly no place like home!
0.0,gone_with_the_wind,2/10A movie so bad it probably started WWII
1.0,gone_with_the_wind,Long and a little drawn out in places but the cast and acting make up for it.
0.0,gone_with_the_wind,"Too long. Too sappy. TOO HEARTBREAKING! This was a HUGE disappointment. I bought this movie, hoping that I would be watching something DECENT! All in all, I don't recommend it at all. The only good part is Clark Gable"
1.0,gone_with_the_wind,"The thing that makes ""Gone with the wind"" such a classic, is partly Scarlett O'Hara & her volatility, which was great that time, and also the grand scope is so overwhelming on a person. This film is truly a masterpiece of cinema, and a epic feast for the eyes. ."

1.0,gone_with_the_wind,"Despite the length of this film, I never find it boring. Vivian Leigh is perfectly cast as the catty, strong-willed Scarlet. Deserving of every award and accolade, Gone With The Wind never disappoints with its gorgeous photography, color, acting, and passion."

1.0,gone_with_the_wind,"Love this film, all time classic"
1.0,gone_with_the_wind,The greatest love story of all time because it is almost reality instead of your average fairy tales. Such is life. Too much wisdom from Rhett Butler' s lines as well. You can never get enough of the precious 222 minutes. One still yearns to demand more!! Inspiring. Hurtful. Daring.
1.0,gone_with_the_wind,BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!:)
1.0,gone_with_the_wind,An absolute classic of the old world with an impossibly good performance from Vivien Leigh. Full review later.
1.0,gone_with_the_wind,A true classic in every way. Probably two of the most tragic characters ever portrayed. They do everything to make the audience dislike them but their circumstances and the depth and complexity given to them by Gable and Leigh make them two of the most memorable characters in film history.
1.0,gone_with_the_wind,Absolutely epic in scale while staying totally human. Gone with the End is truly a great picture
1.0,gone_with_the_wind,wonderful movie ð???
1.0,gone_with_the_wind,Definitely a great movie. I just finished the book yesterday and started it on Thanksgiving 2014. I like the book better because it does explain the story better so you understand the movie better.

1.0,gone_with_the_wind,"Amazing gust of a film. Brilliant performance on all corners. Vivien Leigh in her iconic role as Scarlett O'Hara, Clark Gable as rebellious Rhett Butler. Kudos to David O'Selznick for a goliath, showstopper of a film."
1.0,gone_with_the_wind,"Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler are one of the most remarkable characters of the history of cinema. Scarlett is selfish and hateful, but she and Rhett have such a chemistry together."

1.0,gone_with_the_wind,"The chemistry between Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) and Scarlet O'Hara (Vivian Leigh) was nothing short of electrifying. Made some 70 years ago, when CGI was non existent, this epic film is the penultimate romance legend that continues to burn brightly."
1.0,gone_with_the_wind,"Sweeping, magnificent, timeless, and breathtaking in every way. I watched this movie every weekend for a very long time; it's one of the select few films that gets better and better every time I watch it.

1.0,gone_with_the_wind,"Gone with the Wind gives a verbatim definition to the great American romance while being one of the first films to recognize that not every love story ends with perfection.

1.0,1017293-rebecca,"This Hitchcock movie had me from start to end. It has it all - a psychological mystery thriller with romance, and secrets.

1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Alfred Hitchcock's first American film, Rebecca, is a brilliant, almost other-worldly thriller. The basic premise is of a Second Wife (Joan Fontaine) who lives in the shadow of the memory of her predecessor, Rebecca. Part of the brilliance of the film is how a character"
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"I absolutely adore this one (obviously- 5-star rating, hello!) Joan Fontaine was fabulous, as was Laurence Olivier. This one is brilliant, especially since this was Hitchcock's first Hollywood fim. (1940) :)"

1.0,1017293-rebecca,Absolutely amazing. Olivier was a beast. Anderson was deliciously creepy and devious. And Hitchcock? Amazing as always.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"It is sad that such a great director was never honored with a personal Oscar win. Sure this movie won Best Production, but Hitchcock really should have won Best Direction."

1.0,1017293-rebecca,"I love this movie, it has a real classic Gothic feel to it, which was fairly rare for Hitchcock (though becomes less surprising when you realize it's based on a Daphne du Maurier story). Spooky and atmospheric greatness."

1.0,1017293-rebecca,I was pleasantly shocked about how close the movie stuck to the book. It was a good movie!
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Maybe one of Hitch's greatest. Both Joan Fontaine and Sir Laurence give great performances, but the real showstopper is that mansion, and the lighting/shadows, and the camera work ... fantastic! Oh, and the plot is very good too..."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,I love old black and white movies. This one is my favorite of them all! I love the guys swagger in this movie..I love men with smooth ass swagger.

1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Classic Hitch. It was his first American made film. It won Selznick his 2nd Oscar in a row after GWTW. The perfect cast gives perfect performances. My fave Olivier role. He's dripping with sophistication, yet he has this lost boy layer underneath. And Mrs. Danvers? The ultimate embodiment of evil."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Excellent film. Olivier and Hitchcock? Simply amazing.

1.0,1017293-rebecca,"it's not the book, but it does keep you on the edge of your seat."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,creo que es lo mas parecido a un cuento de hadas que hizo Hitchcock pero aun así no deja de tener todos los elementos que nos mantiene en suspenso al borde de la silla

1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Wonderful piece from Alfred Hitchcock in his first Hollywood movie, adapted from Daphne Du Maurier's much-loved novel. Despite not having the shock and suspense of his later work, this still shows Hitchcock as the master of the atmospheric movie."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Suspense in spades. Mrs. Danvers. Brrrrrrrr! Joan Fontaine cringing and cowering. And what an ensemble cast: Laurence Olivier, George Sanders, Gladys Cooper, Nigel Bruce, C. Aubrey Smith. With Hitchcock directing and David O. Selznick overmanaging every detail."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Though it's not really typical Hitchcock that people are used to, it's a wonderful movie! What woman doesn't compare herself to a former spouse, especially a deceased one who was beloved by all? We should all wish to NEVER have a housekeeper like Mrs. Danvers!"
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Being realistic, I think Ive seen this movie about 65 times this year because I never get sick of it. Not only showing how pathetic I am, but showing how great this movie is :P"
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Vintage Hitchcock, nothing more to say!! A B&W; classic. Even though u dont get to see who Rebecca is, but you feel her thro' out the movie. A great psychological thriller. Watch out the scene where the new wife is persuaded to commit suicide by Mrs. Denvers. Hitchcock @ his best!"
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Beautifully sinister and understated Hitchcock masterpiece about grief and obsession.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Simply awesome. Laurence Olivier is really everything is cracked up to be and so is Hitchcock. I have not seen Joan Fontaine in many films but she was great in this.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,One of my top 3 movies ever...........and my favorite Hitchcock movie. Joan Fontaine is perfect in this movie.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"It's not one of my favorite Hitchcock films (I prefer the psychological complexity of Vertigo or Shadow of a Doubt), but Rebecca is without a doubt one of his most solid, well-concieved, and flat-out best."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"After Rear Window, this is my favorite Hitchcock movie!! Hitchcock has done an amazing job directing the adaptation of this timeless novel..."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"I think this is the best movie Hitchcock made and he made some good ones. it's also an excelent adaptation of the novel, even though some important things are changed it is forgivable if the result is this masterpiece"

1.0,1017293-rebecca,one of the all-time best Hitchcock thrillers!
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"So much fun, but still sophisticated. You wouldn't know Hitchcock directed it without seeing the credits, for it lacks his usual tight structure and other trademarks. However, the eerieness never lets up. Mrs. Danvers is the creepiest craziest person ever- and I love her for it!"
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Fantastic Hitchcock film. Loved it!
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"hitchcock's first american film! it's just beautifully made and a really fun story. george sanders is his usual sleazy ambiguously gay self, and olivier is just a fucking fox."

1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Yes, Larry Olivier did Hitchcock! Most bizarre!"
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"So after seeing this, I think that Vertigo, North by Northwest, and now Rebecca are my favorite Hitchcock films."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Hitchcocks bÃ¤sta film!
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"AMAZING movie. As if Laurence Oliver's being in it doesn't already make it a 5-star movie, it has a GREAT storyline. Rebecca-- SEE IT."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"This movie is why Alfred Hitchcock is my favorite director, Hitchcocks finest film. Wonderful musical score, mysterious and haunting. I just love films and B&W; and Alfred Hitchcock was a genius at directing which makes it a treat when watching his films."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"An early masterpiece from Hitchcock. I'm ashamed that I hadn't seen it until now, it won best picture for a reason. It seems to not have aged, and the acting and cinematography is spectacular. Very highly recommended!"
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"I prefer a lot of the older Hitchcock works--I think they're overlooked because they're not in color, but Rebecca has all the drama and suspense of Vertigo. Plus, it opens with a model shot, and I always love those."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Incredible book - incredible movie.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,this movie literally hypnotized me... it was creepy and beautiful and there was not a moment i guessed right
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Again, brilliant. This may be my favorite Hitchcock film actually."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,one of the best films of the master
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Great movie! Mrs. Danvers is terrifying, and the story is wonderful!"
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Another great Hitchcock film. Suspenseful. Based on book by Daphne DuMaurier.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Fell in love with Joan Fontaine for a while after seeing this for the first time. It was the start of my fascination with golden age cinema and with Hitchcock. I love this film, and it has the best name of all time - George Fortesque Maximilian De Winter."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,The storyline is very tense and I think the mannerisms of each character are very accurate in terms of establishing the very distinctive role they have in the film.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,I love Hitchcock and this is my favorite movie of all time.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,my favorite Hitchcock film.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"This somehow gets forgotten amidst the flashy 50's and 60's Hitchcocks, but. This is really one of his spooky best... With one of the most chilling bad-guys (Mrs. Danvers) in movies."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Loved it. Again, the lovely Jon Fontaine!"
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Based on the novel by Daphne Du Maurier, this ""modern Gothic"" is the only Hitchcock film to win Best Picture. Laurence Olivier is perfect and never handsomer as Maxim de Winter, and Joan Fontaine steals your heart as his mousy new wife, but Judith Anderson is haunting as Mrs. Danvers."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"this is in the top 10 fave. movies for me. so suspenseful, fantastic ending !!"
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Excellent film with a dead woman running the show seemingly. Joan Fontaine as the no name bride of Maxwell DeWinter (Laurence Olivier) who's dead wife haunts him. But Why????

1.0,1017293-rebecca,An absolute classic! My favorite movie of all time!
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"This is class, the character rebecca is alive in this film and the best is the evil in the shadows portrayed by Housekeeper Mrs Danvers. Brilliant."

1.0,1017293-rebecca,"love the book, and now the this movie! Though not like the book but still good"

1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Great film, I love it!"
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Wow, this is great. It follows the book pretty closely and is absolutely haunting."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,What a great movie! And it's Hitchcock. I love that they never name the 2nd Mrs. DeWinter. Love these classics!
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Judithh Anderson is terrifying and sinister as the obsessive housekeeper, Mrs Danvers. A wonderful adaptation of the du Maurier novel."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Without a doubt Hitchcock's most unique film. Creepy, beautiful, and wonderfully mysterious; not only absorbs you in a character who never once appears on screen, but in the others who do as well. Magnificent."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"actores insuperables, dirección magistral, el suspense sutil y tremendo del amor..."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Hitchcock is the best!!!...
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"great book from daphne du maurier, read it!"
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"A great classic, dramatic, scary. Loved the set. The actress as the maid did a great job."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,What a creepy movie. I like it.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Wonderful Hitchcock and so subtly creepy. One of my favorites, not only because of the terrific script and acting by the leads, but of Mrs. Danvers. What a haunting impression this woman leaves on you."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"A perfect adaptation of Daphne Du Maurier's gothic classic! Olivier and Fontaine made for a superb cast, and the entire movie from start to finish was every bit as tense, thrilling and gripping as the book. You cant go wrong with Hitchcock I guess."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Classicly creepy. Its probably my favorite Hitchcock
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Atmospheric & dark. The protrayal of Mrs Danvers is truly chilling. Joan Fontaine was perfectly cast in this movie.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,my favorite film ever
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"The best foreign film I've watched, thus far. Its so good that writing a review would take too much time, but let me just say this: This is a film EVERY person should watch and a film that will still be important a CENTURY from now."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Erich von Stroheim was as always superb in this movie. Thank you Jean Renoir for this beautiful film with such a great message.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the most crucial and humanist of films.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Simple yet emotionally complex. An anti-war story about patriotism, war, brotherhood and humanity. La Grande Illusion served as an influence to many future filmmakers dealing with the topic of war. Sad, funny and moving all at once!"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the best movies of all time. I've never had such a strong urge to watch a movie a second time right after seeing it.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A terrific masterpiece that should be known and watched by everyone. Its important anti-war message, along with powerful topics such as friendship and humanity, makes this film an essential viewing experience. A masterful classic that will continue to be admired and studied in years to come."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Greatest Foreign Language anti-war movie, aside from being a great movie on its own terms. Admirable restoration!"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Like All Quiet on the Western Front, this film is still one of the best war films ever made."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"One of the few films that rank among the best of any art form. Shocking and brave for it's time, the progressive ideology of the film is more progressive than most films out today."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"An incredible film, with such a brilliant message and such a well thought out manner of portraying it that it deserves its place as one of the greatest films ever made."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Classic perfect film. Old film that is entertaining enough for modern filmgoers to enjoy throughly. For those who may want to watch the film more studiously pay attention to how the film deals with its major themes (race, class, war)."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"An arrestingly humanistic, anti-war masterwork, in part thanks to the camera's light and calm motion."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,It's a beautiful film. Not just for the way it looks but what it says & how it moves.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,There's a reason this is always listed among the best film's ever made. It is. The restoration brings Renoir's perfect cinematography to new clarity. Von Stroheim's performance is quietly elegant. You cannot call yourself a film fan until you see this.

1.0,la_grande_illusion,"simple story with characters both subtle and heartfelt, it's timeless, moving, and easy to love."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,A classic that moves one on many levels. See it if it's playing nearby.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Jean Renoir aims high with this film. Renoir exceeds this and he doesn't miss a beat. After you watch this film, you feel so emotionally drained. Outstanding achievement in telling the story and cinematography. Just as political as it is emotional. My personal 2nd favorite film ever."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Brilliant film. Nuff said
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Admit it: you wish you could be as cool as Jean Gabin.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,The 75th Anniversary restoration is absolutely beautiful. Grand Illusion is a powerful and unforgettable film.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,My first (movie) Criterion that I purchased. How can a guy forget his first?
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Le monde change devant nos yeux. Film absolument superbe!
1.0,la_grande_illusion,[i]Review coming soon.[/i]
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Probably the most fun I've ever had with an anti-war film. Renoir's film is rich in flair, thematic material and humor, and earns every right to be considered one of the most important films of all time. Casa Blanca, took more than a few cues from this."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Perhaps not Renoir's most radical film, but in my opinion his most moving, about the dislocations created by war and the at times futile struggles of men to stay somehow connected--to friends, to social classes, to lost conventions."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Oh sweet Jesus, so much deep focus. Such a good story. Such great directing. Sublime acting. I LOVE IT!"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Sublime, serene, and elegiac. I watch this once a year and that may not be enough. I'm not sure what's more sad: the horrors of war, or trying to place a gentleman's agreement on top of the whole mess. A true 10-star masterpiece."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Great Jean Renoir war film about officers and the death of the nobility in World War 1. Renoir is one of the best directors of all time, and this is one of his best movies."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,ExperiÃªncia cinematografica cinco estrelas. Um filme que quase desapareceu da histÃ³ria do cinema mundial.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A beautiful, subtle, humane, enormously influential look at war, the people who fight on both sides, and a system of the world that was inexorably on its way out, for better and for worse."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Renoir is easily one of the greatest directors of all time
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Jean Renoirs La Grande Illusion er intet mindre enn ett tidlÃ¸st mesterverk! Jean Gabin, Pierre Fresnay og Erich Von Stroheim spiller hovedrollene i dette episke verket om vennskap og aristokrati. En klassiker!"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Grand Illusion is a timeless peace of cinema forever ensured to be remembered generation by generation. It`s just a remarkable film you have to experience for yourself.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"I love that the original P.O.W film is the one that manages to break the stereotypes, the WW1 setting also adds an extra dimension awesome"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,c juste trop grandiose!!!
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A magnificent film which questions the very nature of our social and ethnic divisions. Offers in the grimmest of contexts, when all the divisive prejudices have sunk along with all prior notions of civilization, the possibility for a new model of pacifism, humanism and egalitarianism to emerge."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Very exciting and extremely ingenious
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"It's a curious film. The title is purposely misleading. The ""illusion"" doesn't have to do with escaping from any POW camp."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A very layered, and thoughtful work. Fantastic use of a disjointed 3-act structure. I think I prefer to The Rules of the Game. 9.5/10"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Never have I seen an Anti-War film so impressionable; one of the deepest, most critical films of its century."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,one of the 10 greatest films I have ever seen...
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A intelligent and subtle way of expressing the fear of war through the people effected by it. Some directors today still feel righteous to show heroism during war, where in fact Renoir's anti war message is considerably more apt."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Renoir is the bomb. A prison camp film from WWI with a unique perspective. Finely acted and thought provoking.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,There are some minor flaws but mostly this is incredible. Good on him for making it right before WWII. It's shocking how much The Great Escape steals from this movie.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"My favorite Renoir, and starring the great Jean Gabin and Erich von Stroheim"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,A fantastic war film that has had a clear influence on nearly every other escape movie since.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Fantastic film from Renoir! I was shocked and a bit moved by the scene where the prisoners of war find pleasure in looking at women's clothing. Just one of many scenes that make this a rare and unbeatable war film.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"There are so many good things about this movie. The cast is perfect for a start. The guts Renoir showed in making it. The arc of the story. The triumph and tragedy of it's characters. And Erich Von Stroheim, what a guy!"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,The best french movie ever made?
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"The first ""P.O.W. Escape"" movie, and by far the best"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the best films ever.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Truly powerful, poignant, and moving."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"der film hat mir sehr gefallen, will mehr filme von renoir sehen. erich von stroheim ist ja auch in sunset bv."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,It's amazing how real this movie feels.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,I had forgotten how flabbergastingly great this thing is. Just astonishing. Renoir's introduction is a must.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,I saw this in my TFM class and it's one of the oldies but goodies. Really romance driven.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A beautifully optimistic tribute to human nature in the face of the tragic idiocy (or ""grand illusion"") of nationalism, class, ""duty"", politics and everything else that divides us."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,An amazing film with some very amusing moments. A classic must-see Jean Renoir film!
1.0,la_grande_illusion,a testament to humanity in the midst of war
0.0,la_grande_illusion,"When you really sit down and talk about it, World War is silly, don't you think? I mean, instead of fighting we could, I don't know, be drinking wine or eating cheese . . ."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"The most unique WWI film I have seen. No attempt to show the trenches, but the relationships of people. I enjoyed, hmm-mmm."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"I hadn't seen this in years! This is a newly restored version, and it's poetry. Lots of movies demonstrate that war is hell, but this is a rare movie that says that war can bring out the best in an individual."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the greatest films ever made!
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Nice little ""surviving adversity"" film with a sorta/kinda happy ending. Oh, wait...what's this subplot about class? Or antisemitism? Or relationships transcending politics/class/language? WTF! Why is all this serious stuff in my entertainment?"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"If this isn't the greatest movie ever made, it's certainly in the top 20. There is layer upon layer of subtext and social commentary in this film, on top of a pretty gripping story. It's much more than a POW film, and it's worth seeing at least once in a lifetime."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,A great anti war film. GW would ban it if he could...
1.0,la_grande_illusion,the great classic. everyone should have seen it
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the best movies of all time!
1.0,la_grande_illusion,You've heard of this for a reason. It's one of the best films ever made. It's silly to say anything more. But it certainly holds up more than well.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A very nice, fun film. It deals with everything from war to class to race in a prison camp environment. A classic brilliant film."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Consistently number one or two on my list of greatest films of all time. Pure cinematic poetry. Unforgettable.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"An amazing, deeper-than-expected film by Jean Renoir. It's a complex look at war, and the fracturing and bringing together that it is capable of. Humor is wisely weaved in, and with a superb cast, this film tackles the war with whole-hearted conviction."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A beautiful film in many ways. Renoir's constantly moving camera provides the film with a wonderful kineticism. I was surprised at how funny the film was, which works in its favor and makes its anti-war message that much more poignant."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"My favorite movie of all time. Probably one of the earlier anti-war films, it takes place, mostly, in a prisoner-of-war camp during WWI, and depicts the class struggle on both sides of the conflict."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Most nuanced war movie I've ever seen. Incredible.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,un chef d'oeuvre : humour a la Audiard avant Audiard et humanité en temps de guerre. magnifique
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"If we through Bogart and Gable in this bad boy we have the Beatles of early sound film. This all star cast and amazing director combine powers to create a film that has stood the test of time for over 70 years. Erich von Stroheim is the coolest sad, old man in the history of cinema... maybe."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,The 86% of people 'not interested' in seeing this film should be ashamed.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Something that great films have in common is that they stretch across more than 3 acts. There is a reason why most critics include this film in their 'top 5' list of greatest films.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the greatest war movies ever.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"fabulous. lots of later 50s war films (great escape, colditz story) are copies of this. class, ethics, camaraderie, friendship, love. in the usual, surprisingly 'modern' style of all Renoir's films and the French 'c'est la vie' realistic attitude. I BLOODY LOVE RENOIR FILMS"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the best movies ever made
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Probably the best war movie ever. Steve McQueen's ""Great ""Escape"" was a dumbed-down version of this film. There are class struggles, castle escapes, WWI tearing apart Europe, solitary."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Absolument merveilleux sur le plan humain.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A movie for all time about man-made caste systems, ethnic and country divisions. Questions the true nature of honor."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Powerful movie... one of the 3 best films I've ever seen (with Citizen Kane and The Godfather Pt. II). Gabin is incredible! I used to have the Criterion Collection DVD of this film; sadly, I sold it a couple of years ago."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Hitler called it Cinematic public enemy number one. Amazing stuff, heavily borrowed by Casablanca but a richer film that is the true father of all anti-war movies"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A magnificent film which questions the very nature of our social and ethnic divisions. Offers in the grimmest of contexts, when all the divisive prejudices have sunk along with all prior notions of civilization, the possibility for a new model of pacifism, humanism and egalitarianism to emerge."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,AWESOME! I loved it. I think Professor Dine-Young for having film class watch it because sadly I would have never picked it up on my own.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,the passing of the old guard
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A war film where only 1 shot is fired. This, Paths Of Glory & The Deer Hunter are the finest films about the absurdity & horror of war --if you ask me."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A grand masterpiece with a great trio of actors, Jean Gabin, Fresnay and Stroheim. A must see anti-war movie."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Ultimately through the visuals of the endless, snowcovered, Swiss Alps Renoir teaches the viewer that the borders humans create are not recognized by nature, but rather just a grand illusion."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"""Frontiers are an invention of men. Nature doesn't give a hoot."""
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Le film pacifiste par excellence. Il raconte la fin d'un monde, prophetise les horreurs de la deuxieme guerre mondiale qui s'annoncait a l'epoque, tout en affirmant l'humanite de tous les etres humains, sans exception. Les pseudo-pacificistes de notre epoque devraient en prendre de la graine..."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,To all you people who spend your afternoons writing long reviews of various Jennifer Lopez romantic comedies: You goddamn peasants wouldn't good cinema if it shot you in the face.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"renior's son as director. awesome, scary monicale guy was tight."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Are you kidding me?! One of the best films ever made. Beautiful film, I could go on for minutes about how lovely this film is. Stroheim is fantastic!"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the best war films I have ever seen. Well worth a watch or two.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Not optimistic. The way I like my movies. lol.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,A classic...a pacifist tale about being a prisoner during WW1 and written just before WW2...still very modern
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Ultra classique, cette oeuvre pacifique a reconcilie le temps d'un film la gauche et la droite des annees 30, qui pourtant se detestaient plus que Sarkozy et Laguiller. C'est dire la qualite du film."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Aristocracy, jewes, common people and the meaningless of wars. Great drama."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Greatest war film of all time?Could be.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,So good that I blatantly copied part of it for one of my 290s.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,So good that I blatantly copied part of it for one of my 290s.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A truly moving French classic about WW1. Performances are great, and the work of Renoir deserves 5 stars."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"One of the best ever, and best by renoir - and also amongst the best war movies ever."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Perhaps the best look at the insanity of World War I and the breakdown of European societies, from which they've arguably never really recovered."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,it's the best pacifist movie ever.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"GIRL IN WHITE: We saw ""Grand Illusion"" here last night.ALVY AND ANNIE (In unison) Oh, yeah?MAN ON THE SOFA (Looking over his shoulder at the group) That's a great film if you're high."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Perhaps the best anti-war film ever made.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"You have to see it for yourself to really understand why ""La Grande Illusion"" is pretty perfect as far as I can tell--to the point of feeling like it was made by someone magical or with a supernatural perspective."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,both Woody & I like this one
1.0,la_grande_illusion,easily one of the top 3 movies ever made
1.0,la_grande_illusion,the best anti-war film ever made!
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"un film de guerre humaniste, mais oui c'est possible."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,svartvit klassiker som handlar om grundläggande värderingar.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Prefect thoughout. Touching, deep, and full of social commentary. Both the cinematography and acting are ahead of thier time. I'm amazed that both Jean Gabin Erich von Stroheim were not awarded oscar nominations for thier performances."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the best film ever
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Le meilleur Film Anti-Guerre realise un peu avant la Deuxieme Guerre et tellement encore d'actualite! Une Grande lecon!
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"This is one of the best Anti war films I have ever seen. It describes the tragedy of the first world war so well, showing the changes to society that occur at that time perfectly."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,I watched it on TV in Japan. It was truely a piece of humanistic work.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Probably my favorite movie of all time, shot by the famous painter's son, beautiful depiction of gentlemanly peace in wartime. We're all just humans after all."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,A profound statement for peace. Starts as a prisoners-of-war picture but soon moves beyond genre and achieves... humanity.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Perhaps the finest WWI film ever. An anti-war film made at the brink of WWII.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,jean gabin is a sexy man
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Every good radical, socialist, idealist, anarchist, anti-nationalist, pacifist, humanist, and on and on should see this movie."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"In a cast of brilliant actors, I must single out Erich von Stroheim as the MOST brilliant! And that final scene, on skis. does NOT let you go!"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,My kind of war film.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A beautiful film in so many ways. Taken at face value, the film is entertaining as is. Delve below into the messages and implications of the story, though, and you'll find a bittersweetly intricate tale of human interaction and conflict and the strife that it so often carries."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A classic movie that defies easy classification. I would not call it simply ""anti-war""; war is mostly distant. Perhaps it is mostly about people in a situation that forces them the make ultimate choices of displaying what they are, or what they would like themselves to be."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,La Grande illusionUn classique magnifique et toujours d'actualité! Le combat des classes sociales! Tourné avant la 2ième guerre!!! ( 10/10 )
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Perhaps not Renoir's most radical film, but in my opinion his most moving, about the dislocations created by war and the at times futile struggles of men to stay somehow connected--to friends, to social classes, to lost conventions."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Lieutenant Rosenthal: Frontiers are an invention of men. Nature doesn't give a hoot.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,How can you make a war movie that's this witty and humane without trivializing its subject? Amazing. And the camera work is unrivaled (except by Bunuel).

1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Far too overshadowed by its near-contemporary Rules of the Game, I think it's a masterpiece. Gabin and von Stroheim are outstanding, and the relationship that develops between them really gives a glimpse of what could have been had not the catastrophe of the Great War intervened."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Movies don't get much better than this.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Hay que ver este filme. Muuuy bueno, entretenido e inteligente. Grandes actuaciones, excelente guion y puesta en escena."

1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the greatest prison escape movies of all time with so much energy and enthusiasm.

1.0,la_grande_illusion,"For all those who consider The Shawshank Redemption to be the greatest prison escape movie ever made, perhaps they need to take a look at Renoir's outing and reconsider."

1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A great political film. It's not just anti-war, it's also anti-jingoism. It's incredibly level-headed for an film produced by a French director on the eve of WWII."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Probably my favorite film by Jean Renoir - and that's saying something! A sophisticated reflection on class and civility during the Great War. Featuring some of the finest acting the camera ever captured, Renoir's Grand Illusion stands deservedly as one of the cinema's all time greats."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Certainly my favourite film. I prefer it to Rules of the Game. A most beautiful and humane film.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,An unmatched look at the farce of war and a clear proof that you don't need any bulletholes to make a war classic.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of those films that just makes you go 'whoa.' Needs to be seen on the big screen.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"One of the greatest french films ever made, and my personal favorite of renoir's. His humanism is strikingly apparent in this film. It is amazing."

1.0,la_grande_illusion,As close to perfection as any film ever made.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"You can't beat the work of the great Renoir. Plus Jean Gabin is very cool to watch. Despite being a war film, war is left off screen, leaving character development through dialog to bring the plot to fruition."

1.0,la_grande_illusion,A wonderful plea for peace made in the days before WWII.

1.0,la_grande_illusion,"The first prison escape film, and certainly the best."
1.0,1011813-lady_vanishes,Wonderfully stylish anti appeasement parable. The gung ho relationship between Lockwood and Redgrave develops seamlessly around and between Fascist foreigners who do not stick to the rules as the pompous barrister discovers.
1.0,1011813-lady_vanishes,"10 out of 10:Even if the plot takes a while to develop and the funny moments aren't always funny, that doesn't stop The Lady Vanishes from being thrilling, smart, and at times funny."

1.0,1011813-lady_vanishes,"A Hitch classic. I love the brisk and efficient plot here, which turns out to be much more believable than you might expect. And I love the two leads, Lockwood being a great brunette heroine and Redgrave a REALLY nice foil for her. One of my top films of all time."

1.0,1011813-lady_vanishes,"A fine ensemble cast, led by the dashing Michael Redgrave and the lovely Margaret Lockwood, give of their best in this rollickingly good film, definitely one of Hitch's finest."
1.0,1011813-lady_vanishes,"A simple pleasure of a movie; utterly fantastic, a film you could watch every day and never tire of.

1.0,1011813-lady_vanishes,"I sometimes wonder if this is my favourite film: I love the eerie atmosphere Hitchcock creates where all of the travelers seem suspect; they seem so evil when compared with Miss Froy's supposed motherliness. But also (pure girliness here), Micheal Redgrave's character is so sexy!"
1.0,1011813-lady_vanishes,"One of the most fascinating mysteries Hitchcock ever put on the screen, and also a powerful cautionary tale about the foolishness of trying to appease fascism. Michael Redgrave's performance is just about as charming as it gets, and a great cast supports him every step of the way."

1.0,1011813-lady_vanishes,funny and full of twists
1.0,1011813-lady_vanishes,"Still an absolute classic - if you can, you should rent the Criterion DVD and turn on the subtitles - the original sound is, admittedly, a little hard to understand at times but with subtitles you can read some of the *amazing* jokes."

1.0,1011813-lady_vanishes,"One of my favorite Hitchcock movies - it's a shame that most people aren't familiar with his British films. His American ones are also good, but his earlier work is more kinetic and has a vitality that he rarely surpassed once he moved to America."

1.0,rio_bravo,"If you only see one Western ever, you might want to make it this one. The actors are all superb and the story, while simple, is compelling. In so many ways this is the model for so many Westerns that came after it (together with films like High Noon)."

1.0,rio_bravo,This is one of my favorite westerns. Not only John Wayne and Dean Martin star in it but so dose Angie Dickinson. Its very similar to El Dardo thoe. But I gusse it was just so amazing the first time the had to make it agine.
1.0,rio_bravo,the cowboy flick to end all cowboy flicks.dean martin is drunk. john wayne is a stand up guy. ricky nelson sings. chyea.
0.0,rio_bravo,"John Wayne should've realized that when you make a film in response to another movie that the movie you're making has to be better than the film you're responding to. Horribly acted, horribly directed, horribly written. 1 star! High Noon is a masterpiece!!!"
1.0,rio_bravo,love this movie it is my husband fav movie it also grew on me
1.0,rio_bravo,"Rio Bravo is probably one of the best Westerns ever made. Wayne is so cool,but its Dean Martin as the drunk who shines for me."

1.0,rio_bravo,"What a cast, a great story and the songs are memorable...one of my top 10"
1.0,rio_bravo,"The most watchable Western of all time. A great buddy movie, a great shoot-em up, a great character study. Howard Hawks puts together the greatest Western/action team of all time with Wayne, Martin, Nelson, Dickinson, and Brennan."
1.0,rio_bravo,John Wayne underplays his character and lets Dean Martin take over in an often overlooked roll. The cast of characters are steadfast western favorites with just enough levity and seriousness to make this a fantastic move beginning to end.

1.0,rio_bravo,Every potential US immigrant should be forced to watch this western and then quizzed afterward
1.0,rio_bravo,"This is John Wayne's finest movie that has the Duk,e in his best role: a sheriff. The story is greatly told and fits the age rather well. Not many other Western films come close to this one's calm but dangerous nature"
1.0,rio_bravo,"A great story, especially when you realize it really is Dude's story, one of redemption...also great script. The new DVD, plus extras is excellant. Inspiration for the original Assault on Precint 13...by Carpenter."

1.0,rio_bravo,Y 'a rien de mieux au monde. Promis.
1.0,rio_bravo,"It's actually a romantic film about the way men should be, or want to be, and how they are as represented by the 3 characters. Or is it just cowboy gun-fights. I dunno. Brilliant. Chills up the spine when the mexican band start playing."
1.0,rio_bravo,I love this movie. Dean Martin was awesome. Angie Dickinson is fantastic. John Wayne thats really all you have to say.
1.0,rio_bravo,The first John Wayne flick I remember ever seeing. Still holds up 50 years later as a great film.
1.0,rio_bravo,One of the best westerns.
1.0,rio_bravo,"A perfect film. Hawks brings screwball comedy elements to the Western. Wayne is John Wayne, as usual. Dean Martin, though, is a drunk, and he's brilliant. I love this movie."
1.0,rio_bravo,"Classic Western. Has romance, comedy, music, drama and wonderful characters"
1.0,rio_bravo,"Gotta love Stumpy ""how was I to know it was Dude?"""

1.0,rio_bravo,John Wayne klassikko. Aivan legendaarinen.
1.0,rio_bravo,The greatest western of all time. This movie is funny but with a good plot and a solid performance by its cast. Stumpy is the best.

1.0,rio_bravo,the best john wayne movie ever - and thats saying something
1.0,rio_bravo,genius - the best movie ever made!
1.0,rio_bravo,"I've loved this movie ever since I was a kid. Stumpy is hilarious and I love how they have a scene in the middle of the film where the main plot essentialy spots and Ricky nelson, Dean Martin and Walter Brennan burst into song."
1.0,rio_bravo,"John Wayne was a great comedic actor, and Dino gives a fantastic performance. The anti-High Noon, it's a relaxed, long, light-hearted character-driven picture. See is just for the duet between Dino and Ricky Nelson."
1.0,rio_bravo,i really like this film.
1.0,rio_bravo,"""I guess we made him talk after all. """
1.0,rio_bravo,"This relaxed, character driven western may be Howard Hawk's most personal film. Much more about friendship and professional camaraderie than action or violence. Classic Hollywood filmmaking at it's best."
1.0,rio_bravo,I LOVE this movie!!!! My favorite part is when Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson sing.
1.0,rio_bravo,"I waver back and forth on which is better version of this tale (this one or ""El Dorado"") but since this one came first, it gets the slight nod."
1.0,rio_bravo,"Just an unapologetically fun western. Dean Martin really is outstanding as the recovering drunk, but everyone in the cast is terrific."
1.0,rio_bravo,absolutely flawless. The Dialogue is spot on. This one has it all!
1.0,rio_bravo,seen the movie 25 times since 1959
1.0,rio_bravo,Ahh gotta love John Wayne
1.0,rio_bravo,How can you not love a movie with a cast as great as that. One of the best all time westerns.
1.0,rio_bravo,"My Rifle, my Pony and me, nough said."
1.0,rio_bravo,"Dean Martin or Angie Dickinson? Who do I love more? It's a toss up. Don't even get me started on my main man Ricky Nelson, poor little fool."
1.0,rio_bravo,"Howard Hawks had a brain, and he wasn't afraid to use it. The entire case (almost) gives incredible performances, with Dean Martin and Angie Dickinson almost stealing the show from Wayne. It earns the definition of ""classic""."
1.0,rio_bravo,A true masterpiece. Walter Brenan is great. My favourite western.
1.0,rio_bravo,One of the greatest movies ever made. This is a standard for westerns.
1.0,rio_bravo,"Tässä on lähes kaikki: juoni, dialogi, pääosatähdet. Preeria ja musiikki. Jos tässä olisi aloitusbiisinä El Doradon tunnari, maailmassa ei tarvittaisi muita skoobarileffoja."
1.0,rio_bravo,Dean Martin and John Wayne playing the character they would play for the rest of their lives.
1.0,rio_bravo,"Wayne, Martin, Dickinson, and Ricky Nelson. It's like an animal burrowed into my brain with a video camera."

1.0,rio_bravo,love Angie Dickinson and Dean Martin
1.0,rio_bravo,"Ricky Nelson Was Hottttt. So was, in a way, Dean Martin"
1.0,rio_bravo,"In its simplicity it becomes one of the great westerns because it has a single vision, a particular point of view, and expresses it perfectly."
1.0,rio_bravo,this is like my favorite western ever!!!!!!!
1.0,rio_bravo,Uh who wouldn't love this movie.. Dean Martin and Ricky Nelson singing. That just warms a girl's heart. That and I absolutely love anything John Wayne plays in.
1.0,rio_bravo,A superbly-crafted western built on characters rather than action or landscapes. The Duke's presence leads the film but the rest of the cast are strong enough that he doesn't overshadow them.
1.0,rio_bravo,Envi d'etre enferme dans la meme prison que ces trois couillus.
1.0,rio_bravo,My favorite western movie by far.
1.0,rio_bravo,John Wayne-Another great movie!

1.0,rio_bravo,I REALLY LOVE THIS MOVIE!
1.0,rio_bravo,"A charming, funny, warm western, certainly John Wayne's best and a movie I've loved since childhood. While The Good, the Bad and the Ugly may define the genre as the western epic, this wins the heart."
1.0,rio_bravo,the duke is the foookin daddy
1.0,rio_bravo,The movie that inspired so many film makers. It is perfect. Walter Brennan portrays the best character that ever existed in any film....the one and only stumpy.
1.0,rio_bravo,seems better with each viewing. makes you see john wayne in a new way.you feel part of the action.very involving film.
1.0,rio_bravo,I've typed many different attempts at writing something for this movie. But nothing does it justice. This film is incredible.
1.0,rio_bravo,"The quintessential cowboy movie, I've seen a lot and they don't get any better than this. Even the 'lamest'(?)part of the movie where Ricky and Deano do a song is damn awesome. Walter Brennan, Johnny Wayne. Say NO MORE!!!"
1.0,rio_bravo,"Seriously everything about this film is perfect. Before, I had heard people call it slow-paced. What a load of bull! The time just floats by. Before, I thought John Ford was the master of the Wester, but after watching this I seriously needed to reconsider."
1.0,rio_bravo,excellent!!! i loved this one too!!!
1.0,rio_bravo,The same movie as Rio Lobo but a few different people. Still a good watch.
1.0,rio_bravo,My favorite western.
1.0,rio_bravo,My all time favorite movie.
1.0,rio_bravo,"Truly one of the great American films with one of the top American directors (Howard Hawks) and a cast of John Wayne, Dead Martin, Ricky Nelson and Angie Dickinson all hitting home runs in the acting department. A film to be viewed multiple times."
1.0,rio_bravo,Such crisp directing from Howard Hawks.
1.0,rio_bravo,"Triple attack of western hotties. This is like if Owen Wilson, Adrien Brody and Jason Schwartzman were all in a movie directed by an all star director...oh and if Schwartzman sang some songs."
1.0,rio_bravo,"A must see for anyone who thinks John Wayne sucks, as it will instantly prove them wrong. A brilliant chamber western with a fantastic cast. Outstanding."
1.0,rio_bravo,"i was a store and i saw the movie for sale, and iv never seen it before so i bought the 40 dollar set and i loved it"
1.0,rio_bravo,2 or 3 of john wayne!
1.0,rio_bravo,"I have seen Rio Bravo more often than any other film, and it never gets old. Hawks, Wayne and the rest are at the top of their game."
1.0,rio_bravo,"With the steely competence of his adventure films, and the usual upending of the same typical of his comedies, it might be Hawks' richest, most complete film. Certainly Wayne has never been better--and he's easily outdone by Martin and Dickinson."
1.0,rio_bravo,John Wanye and Dean Martin...Think thats says enough! I watched this with my grandad and is the total reason why I love it. [Apart from Wayne and Martin]
1.0,rio_bravo,The best western ever. Period. No discussion.
1.0,rio_bravo,A seriously funny (if that isn't a contradiction) and action packed addition to the filmography of the Duke.
1.0,rio_bravo,"One of the best Westerns known to man, i love this film"
1.0,rio_bravo,"My favorite western, I love this film, Dean Martin plays a superb role, showing that he relly was an all round entertainer, singer and actor!"

1.0,rio_bravo,This movie is pretty much perfect.
1.0,rio_bravo,I LOVE Dean Martin in this movie! Ricky Nelson is no slouch either. Just a fun movie to watch and enjoy with plenty of popcorn and maybe some beer or soda.
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,This is an unbearably tense and empathetic portrayal of psychotic breakdown.
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,A classic that was ahead of its time.
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"Brilliant. Every bit as good as ""Psycho."" Way more people should know about this dark gem."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"Ultimately, ""Peeping Tom"" is one of the creepiest thriller-horror films ever made."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"It was very controversial upon it's release, which is pretty strange when you realize it came out the same year as PSYCHO."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"Michael Powell's last film is essential cinema; the film's implication that the viewer, a voyeur just like Mark, is somehow complicit in his murderous deeds, riveted by his perverse atrocities and to some degree enabling them is profoundly fascinating and eerily disturbing at the same time."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"Peeping Tom is a disturbing, meticulous, voyeuristic examination of a serial killer."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"A very daring movie for its times, and with all the amazing and unique cinematography of the author."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"One of my favorite films of all time. Really creepy and disturbing and all can be attributed to atmosphere. Music, sets, performances are all incredible."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"""Peeping Tom"" is, without a doubt, one of the finest films of the 60's and 70's, as well as one of my personal favorites. Michael Powell's intense, crazy, and brilliantly horrific exploration of the mind of a serial killer hits all the marks and transcends some of Hitchcock's work."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,An underrated horror classic.
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"A masterpiece. Creepy and authentic... so realistic, you'll think you are watching a snuff film. Brilliantly depicted from the killer's point of view. Masterful camerawork and originality."

1.0,peeping_tom_1960,fantastic effort from michael powell. a new favorite.
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,It's as though Powell understood the deepest darkest charm of the movies and fulfilled the audience's most sadistic wish. The greatest film about voyeurism in history.
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"It's up there with Psycho - a classic among its genre. Strange, then, that Psycho helped Hitch's career, while this killed Powell's."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,Classic British creeper.
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,I's very hard for me to believe this psychological classic nearly destroy Michael Powell's career.
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,This is a deep and thoughtfully chilling masterpiece of horror that was way ahead of its time and remains one of the most influential films ever made.
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"Man, was that freaky."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,Way ahead of its time. Excellent film.
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"A masterpiece that can be read in multiple ways: the prelude of the slasher genre, a study in psychosis, the image as a weapon and even the demise of Powell's career. Rich and hipnotic, it is the definition of ""bravura filmmaking""."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"Why have I never seen this before?! Loved it. A villian you root for, the use of the camera as a weapon puts the viewer as the murderer. Can see why it was rather shocking for it's time."

1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"Clever, self-reflexive study of voyeurism, and the film-making process, with some very funny in-jokes that lighten the mood. One of the most unjustly vilified films ever."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,This is one of the best British films of the 1960s.Psychological horror at its finest.A rare treat....do not miss this one.
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"Made back in an era that didn't rely on a lot of gore and bloodshed to sell it, but it is still a really creepy, really bizarre, and amazingly well done film. It'd be mild by todays ultraviolent favorites but it is still a classic and a must see for any self respecting horror fan."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,I guess the title will turn off most people. But this movie is incredible. It's still amazes me that it was made in 1960.
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,It still is perverted and disturbing without actually showing flesh or blood. Brilliant.
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"No matter how many times I watch, I'm always watching with the lights on!!"
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,The only word that comes to mind is 'perfect.'
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"Clasico del suspenso britanico en la que un hijo de psicologo y fotografo de cine y pornografia (enfermito, enfermito, enfermito) decide asesinar mujeres y filmarlas en el momento de su muerte. Adelantada a su epoca."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,A brilliant precursor to Hitchcock's Psycho that IMO surpasses it in a couple of things
0.0,peeping_tom_1960,gerzek ingilizlerin boktan bir filmi.
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,The movie that ended the career of one of our most innovative film makers.Much too dark and complex for cine goers of the day and if it were'nt for Scorcese it might have been forgotten.A boy tortured by his Father grows to be a sick killer...the POV camera that closes in on it's unwitting victims.
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,Totally ahead of it's time. A classic.
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"In the end, when he falls in love but knows he can't puruse it because of what he's done and what he is."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,Totally ahead of it's time. A classic.
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"Wonderful leading performance by a stunning Boehm,manic-obsessive towards the female object.What's the catch here?It's simple.Powell orchestrates a parable of fiction over sexual problematic and comes off as a winner in the creeping race."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,Truly disturbing masterpiece.
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,Can't understand from 2008 how making a film like this could destroy the director's career
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,Creepy as can be. A great companion piece to Psycho due to both films being way ahead of their time. Need to see it again soon to get more out of it.
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,Far better than 'Psycho' this film set the standard for serial killer movies.This was banned for years and the lead actor Bohm couldnt get work for a long time after. Its a real classic and very disturbing :)
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"Why is it that our parent screw up any chance of a normal relationship? Why is it that relationships are so easy but we screw them up so horribly? Oh yeah, why does this nice young man keep killing women? All is revealed in this great movie."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"I think that this is essential viewing for any filmmaker wannabe. This eerie and effortlessly twisted tale of fetishism and murder reveals in at times frightening ways the true drive of (some) film directors. It's creepy as hell, but this is a masterpiece."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"Probably the only rival to Hitchcock's work. Paranoia, sexual deviance, the existential hero. This is the purpose that cinema now drifts without."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,i didn't give it my all but i appreciate it with all my past viewings and ones into the future.
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"Amazing film from Michael Powell that, unfortunately, ruined his career. Though dated, this masterpiece of atmosphere still captures your attention from the very first frame and doesn't let go. A perfect blend of satire, thriller and tragedy."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,Lacan would be proud.
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,One of the best psychological thrillers I have ever seen. On par with the best of Hitchcock.

1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"godard said that if you want to critique a film you should make a film. hence, this suspense/horror film which reads more like an essay on film spectatorship. you've heard of psychological horror, well this is psychoanalytic horror. big, brilliant lacanian fun for all. highly recommended."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"""Do you know what the most frightening thing in the world is? It's fear.""Masterpiece. In my top-5."

1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"A chilling, compelling psychological thriller."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,AN HOUR AND TWENTY SIX MINUTES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AWESOMENESS!!!!! XD
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"Not sure what is up with the '1999' release date - this is from 1960, I believe. I see some folks think it overrated. Well. I don't think it is for every taste. But if it doesn't make you think or argue with your fellow viewers ... well, I don't know what to say."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,It's an (almost) unknown classic.
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,This is an amazing movie. Powell goes over the deep end exploring the effects of manipulation and obsession.
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"Like Hitchcock, Powell directed long enough that the sadistic elements always latent in his work found their way to the surface. The result is disturbing. What an understatement."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"Powell's cursed masterpiece has stood the test of time, even better than it's excellent, better remembered contemporary, Psycho."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,groundbreaking cinema.

1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"Truly terrifying, this controversial thriller simply must be seen by everyone. It hasn't aged a bit."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"This may be one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. It's very witty, suspenseful, interesting, and Freudian. It is truly captivating."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"Forget Psycho, this is the real deal. Powell ruined his career with this scorchingly intensive portrayal of a sadistic and voyeristic killer but created one of the greatest movies of the 1960s."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,this is another masterpiece by Michael Powell. very creepy but i love films like these it doesn't go over the top and i felt sympathy for the main character. he always needs to bring his camera with him which i found funny but serious.
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,put this in context and your pants will fill with shit. hmm. us banned? i wonder.
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,This film is so rich in psychological and social relevance and discussion that one almost wants it to finish as soon as possible so cionversation can begin. An incredibly important film that deserves its place in the film canon.
0.0,peeping_tom_1960,"this film started really well, then it just went down hill from there, i found it hard not to fall asleep on the desk at school!!! it was dissapointing because i had such high hopes for this film. i'm only giving it one star for the beginning."

1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"This is my favorite Michael Powell film that I've seen so far. It's one of the more effective thrillers I've ever seen and despite not being a slasher film, features some of the more unique and intense deaths around."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"creepy, very creepy for in the year that it was made... originianally out of the early 60's.."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"Peeping Tom is practically a flawless thriller that is quite unsettling in more than a few instances. I loved the introduction, which sets up the film perfectly. The ending is very bizarre and powerful, mostly because I felt a strange degree of sympathy for the demented protagonist."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,This is comparable to Psycho. It is still more intense and frightening than everything out there (today).
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"It really is the British Psycho, but I would say even better."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,I'm guessing the date refers to the DVD release then... Amazing film nonetheless.

1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"There is really nothing like this movie. Disturbing, but very fascinating character study. Raises more questions than it has answers. Def. worth getting this finally out on DVD!"
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"The only word I have for this movie is ""amazing."" It's astonishing, both for its time (as much as I love Psycho, which came out around the same time, this movie's sophistication puts it ahead) and for moviemaking in general."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,So amazing. Especially to think that it was made in 1960.
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"A brilliant meditation on voyeurism, pointing a finger straight at it's own audience."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"Really creepy and psychological. I liked the style a lot. A very good complement to Psycho, and recommended to anyone who is a fan of that film."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,Serial murder has never been so beautiful.
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"This wasn't made in 1999, but rather in the 60s, but it's still an amazing film."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"Ahead of its time this film is still as affecting to watch, and Powell cameoing as Mark's father is a great moment."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"This is one of the best films ever made. In fact, I wrote an entire paper on Peeping Tom and psychoanalysis...but don't let that turn you off! It's somewhat ""Hitchcockian"" and definitely dark and disturbing. Not the usual fare from Michael Powell."
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,Im going to be brave and say it is better than Hitch's Psycho.
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,The date is wrong. It should be 1960.
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,maybe the best film about a serial killer ever made.
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,the ultimate in voyeurism
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,The weight of this film is still disturbing in 2006. I cannot even think of how it was recieved in '62. One of the finest films I have ever seen.
1.0,peeping_tom_1960,"A very creepy film about a man who watches and kills women he records on his camera. Also, the film that destroyed director Michael Powell's career."

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Outdoing the original, one of the best films I have ever seen"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"10 out of 10:The Bride of Frankenstein takes away a lot of terror, but replaces it with a lighthearted film that still has an eerie setting and great costuming."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,The Bride of Frankenstein has been deemed one of the greatest horror sequels as it improves a lot from the original from effects to character
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,A true Horror classic. Make a point to see it. Very scary.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Sad and frightening, Karloff's performance is unnerving in its deep longing for purpose and understanding in a world that hates him for simply existing."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Good Movie Good Classic
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,The greatest sequel of all time.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"This James Whale masterpiece just gets better with each viewing. Every facet of the movie, from script, direction, acting, score, cinematography, and production, is world class. Not to be missed."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,A monster and his beloved dead bride!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"One of those rare sequels that is actually worthy of its predecessor. Karloff returns as the monster, and Clive as Frankenstein. Karloff adds more personality to the Monster, while Clive reluctantly obliges his monster with a Bride. A fantastic, simple, yet original work of cinematic art."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"James Whale's Bride of Frankenstein is surely even more odd, over-the-top, visually exciting, and terrifying than its 1935 release, because we are more conscious of its undertones of macabre and violation."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"5/5 * Possible better than its predecessor, The Bride of Frankenstein advances upon its themes while being all the better frightening."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Campy and delightful, ""The Bride of Frankenstein"" introduces humanity (and possibly homosexuality?) to the previously evil monster to fantastic results."
0.0,bride_of_frankenstein,I don't care for this film.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"An absolute gem, possibly even better than its predecessor. A contender for the best Horror (or any) movie of all time."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"One of the greatest sequels ever. Not only does it manage to be as great as the original, but it just may be even better. Karloff is incredible."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,wow. so amazing. loved this classic

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Excellent performances.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Stunning! Boris Karloff returns to his role and this time he's at his best. everything about this film is memorable from Mary Shelley at the beginning to the bride of the monster at the end.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the few sequels that i loved more than the original.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Awesome in every way!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,The very best of the Universal Horror films.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"A wonderful, cinematic feat as beautiful in its visual presentation as it is in its touching tale of the human condition as represented by Dr. Frankenstein's repulsive monster, who has become more 'human' than in the first installment."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"With spectacular visuals, a great villain, and the monster being able to talk, Bride of Frankenstein is undeniably superior to the original."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Just one word CLASSIC
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the few sequels to really surpass the first film on all levels. James Whale's use of tracking shots and self parody are really ahead of its time which makes this film feel timeless in a sense.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,My third favorite film of all time. Everything about this movie is fantastic.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"This is the perfect example of a great film. The symbolism, Art Direction, acting, directing, and score is nothing short of pure perfection. This sequel is better than the original film. We really get to know the Monster better than ever."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,one of my favorite 'sequels' ever same director same cast and oh those silver streaks in elsa lanchester's hair.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"It's great! Although, it's more about Frankenstein than his bride; and it ends rather strangely."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Although not a horror film, this movie is one of the best films from the 30s. Holds up EXCEPTIONALLY well."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,seen it & own it! =0)
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"This movie is amazing. It combines comedy, parody, horror, and drama together in the right combination. The era when the movie came out helps a lot too. Multiple/mix genre like this wouldn't fly today."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Shows how man is the true monster.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,It really IS as good as they say.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,A sequel that surpasses the original. Boris Karloff was a woefully underrated actor. He gave the Frankenstein Monster such a gravitas thatno other actor who has essayed the role has ever come close to matching.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"A definite great movie. The only problem is that you only see The Bride for 2 minutes, then the movie ends... What?"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Alone: Bad. Friend: Good!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,For me better than the first.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"I LOVE the opening. What a way to allow for a sequel when the first seemed over and done with. A little more of a comedy, a little more of a horror, lots more energy and style than the first film. And what an ending! ""WE BELONG DEAD!"""
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,The absolute best film of its era and genre.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Probably the first sequel to be clearly better than the first.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"My favorite classic horror movie by far. Enough has been said about this movie over the years that I can't add anything more. If you haven't seen this, and you love classic cinema, this is a must see."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"I was no older than 10 when I saw this, and I had such a crush on Elsa Lanchester (I know, you don't have to say it)."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,your wife hates you get drunk with a blind guy!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,The monster smokes dope
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Its incredible how well James Whale's horror classic has aged. The greatest Frankenstein movie made is technically astonishing even to this day and Boris Karloff is both frightening and emotionally touching as Frankenstein's monster. Perhaps the greatest universal horror movies ever made.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,The best horror film ever made! Astonishing performances by Karloff and Clive! The reviving of the bride is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror films.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"This is a great sequel! I love that it, to me, has some comedic lines. Or maybe its just my brain because I LOVE Young Frankenstein? :)))"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,This movie does the impossible multiple times. It makes the monster into an endearing character. The movie makes you feel for the murdering mix of dead bodies. And most of all: it expands and exceeds the original. One of Universal's best!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,This was strangely magical and creepy with a heart hidden within itself.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"awsome, just awsomne!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"A true classic. Even better than the original. Ernst Thesiger practically steals the show with his flamboyant and macabre Dr. Pretorius. A must see, if not own, for any true horror fan."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Perfect! She's alive,she's alive...."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Alone, bad... Friend, good..."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the best Frankenstein movies ever.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"A Fantastic film. The Monster is more present in this film and is very enjoyable to watch. Boris will always be the best Frankenstein as far as I'm concerned. Elsa Lanchester is very Haunting and beautiful as the bride, yet her hissing is very eerie. If you love Horror movies this is a must see."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"I actually really liked it. The special effects were extremely impressive for 1936, Boris Karloff did an amazing job as The Monster, supporting actors and other roles were great actors,and the scene with the blind man for some reason really touched me. The whole friend idea I guess. I reccommend."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Really is one of the greatest movies of all time. Deserves to be among the ranks of Citizen Kane or Sunset Boulevard.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,nem folytatÃ¡s. ez a befejezÃ (C)s!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"""The Monster Demands a Mate"" Exceptional! Bravo! , Greatest of all Frankenstein film. It's rare for a film to have a sequel which is way better than the original one or had the same level of appreciation!. One of my favorites of all time!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One Of The Worlds Greatest Horror/Thriller Movies!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"fantastic film - possibly better than original, shows more brutality than the original and more character development. A superb masterpiece of early cinema"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Another one of those rare sequels that outshine their predecessors. Also directed by James Whale 'The Bride of Frankenstein' manages to delve deeper into the characters from the original film. Again Karloff gives his all as the Creature who longs for acceptance.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"About as brilliant as a sequel can get. Great story, interesting characters, beautiful music, and the performances by the actors are amazing. Bride of Frankenstein is a true cinematic Masterpiece."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"This is definately my favorite of the sereis. Clive and Karloff bothe give great preformances and makes you feel for the characters, even the monster. dr. Pretoreous is one of the best villains on screen and possibley the best mad doctor portrayed in a motion picture. check it out cause its epic."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"The best of the Universal monster movies. Bride is that rare sequel that, after viewing, feels like an essential companion to the original, the other half to complete the story. It's also truer to the book (a little), and just incredibly satisfying all around."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"The Bride of Frankenstein is just as great as the original, but this time around, we feel for the monster."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Personal favorite. I love this movie. ""To a new world of gods and monsters!"""
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"No doubt about this...one of the greatest masterpieces ever seen. If you haven't seen it yet, do whatever it takes to get a copy !!!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,I love this film so much!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Clive and Karloff continue to own their respective roles. This time Elsa Lanchester is along for the ride and adds something special. I'd actually argue that this is superior to the original Frankenstein.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"As classic as Whale's Frankenstien is, his sequel is even better. A true masterpiece and one of the crown jewels in the Universal classic monster series!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"just like its predecessor, classic"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Iâ(TM)d have to say all of the Universal Frankensteins held to a marvelously entertaining standard. Yes. Even âFrankenstein Meets Wolfman.â?  The humor James Whale injected into this one was quite a risk, but it came of beautifully, only increasing our sympathies for The Monster."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Yes. This is how you make a movie. Fantastic characters all around and insanely good lines.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Despite the fact that people will inevitably compare and contrast this with the original 1931 Frankstein, this is a different, pardon the pun, beast. Bride of Frankenstein is characterised by the camp and hammy performances of Ernst Thesiger and Una O'Connor and a sly, dark sense of humour."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Absolutely the best Frankenstein movie ever.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the very few sequels which improves on the first film. This is a blackly comic horror.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"This was the last of the great Universal horror films...after this, Universal took a downward trend into cheap camp, and the bright spots for the next 20 years were few and far in-between."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"More emotionally powerful than it has any right to be, ""Bride"" forever destroys the idea that a sequel is always inferior. Great emotion, iconic imagery, and even visual effects, are what make this widely considered one of the greatest thrillers ever put to film."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Director James Whale once again creates another great Frankenstein movie. As a sequel, the movie sticks a little more truthfully to the book and manages to give the monster a voice. A strange and at times funny film."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the best horror films ever made. A classic of the 1930s.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,30 Days of Horror Day 22:A sad horror movie.More on this come October 31st.

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,The rare sequel that outdoes the first film.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Lanchester was awesome and this movie was just great as well. This one was actually better than the first one which is saying something
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"It takes everything that works in the first Frankenstein and improves it. The shots are more iconic, the score is outstanding, the Monster learns to speak and the film mixes creepiness, pathos and still-impressive special effects into one incredible film. A visual masterpiece, regardless of genre."
0.0,bride_of_frankenstein,While i do love the old monster movies this is just not a good one. It was way too stupid. 16%
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"An absolute classic of a horror film. Karloff is fantastic, as are Dwight Frye and Ernest Thesiger. A shame The Bride isn't in it that much. Who knows what it would've been like then?"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,a highly entertaining film. a sequel which is better than the original. it had a bigger budget and it is obvious. sets are huge. there are more storylines. everything is much more complex. it is even funny at times. plus its tense and exciting. and beautifully filmed. classic.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Great sequel! It has all the elements that made Tim Burton, Tim Burton! Emo kids, Jack fans, all that gothic art direction, that surreal world and those dark and twisty were here first! Brilliant!"

0.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Another oldie crapfest.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Atmospheric, campy and just plain fun to watch. I love the whole 7 film Frankenstein series released by Universal in the 30's and 40's but this one is my favortite. This, the second in the series, was the last one directed by James Whale."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Some say this is better than the first one, it's definitely a close one. More science fiction is thrown in with the black magic dr. and his miniature people, it's kinda weird but that's the only part I have a problem with, everything else is great!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"One of the great horror films, is also a biting satire of love and acceptance. Lonely guy wants to meet a nice girl, he gets two doctors to create her and she rejects him. But that's how it goes in life. The ugly guy will always be rejected by the girl for the good looking doctor."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"The best Frankenstein movie and one of the true Hollywood classics! It's also the rare sequel that is as good as, if not better than, the original!"

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,the bride of frankenstein is my only weakness
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"The greatest sequal ever made. Far surpassing the original in it's scope, story, and ending. I love every frame of this film. A desire to have someone else so bad that you will do anything to get her, and realizing that it was not meant to be."

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Now this is a horror movie. Classic in every sense.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"One of my all-time favorite films, horror or otherwise.

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Better than FRANKENSTEIN on every level, Whale and Karloff seem to have grown into their roles with this franchise. Has yet to be surpassed (Fuck that DeNiro piece of crap)"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"I guess you could say this film is the Godfather Pt. 2 of horror. Its one of the very few horror sequels that manages to be better than the original. Don't get me wrong James Whale's Frankenstein is an absolute classic, but this one is better."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Oh please, if this isn't one of the greatest horror movies ever!"

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Dr. Pretorius is so much scarier than Karloff in this. We feel so much more sympathy for the monster in this one and there are some very clever special effects. The best Frankenstein film I've seen.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,This is a good movie
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"One of the first extremely subversive horror films. A true Masterpiece. James Whale is a genius, he made one of maybe two films that showcased the brilliance of Mary Shelly's book."

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Easily the best of the classic monster movies! This film took everything that worked in the first and built onto it a really moving and at times tear-jerking cinematic experience. This film is amoungst my top 10 favorite films of all time!

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Boris Karloff does it again with his great performance in this classic.

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"De toda una saga, de toda una epoca, la joya maxima de los estudios Universal."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"to the untrained eye this film simply reaffirms social norms and values, but it is subtly coded with subversive critiques of race, gender, and sexuality. i'm not saying the hollywood censorship codes were a good thing, but they certainly forced filmmakers to become much more clever."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"A very fun time. Some honestly wonderful special effects, too."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"An absolute classic! Really. To have created this film in 1931 is astounding. It's short and sharp, just like all those good, old films, and it's truly poignant at times. A must-see for lovers of b-grade horror and the like ;->"

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Brilliant. Dr. Frankenstein's trying to get out but Dr. Praetorious keeps dragging him back! btw, this is a tremendous step in the development of ""the sequel."" Whale and his cohorts were wise enough to grow the world, rather than remake the first picture..."

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,A masterpiece that amazes even today.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"James Whale's masterpiece genre film. This film is remarkable, not only because of it's stunning black and white cinematography, but also for it's heart, whimsy and influence. This is the film that Tim Burton aspires to make. It won't happen."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Oh, I love this movie. It's perfect."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,A rare case where the sequel is better. One of three classic Frankenstein tales.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"This is an absolute classic. Boris Karloff is one of my favorite actors, and this is one of his finest moments. If classic horror interests you at all--this movie IS classic horror."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Very rarely does a sequel supercede the life before it. This one does and in spades.  Oh, and Dr. Pretorius is a great character."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Elsa Lanchester is perfect as the bride. Her reaction to the monster, and his reaction to her, is tragic."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Un classique. Cette suite est encore mieux que le premier Ã©pisode (1931). Une somptueuse photo en noir et blanc, un monstre on ne peut plus convaincant et une histoire qui n'a pas pris une ride. Ã? voir."

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,better than the original. The human portrayal of the monster is my favorite aspect of this movie.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Even better than the original. James Whale's sequel is a great, great movie. The Bride is amazing of course, even though you see her only briefly, and there's a lot more humor than the first movie. Amazing movie."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Sometimes I have wondered whether life wouldn't be more amusing if we were all devils, and no nonsense about angels and being good."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Even though The Bride has very little camera time I find myself enchanted by the last few minutes of this film anyway. The rest of it is alright but the 5 stars go to the last few powerful minutes that Elsa shines in*
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Probably one of the first and best SEQUELS of all time. Great film.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Better than the first in my opinion. Sad as hell.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the few occassions that a sequel is better than the original. I also like how Whale took elements from Shelley's original work and inocrporated it into this film.

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Creepy and atmospheric, this movie is fantastically entertaining."

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Classic Universal Horror. This one is the best of the three Karloff films, which is saying a lot. There'e a bit of whimsey here, but it's dark, brooding and fun. The Bride is devastating and the monster SPEAKS!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"""Bride of Frankenstein"" was a terrific improvement over its predecessor. It added character, conflict, and a great score, and Whale made one of the best sequels in history."

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"I saw one scene: the final one. I take its memory out and fondle it every half moon. Knocked me on my ass. Beautiful. Walesevolved expressionism into the horror genre. I am a pedant, a monster far worse than Boris Karloff any day."

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the best movies ever made.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the few sequels ever to surpass it's original in everyway!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Arguably better than the original Frankenstein, The Mummy and Dracula, James Whale's second Frankenstein picture is a masterpiece of gothic horror. As re-animated babes go, Elsa Lanchester's ""Bride"" is hot as blazes. Too bad she didn't feel the same about Karloff's ""Monster"". A perfect film."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Tops the original in every way and may be the best damn horror film of all time. There's just so much entertainment value here, it's incredible."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,A brilliant sequel that doesn't take itself too seriously. Tim Burton owes a lot to this movie.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"The greatest of all of the Frankenstein films, and the greatest of all the Universal Monsters Collection! James Whale ?s direction is superb and is far ahead of any other film around that time, and Boris Karloff gives the performance of his life. Masterpiece!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Better than the first.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"One of, if not, THE best horror movie ever. One of the first to use humor in the story as well, if only they had kept the additional poltlines in, but this is where the monster really shines"

1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,Bogart never ceases to amaze me. This is arguably his best performance.What a ballsy script for 1948... or at least violent. And possibly one of the few films of the era without some sort of romance in it.

1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,I revisited this film recently. It's still one of the great adventure stories but at the same a fascinating morality play on the corrupting nature of greed.

1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,Humphrey Bogart's best film and a tale well worth telling. They just don't make 'em like they used to. This is probably the best movie that searches into the evolution of materialism and the downfall of the greedy.
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"Hard to classify adventure movie, one of Bogie's best performances. Great human drama that hits at the dark core of humanity in some chilling scenes. In its quiet way, the film builds slowly to a surprising and darkly ironic climax that is unforgettable."

1.0,his_girl_friday,"Grant at his charming, witty-bantered best."
1.0,his_girl_friday,This film made me a fan of Rosalind Russell. She is so funny in this film and works great alongside Cary Grant. Just thinking about this film makes me want to see it again
1.0,his_girl_friday,a fastpaced slick comedy! The Front Page and Switching Channels were remakes.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"I'm breathless; it's Hawks's best, Rosalind Russell is one of the great leading ladies, and Cary Grant plays one of the ultimate (awesome) slime-balls."
1.0,his_girl_friday,"This movie is obviously a classic for a reason. Super fast, awesome dialogue. I love Cary Grant!!"
1.0,his_girl_friday,"HI-larious! Cary Grant is amazing, charming and cocky all at the same time - he's obnoxious but you still cheer for him. They don't make them like this anymore - much to the detriment of modern movie-goers."
1.0,his_girl_friday,"I never tire of this film. They talk so fast and so wittily and never miss a beat. Cary Grant is phenomenally charming, as always, and Rosalind Russell is quite a match for him. The minor characters also add a lot to the comedic value of the film."
1.0,his_girl_friday,One of the best screw ball comedies I've ever seen.
1.0,his_girl_friday,Love it. Howard Hawks. Fast talking. Cool characters. Tons of in-jokes.

1.0,his_girl_friday,Holy hell does everyone talk crazy fast. It's a feat that someone wrote this and another that the actors took to it so well.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"pretty flawless, definitely i thought of it as a lesser 'mr. smith goes to washington'...i just didn't enjoy it quite as much, but rosalind russell is astoundingly good. absolutely a must-see...yay cliff edwards!"
1.0,his_girl_friday,The prototypical screwball comedy which set the standard for all to follow!
1.0,his_girl_friday,"This is literally my favorite movie ever. It's just perfect in every way (except for maybe the long portion in the middle of the film without Cary Grant, but... I quibble.)"
1.0,his_girl_friday,"They Do Not Write Movies Like This. Period. Russell and Grant crackle. If you haven't see it, you don't know what a movie can be."
0.0,his_girl_friday,"One of the best movies ever! Who couldn't love a Cary Grant flick? If I ever have another daughter, her name is going to be Hilde the film is so awsome!"
1.0,his_girl_friday,Everyone should see it once...though i have seen it multiple times
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Classic Howard Hawks film with Rosalind Russell and Cary Grant firing off their dialogue like machine patter. The script is witty, the plot immense, and the stars shine through it all. A real gem of the 1940s."
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Simply put; Grant, Russell, Lederer and Hawks all at the top of their game. Absolutely one of the greatest comedies ever made. Whip yerself like that monk from Da Vinci if you haven't seen it!"

1.0,his_girl_friday,I LOOOOVE THIS MOVIE!!! never ever has there been wittier dialogue! all hail cary grant and rosaling russel!!!
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Funny, quick and witty dialog, amazing acting and a great story. What's not to love about this movie. Russell and Grant are great together. And even Melvin Douglas is great as the poor, slow on the uptake gent that Russell thinks she wants to marry. They really don't make them like this anymore."
1.0,his_girl_friday,"One of the greatest movies ever. I'm pretty sure that if I had been born a lot earlier, Cary Grant and I could have had a thing...pretty sure."
1.0,his_girl_friday,"funny,fast...total entertainment...."

1.0,his_girl_friday,Smart and witty. What a great story. Well conceived and executed. A thinking film.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Premise: ""A newspaper editor uses every trick in the book to keep his ace reporter ex-wife from remarrying.""He taught me everything I know. The fastest comedy (the script) ever made."
0.0,his_girl_friday,was bored. cary grant made very few movies i actually like.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"The wittiest and fastest paced (dialogue wise) movie I've ever seen. Movies like this don't exist anymore sadly. Highly recommended, if only for Carey Grant's performance"
1.0,his_girl_friday,~~~CARY GRANT~~~  ~~THAT'S ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW!!~~~
1.0,his_girl_friday,The dialogue is second to none; Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell are impeccable - as are Ms Russell's hats
1.0,his_girl_friday,Excellent movie! Lines are all delivered with perfect timing. Rosalind Russell is superb and Cary Grant is pure magic!
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Superior cast, script, delivery, pace and idea from Howard Hawks. Highly recommended."
1.0,his_girl_friday,cary grant is simply amazing!
1.0,his_girl_friday,Classic film for all involved. The lightning speed witty banter reminds me how bland the dialogue is in most movies nowadays.
1.0,his_girl_friday,The dialog is the music.
1.0,his_girl_friday,Eden najboljsih filmov vseh casov!
1.0,his_girl_friday,2 years before Casablanca but twice the lines
1.0,his_girl_friday,Hilarious fast paced comedy. They just don't make movies like this anymore.
1.0,his_girl_friday,It's always bothered me that Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell didn't make any other movies together.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Classic! The dialogue, the acting...all while looking effortlessly gorgeous. The old cliche that ""they don't make 'em like they used to"" is SO true. The Grant/Russell chemistry is amazing."
1.0,his_girl_friday,Great movie with lightning speed dialogue.
1.0,his_girl_friday,la mayor burla al periodismo de la historia. los dialogos son mas rapidos q disparos de Tommy Gun! Es una de las mejores comedias q he visto (si no es la mejor). Creo q solo se le compara Dr. Strangelove...
1.0,his_girl_friday,Cary Grant. Rosalind Russell. Dialogue so fast it'll make your head spin. This movie is the gold standard for screwball romantic comedies.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"There is nothing I don't like about this movie. It's funny, exciting, topical, and even a little touching. Plus, the acting is unbeatable and the liberties taken with the original play really enhance the story and make it far more interesting."
1.0,his_girl_friday,cary grant is always awesome
1.0,his_girl_friday,The thing that really makes this film pop was the chemistry and competition between Grant and Russell. Much of the film is adlibbed and was encouraged by Hawks. The best scene is when they're in the bar sitting around the table...the entire scene was shot in one take and is 90% adlib. Brilliant!
1.0,his_girl_friday,Try to keep up with the dialog in this forerunner to today's romantic comedy! The pace is pitch-perfect and Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell are divine.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"You ain't sweet on this picture show? That's a lot of hooey. I'd put my arm in a fire for this movie, up to here!"

1.0,his_girl_friday,By far the funniest film from the Screwball era. Both Rosalind Russelland Cary Grant are mind blowingly funny.
1.0,his_girl_friday,The best film ever of a now extinct genre. Many have tried to revive the screwball comedy and all have failed. The perfect version of very good story.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"One of those great, razor-sharp comedies they just don't make anymore."
1.0,his_girl_friday,cary grant....howard hawks.....most badass rapid fire dialouge ever.....badass
1.0,his_girl_friday,"An witty, clever comedy that was entertaining from beginning to end."
1.0,his_girl_friday,"With characters moving at speed and brilliant dialogue being delivered at a machine gun rate, this is one of the great screwball comedies and a kick in the teeth for the many actresses such as Katharine Hepburn and Claudette Colbert who turned down the role of Hildy Johnson."
1.0,his_girl_friday,"A perfect comedy. Intelligent, cynical, rapid-fire dialogue, a uniformly excellent cast with the stars on top of their game. A stage adaptation that never feels stagey and that gives us a great battling love story to boot. Showing at the NFT as part of the Screwball Women season."
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Simple and charming. The wit crackles. Cary Grant is both debonair and absolutely hilarious, and Rosalind Russel is tough, brilliant, and vulnerable all at once."
1.0,his_girl_friday,This explains my love of newspeople. Cary Grant will be my love in heaven.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"clever, incredibly quick paced newspaper comedy about Grant trying to win back ex-wife."
1.0,his_girl_friday,Best screwball comedy ever. Grant and Russels dialogue is absolutely unbelievable it is so quick. Also Ralph Bellamy deserves a mention as the brilliant straight man to those two.
1.0,his_girl_friday,A Classic. Cary Grant is amazingly devious and Rosalind Russell is taking none of it.
1.0,his_girl_friday,really really great. witty and clever and fast. and the last half hour was so incredibly funny.

1.0,his_girl_friday,One of the funniest most genius films ever made in America. Cary Grant and Rosalin Russell are amazing.
1.0,his_girl_friday,You can take Hitler and stick him on the funny page... this movie rocks! And did I mention it was directed by Howard Hawks?
1.0,his_girl_friday,Perhaps the greatest American Comedy ever made. Certainly the fastest dialogue I have ever come across. Hawks' direction is just as poignant. A personal favorite.
1.0,his_girl_friday,A comedy that amazingly has 100% spectacular writing and acting! This movie is a blast to watch and has all the right elements to make it a late gem of the screwball comedy era.
1.0,his_girl_friday,The fast-talking movie to end all fast-talking movies. It changed the face of American comedy and holds up so well it could make a killing if released today.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Howard Hawks is a God. This movie is a train. It doesn't let anything stop it up. A woman jumps out of a window and in less than thirty seconds, it returns it's machine-gun pace and witty dialogue. ...why can't I be more like Cary Grant? ...oh yeah, I'm hideous and completely lack any charm."
1.0,his_girl_friday,The best of the best.
1.0,his_girl_friday,Possibly the FUNNIEST movie ever made. Fact! Sure is fast....
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Brilliant, hilarious movie."
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Some of the best ad-libbed dialog ever. Wonderful tempo, and Roz Russell is phenomenal (Cary Grant's not too shabby either)."
1.0,his_girl_friday,The first 40 minutes might be the best stuff Hawks and Grant have ever done.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"The fastest mouths in the West. Perhaps my favorite comedy ever. The script is perfect, as well as the direction and acting. It could not have been more perfectly cast. Brilliant and thoroughly engaging from start to finish."
1.0,his_girl_friday,"A snappy, riotous office farce, His Girl Friday is quite simply one of the best comedies ever made. Cary Grant is astonishingly good and Rosalind Russell is wonderful too. It doesn't get any better than this."
1.0,his_girl_friday,"If you think you talk fast, watch this movie and compare. I love this movie."
1.0,his_girl_friday,Progressive cinema in the sense that it portrays modern gender roles for both female reporters and actresses being able to keep up with the male counterparts. Also progressive in the delivery of lightning speed banter.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Best fast-talking, classic Cary Grant comedy. If you don't listen UP you'll miss half the jokes. Just classically perfect!"
1.0,his_girl_friday,Seriously one of the best movies ever made. Lois Lane's character was inspired by this movie.
1.0,his_girl_friday,Classic film with humor that holds out today.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Inventive and vexing, the former for the time, the latter because, well, then a war happened, leaving people like me sitting around holding their dorks wunnerin: where could we have gone from there?"
1.0,his_girl_friday,Nothing less than five stars explains it. A completely entertaining and engauging movie. Cary Grant steals the show as always.
1.0,his_girl_friday,Talk about fast deliveries! This insanely fast paced comedy raises the bar regarding witty scripts. Cary Grant and the beautiful Rosalind Russell. Delightful.  The grandady of Gilmore Girls (if that ever helps).
1.0,his_girl_friday,Wonderfully witty and fast-paced. Cary Grant is superb (as always) and Rosalind Russell is great as well. Great film!
1.0,his_girl_friday,Howard Hawks doing it the way he duz best. Cary Grant and Roselind russell sparkle.
1.0,his_girl_friday,You can't stop laughing!
1.0,his_girl_friday,Hawks' fast comedy is just about the sharpest film I've seen. Russell and Grant were fantastic. They were so full of energy that it could only be actors with their level of skill who could make their entertaining exchanges work.
1.0,his_girl_friday,Perfectly written and performed screwball comedy. The fastest movie ever made.
1.0,his_girl_friday,There might be two lines of dialog in the whole film that don't make me laugh.

1.0,his_girl_friday,One of the best examples of the fast talking sarcastic romantic comedies of the era. Holds up with the best of them.
1.0,his_girl_friday,Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell at their wise cracking fast talking best. Nearly 70 years after it was first released this is still hilarious.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Rosalind Russell set the bar very high for smart, sassy, fast talking broads. Truly a classic and worth seeing if you haven't."
1.0,his_girl_friday,Holy Shit! There's someone who talks more than AND faster than me!
1.0,his_girl_friday,One of my favorite Grant movies!
1.0,his_girl_friday,"smart, fast, funny. try to keep up with hildy and walter."
1.0,his_girl_friday,I have rented this many times because I thought this was a great Cary Grant movie.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Fabulously witty, Grant's most funniest performance in a lightning paced newspaper comedy. Features some of Grant's distinctive ad libs. When asked to describe his ex-wife's new fiancee, misplaces his line and instead comes up with ""Oh he looks like that film actor, Ralph Bellamy"". Classic."
1.0,his_girl_friday,fast-paced madness - Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell are fantastic. How can they talk that fast?
1.0,his_girl_friday,I think that I learned how to be a woman by watching old Rosalind Russell films. She rocks - always one scarcastic comment away from being a bitch but still so sweet!
1.0,his_girl_friday,this movie is pure fun especially if you catch the hidden jokes.
1.0,his_girl_friday,Grant and Russell are spectacular in this hit from 1940. The fast paced script and the obvious chemistry between Russell and Grant provides for a wonderful movie. A MUST for all Grant/Russell lovers!
1.0,his_girl_friday,A perfect example of it's kind. Fast witted dialogue that overlaps brilliantly just as it would do in real life. Grant & Russell have great chemistry and Hawks keeps things moving at such a pace you feel the tension build even though it is very much a comedy.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Cary Grant at his best, there really aren't movie star like him any more."
1.0,his_girl_friday,Brilliant all the way around.

1.0,his_girl_friday,i love cary grant! and fast-talking reporters!
1.0,his_girl_friday,The perfect screenplay. The dialogue has yet to be matched to this day.
1.0,his_girl_friday,Cary Grant was always at his best playing a smooth-talking rogue. This fast-paced intellectual comic masterpiece is one of his best. Rosalind Russell is his match (though much of her motivation seems sexist in this day and age).
0.0,his_girl_friday,"This movie fails to remind me that a woman only got one thing on her mind, and that is the reason for its low rating."
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Cary Grant and Howard Hawks, badass."
1.0,his_girl_friday,"""Hildy, don't be hasty! Remember my dimple!"""

1.0,his_girl_friday,Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell keep up their high speed banter through all of this great film. A real treat
1.0,his_girl_friday,"An unbelievably terrific movie - I could watch it over and over (in spite of some of Rosalind Russell's wacky outfits). Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell are spectacular, and Howard Hawks is a master."
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Classic movie, a must for any film buff. Grant is a master at comedy, and his delivery shines in this fast-paced movie about journalism and justice."
1.0,his_girl_friday,A comic masterpiece with writing and performances as tight as a two hour magic act.
1.0,nosferatu,This is one the scariest movie ever. IT has great acing. it also a great story line.
1.0,nosferatu,Classic Absolute without more.
1.0,nosferatu,Best 1st of the classic monsters even Coppola can't remake but he did a good job the original is far more creepy
1.0,nosferatu,"Horror movies ground zero, I know Caligari came first, but nothing beats an old horror character. One of the best silent movies I have ever seen, the film have an erie mood with a painting kind of impression, making the horror experience even better."
1.0,nosferatu,Great Movie. One of the best.
1.0,nosferatu,"A classic movie introducing many filming techniques used in horror to this day. This movie also has a swapped gender role story line, which is very far ahead of its time. All together, it is an important movie in its themes and its cinematography."
1.0,nosferatu,"A true gothic story, Nosferatu is full of eeriness and has a chilling performance from Max Shreck"
1.0,nosferatu,"10 out of 10:Nosferatu may be a silent film, but it still manages to be creepy with its great set design and makeup and a nice feel."
1.0,nosferatu,"i'm pretty sure the simply fact that a 16 year old boy in 2016 genuinely enjoys this film, i DEFINITELY a good sign"
1.0,nosferatu,"One of the best films of all time, it was a master piece shot in the style of German Expressionism. It utilised several techniques such as stop motion and foreshadowing. The story itself was a loose adaptation of Dracula though the creepy effect is still haunting even till today."
1.0,nosferatu,"It is incontestably a historical piece of cinema, the birth of the vampire in popular culture as well as a great example of the German Expressionist moviment. A classic of the classics. 5/5 stars"
1.0,nosferatu,"This timeless horror classic is scary, but enjoyable to watch and is better than lots of horror films today. I could watch this a thousand times and it would still be creepy. This masterpiece has great music, great actors, and it lives up to its eeriness to this day."
1.0,nosferatu,Went to see it with my boyfriend and they had a live band playing for the sound. It was amazing!
0.0,nosferatu,although I highly respect it as it's probably the first ever horror movie and it was extremely groundbreaking I personally found it quite boring and not enjoyable
1.0,nosferatu,"Nosferatu is a classic Horror-film, with iconic scenes and one of the best Horror-movie antagonists. Nosferatu is a great film with a good tragic ending, and deserves five stars."
1.0,nosferatu,"Classic horror, the first vampire film."
1.0,nosferatu,"One of the finest of the silent era, Nosferatu remains an influence to the horror genre thanks to its gritty feel and creepy performance by Max Schreck that still delivers some chills even after many years!!!"
1.0,nosferatu,"I used to be scared by his face as a kid. I grew out of that and now I realize that its a great movie and its legitimately creepy, especially for the time"
1.0,nosferatu,beats the hell out of alot of movies nowadays
1.0,nosferatu,Shrek's terrifying disposition as Nosferatu adds a whole new layer of horror. Murnau is in top form as always. The visuals and tight structure are to be revered and are frequently mimicked in modern horror with good reason.
1.0,nosferatu,Stephanie Meyer needs to watch this!!
1.0,nosferatu,"Amazingly eerie and frighteningly alive despite the limitations of this silent era of filming. I am a lover of all things horror, and this movie fit the bill very well. The creepiness of Nosferatu still works even in 2014, where there is a high standard for horror."
1.0,nosferatu,"90+ years old and still the best version of *coughs* Dracula to date - startling use of shadows and negative photography, and Max Shrek is still bloody terrifying!"
1.0,nosferatu,very cool to see something that old.
1.0,nosferatu,"Wonderfully acted and hauntingly shot, Murnau's horror epic still retains its power nearly 100 years (!) after it was made. Hilariously, considering the circumstances under which it was made, it also might be the best film adaption of ""Dracula"" to date."
1.0,nosferatu,"It's a classic, what's not to love."
1.0,nosferatu,"Schreck plays the eponymous vampire with an almost savage simplicity, and teamed with Murnau's striking and frightful visual storytelling created some of cinema's most lasting and haunting imagery. While not out and out terrifying, Nosferatu is eerily spooky and chilling."
1.0,nosferatu,One of the greatest horror films of all time.
1.0,nosferatu,I Loved It! I've always Wanted to see it and I Personally Love Max Shreck's Creepy Performance! Its Hard To Believe that He was one of those Actors that couldn't get out of character! Fantastic!
1.0,nosferatu,It's a classic for a reason.
1.0,nosferatu,"Eerie and macabre, this is the original vampire movie."
1.0,nosferatu,"It's impact is undeniable; ""Nosferatu"" is a silent-era classic."
1.0,nosferatu,"Nosferatu is a well made and best silent film I've ever seen. It's creepy, scary, and I enjoy it"
1.0,nosferatu,A great chiller classic and a good soundtrack i highly recommend you to watch this
1.0,nosferatu,Never thought a silent film could be scary...this is.
1.0,nosferatu,"Excellent, still scary after 91 years. Well worth watching to see where most later films in the genre got their ideas. Although clichéd now, this was the original and once you set the modern horror cliché aside, one can see the greatness in this film."
1.0,nosferatu,"A great silent classic, who put some extras to the legend of Dracula and vampires. Must see!"
1.0,nosferatu,"Creepy, beautiful and groundbreaking."
1.0,nosferatu,A true classic of the silent era
1.0,nosferatu,"It's the one that started it all. Five stars in the bank. Of course, I have to admit that this was just a bit more enjoyable watching in the context of John Malcovich's and Willem Dafoe's wonderful interpretation, ""Shadow of the Vampire""."
1.0,nosferatu,95% The makeup for Nosferatu is astounding for a film this old.
1.0,nosferatu,Bram Stoker's Dracula in a German silent film with Hans Erdmann doing the score is the ideal combination for instant horror success. Vampire culture meets the big screen for the first time in this historic gem. Look for this online as it will be hard to find.
1.0,nosferatu,"I think it's incredible how this film can truly scare without the use of any sound. The German Expressionist sets are great as well. The iconic use of shadow is great. This was the first silent film I ever saw, and it was an excellent experience."
0.0,nosferatu,"Nosferatu was creepy, but oh my god was it a boring movie. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was scary for it's time, but my was it boring."
1.0,nosferatu,This is the first silent film I've ever watched and it was amazing. A truly creepy rendition of the story of Dracula. If you can handle silent films I definitely recommend you check this out.
1.0,nosferatu,"Among the significant classics of silent cinema, Nosferatu sets the standard for modern horror films with its spooky, gothic atmosphere and a frightening performance Max Schreck."
1.0,nosferatu,"Scary and masterful, Nosferatu is probably the most influential Horror film ever made. This is the real first adaption of Bram Stroker's Dracula and is the best adaption too. Max Shrek makes a frightening performance as Count Orlock. Nosferatu is the best Horror film ever made."
1.0,nosferatu,"Dark, terrifying, and brillianly filmed"

1.0,roman_holiday,I just want to hug Audrey Hepburn whenever I see her. Even with the boy haircut. Gregory Peck was a douche bag in real life but I can get past it here. I don't even mind William Wyler direction. That's why the actress is more important than everything else.

1.0,some_like_it_hot,Watched this for the first time. Can see why it's a classic!
1.0,some_like_it_hot,"This should be 100%. Probably the best comedy on film. Just perfect. Curtis is amazing as is Lemmon... but the Curtiss ""impression"" of Cary Grant ranks as one one of the greatest movie takes of all time. Priceless. Immortal. Genius.My all-time favourite."
1.0,some_like_it_hot,"I have seen ""Some Like It Hot"" several times but never on a big screen with great sound. So thanks to The Zonita in Ampthill for showing this absolute classic the way it should be seen. I don't need to add much more except it is still very, very funny and brilliantly acted by everyone. Wonderful!"
1.0,some_like_it_hot,"""Nobody's perfect,"" Joe Brown says at the end. This classic comedy, however, very much is. The camera never swooned harder for Monroe than it did here. Curtis and Lemmon are equally sublime. An inspired romp of knowing cynicism, quirky comedy, and tender romance. Wilder just does no wrong."

1.0,400_blows,"A very beautiful, heart-wrenching and honest story about the weaknesses of the society and with no doubt a timeless masterpiece. The mettre-en-scene is spectacular, the acting is flawless. Everything about this movie still seems so fresh and original."
1.0,400_blows,I caught this film on TV about 10 minutes into it and was instantly taken in by it. The direction is beautifully simple and the story perfectly told.

1.0,400_blows,A brilliant masterwork of enormous cinematic beauty--Francois Truffaut's best film by far.

1.0,400_blows,"Impressing story! Doinel is an intersting character,he goes agianst the rules and it's this that I like in him."
1.0,400_blows,"One of the most ""Ahead-of-It's-Time"" films I've ever seen. Astonishing to watch considering what was being played in America at the time and proof that the French basically invented modern filmmaking during their New Wave period."
1.0,400_blows,A masterpiece in storytelling
1.0,400_blows,"Absolutely love Truffaut. Just made the best coming of age story. Tortured at home, can't make it on the streets, screwed over by friends, not to mention going to a Boy's Only Reform Camp. Just what 1959 was all about. Loved every second."
1.0,400_blows,"Truffaut's classic black comedy is a masterpiece that compares to no others; Francois's camera work is subtle, but unrestrained."
1.0,400_blows,"Truffaut's timeless masterpiece still holds up today on emotional, philosophical, and technical levels. The cinematography is as stunning as ever, with several images that will linger in your mind for a long time, crafting an inspiring and moving coming of age tale."
1.0,400_blows,One of my all time favorites. Very groundbreaking in so many ways and such a great film. Really a clinic on film in general.
1.0,400_blows,I peed my pants crying at the end.
1.0,400_blows,"I know this is late (or should i say really late), but i want to say that this is simply one of the best film ever made, and it also contains the finest child performance ever captured by camera."
1.0,400_blows,4/4--This film is so brilliant that I don't consider it a movie. Its a piece of the human soul that everyone can relate to.
1.0,400_blows,Truffaut is an all out genius. An incredibly heartfelt and relatable French New Wave masterpiece.
1.0,400_blows,"Part a homage to childhood (similar to Amarcord) and part a critique of French society, this masterpiece chronicles the gradual descent into delinquency of a normal, bright boy."
1.0,400_blows,One of the best final shots of ever.

1.0,400_blows,Truffaut's masterpiece. Personal and simple story...
1.0,400_blows,Sincerity and Validity.
1.0,400_blows,This movie broke my heart!Funny that this one is so sad and intense and the others are comedies.
1.0,400_blows,"The first time I saw this it was in a double bill with Jules and Jim.I like Jules and Jim, but this film affected me on a personal level. I completely related to the character of Antoine Doinel. One of Truffaut's best."
1.0,400_blows,poignant.very very poignant..probably the closest CATCHER IN THE RYE adaptation i could get...
1.0,400_blows,This is one of those movies that just makes you go wow. I was enthralled the whole time and was completely invested in all of the characters. I am very excited to see more of Francois Truffaut's films because quite frankly this movie was amazing.
1.0,400_blows,I know how he feels.
1.0,400_blows,Francois Truffaut...
1.0,400_blows,Fantastic example of awesome cinema. The film is now iconic. I loved the realism of the characters and the places and spaces they inhabited.
1.0,400_blows,They sure don't make them like this anymore.
1.0,400_blows,"Probably the best performance by a kid i've seen in a movie. Leaud is so good, he shows the character's confusion and angst so well. And Truffaut makes the character believable and easy to relate to. The last shot is something that will stay with you and haunt your dreams."
1.0,400_blows,"Review in haiku:French New Wave classic.And today, folks watch Paul Blart.An honest, strong film."
1.0,400_blows,"So sad and so true. This is an honest picture, it shows all sides good and bad. And because it is so fair and so close to home, it's heartbreaking on a very deep and personal level. Anyone who's ever felt alienated by friends and family will understand this movie."
1.0,400_blows,"The French New Wave's crowning glory, this film is one of thee greatest films ever made; I mean that, Truffaut, shows the un-clenching view of society."
1.0,400_blows,Beautiful. I really enjoyed it.
1.0,400_blows,This movie is for pussies.
1.0,400_blows,I really love the few French New Wave films I've watched because they've got the quality of art from the 1920s-30's - it's fresh and iconoclastic -- driven by the pretension of youth. Les 400 Coups is to the New Wave as The Fountain is to Dada.
1.0,400_blows,"Awesome, awesome movie! Love it!"
1.0,400_blows,Wow this is such a great movie.  This is the best forgein film ever
1.0,400_blows,I've seen all the Antoine Doinel films. This one is definitely the best. Love that freeze-frame at the end.
1.0,400_blows,"saw it again this weekends.still felt touched so much by the ending long take.  ""you asked me where I was going.I pointed at the sea"" lyrics of a song being once popular here"
1.0,400_blows,"The 400 blows reminded me once again what it's like to be 13.  Francois Truffaut's first feauture film is not only a staple of French new wave, but also one of the best films ever on adolesence. What beautiful black and white photography!  Masterpiece."
1.0,400_blows,Essential French New Wave - a must see.
1.0,400_blows,A touch arty? Yes. Brilliant.
1.0,400_blows,Cuando el cine francés parecía estar sumido en una crisis temática surge Los 400 golpes de Truffaut. Acertado guión y precisa visión de cómo un niño puede convertirse en criminal. Muy recomendable. Cine de autor 100% puro.
1.0,400_blows,Francois Truffaut's first feature is an haunting and painfully accurate look at adolescence.
1.0,400_blows,"La ""nueva ola"" francesa trajo consigo una revolución en la industria y esta obra maestra de Truffaut. Nuevos objetivos y movimientos de cámara. Cómo olvidar el Travelling en el mar."
1.0,400_blows,Mon premier Truffaut vu et pendant longtemps mon prÃ©fÃ©rÃ©.

1.0,400_blows,"What do you say about a favourite? 'The 400 Blows' makes me want to run through the streets of Paris, and escape to the seaside. I too was young once."
1.0,400_blows,One of the greatest ending scenes of any film. Antoine Doinel is one of the best protagonists of all time. A must-see.
1.0,400_blows,"initially i didn't know what to think of the unusual style of the movie, but careful afterthought made me realize how well done this movie is. definitely worth watching."
1.0,400_blows,it doesn't get more classic than this... powerful french new wave at it's best. stunning black and white with ending to make even a black heart tear.
1.0,400_blows,"very good. even though i still prefer Hiroshima Mon Amour as one of the French Wave firestarters, 400 Blows was still marvelous... and yea, like some say, the last scene was quite something."
1.0,400_blows,Magnifique! Poucos filmes sao tao sinceros.

1.0,400_blows,A magnificent movie by Francois Truffaut.
1.0,400_blows,"One of the very few PERFECT films ever made. Just like Forbidden Games, this film concerns the death of innocence, but The 400 Blows is the seminal film on the subject. One of the top 10 greatest films ever made."
1.0,400_blows,classic piece of french cinema from francois truffaut.
1.0,400_blows,"I don't think Truffaut ever surpassed this one. He came close, but for me the lingering, nostalgic naturalism and sense of childhood's finite nature make this one impossible not to love on a very simple level."
1.0,400_blows,A Forever Young Film. Will never feel old.
1.0,400_blows,Beautiful cinematography and a well made feeling of depression and misunderstanding in this film.
1.0,400_blows,"It's very good. My wisdom teeth came out yesterday and I don't feel like being intellectual, so I won't. It's very good."
1.0,400_blows,Beautiful and touching movie about a boy who can't find the meaning of life when you're not a kid anymore and you're becoming a man. One of the most powerful ending sequences in the history of cinema.
1.0,400_blows,"B&W;, performance, Montmartre....and so Doinel starts.."
1.0,400_blows,really damn good. hard to believe it was made in the 50s. everything was just so much better than american films at that time.
1.0,400_blows,Paris never look so good
1.0,400_blows,A fantastic display of the juxtaposition between unassuming adolescence and conservative adulthood. Leaud is absolutely amazing!
1.0,400_blows,"amazing. The whole series is good, but this of course is so true, so beautiful and so sad."
1.0,400_blows,"Pour le dernier plan de Jean-Pierre Leo, son regard saisi par Truffaut : libre et blessÃ© Ã  la fois."
1.0,400_blows,duh...classic. wanna know how anti-authoritarians become that way?

1.0,400_blows,"Doesn't lose any emotional power of the years, a masterful debut for Truffaut!"
1.0,400_blows,I extremely remember my childhood when i saw this movie.
1.0,400_blows,French New Wave at its best.
0.0,400_blows,"Ok, it's considered as the origin of the ""Nouvelle Vague"", the main character is Truffault's alter-ego and it was made in the fifties. Although it seemed pointless to me."
1.0,400_blows,Every man who ever and a childhood needs to see this movie.
1.0,400_blows,A fundamental classic for anyone who loves film.
1.0,400_blows,Antoine Doinel's final run to the sea touchs me every time
1.0,400_blows,Fantastic...one of the best foreign films I've seen in a while.
1.0,400_blows,"Superb acting to complement a powerful story. The film makes a clear suggestion that messed up adults create messed up kids. On the flip side, kids can be quite resilient in trying to find ways to survive the mixed messages of the adult world around them."
1.0,400_blows,The only film from the French New Wave I can re-watch. This film affected me the way Catcher in the Rye did for many other folks.
1.0,400_blows,The film that woke me up to cinema when I was a teenage.Thanks PBS!
1.0,400_blows,This is a timeless classic - a beautiful beautiful story of a mischievous young boy deserted by the world (save perhaps his lone friend) who looks for an escape and finds none - the tracking shot followed by the sea and that freeze... unbelievable.
1.0,400_blows,Truffaut lets it all out here. Go Nouvelle Vague

1.0,400_blows,The final scene on the beach is one of the most hearthrobbing and hopeful little piece of art in the whole history of cinema.
1.0,400_blows,"I'm going to avoid name dropping things like ""French new wave"" and such and describe the film as some said it to me.""It's like Degrassi Junior High if Degrassi Junior High was awesome and French and had better music.""I'm inclined to agree."
1.0,400_blows,"La historia es hermosa, la fotorafia de la pelicula igual, me encanta... el final es fasinante... Tru ffaut un gran maestro...!!!!"
1.0,400_blows,My 5th favorite of all time. A beautiful film about a boy pretty much neglected by adults around him. Sounds like my childhood. The ending is one of the most moving I've ever seen.

1.0,french_connection,"A crime thriller that shoulds be one of the best of all times. Gene Hackman as ""Popeye"" Doyle a non brilliant cop but a obssesive and stubborn one to get what his intuition says. A fabulous chase scene with Doyle in a car running behind the metro train."

1.0,french_connection,"A tense, thrilling, powerful and fast paced thriller, The French Connection is easily one of the best thrillers around and its helped because of its outstanding performances and impeccable direction."
1.0,french_connection,A masterpiece from Friedkin. Popeye Doyle is probably my all time favourite cops. Hackman is on fire and that fricking car chase. A wonerful tale of cat and mouse.

1.0,french_connection,Popeye Doyle will remain one of the most baddest asses of policemen ever.
1.0,french_connection,"The most realistic cop movie ever. It is slow at times, but that is because it recreates the pace of a cop's job. Gene Hackman's best performance and an strong sense of time and place more than makes up for it."
1.0,french_connection,"Trazendo uma Ã³tima atuaÃ§Ã£o de Gene Hackman e uma fantÃ¡stica direÃ§Ã£o de William Friedkin, ""OperaÃ§Ã£o FranÃ§a"" Ã (C) um dos melhores filmes policiais jÃ¡ feitos."

1.0,french_connection,"One of the best cop movies ever made, and the greatest chase scene ever filmed."
1.0,french_connection,Classic 70s crime-drama. It has one of the more memorable chase scenes and superb performers from Hackman and Scheider.
1.0,french_connection,this film includes the most brilliant car chase scene and the ending i've ever watched ....
1.0,french_connection,"It was said the movie had the first ever high profile speed chase and, it was indeed !Magnificent cinematography and it was in 1970â(TM)s filming with that technology."
1.0,french_connection,"Well, this ""dirty cop"" drama is quite odd, but of course as humorous, expertly well-acted, and action-wise the most thrilling of all-time. A 1971 Pontiac LeMans vs. an elevated train (with a fleeing hitman onboard) is what makes this film famous."
1.0,french_connection,"The original gritty, urban cop movie. Gene Hackman proves you don't have to be pretty when you know how to kick ass."
1.0,french_connection,"Slick, well-plotted, and with a terrific cast. Hackman never fails to deliver, and Scheider is great as well. This is a phenomenal movie, and a defining film of its generation. The critic that gave this a rotten should be tarred and feathered."
1.0,french_connection,Classic 70s action thriller

1.0,french_connection,"Great movie, fantastic car chase. Can't beat 70's cinema."
1.0,french_connection,"A movie that goes far beyond a memorable car chase scene, The French Connection maintains full force to date by the raw picture of urban decay, and above all by the coldly pessimistic ending, possible reflections of the North American political scene of then."

1.0,french_connection,One of the best Gene Hackmen Movies you will ever see!
1.0,french_connection,"Best Cop movie ever. Best Car Chase in a movie ever, Bullitt sucks. Popeye rocks!"
1.0,french_connection,Ambiguity is what elevates this film above typical cop/action genre. The moral uncertainty encountered throughout the movie perfectly characterizes New York City in the 1970s- not a happy place to be. Futility is the name of the game.
0.0,french_connection,"yes the car-subway train car chase was pretty awesome in this, but the rest of this was dull as hell."
1.0,french_connection,Awesome. One of the best chase scenes.

1.0,french_connection,Perfectly encapulates how brilliant 1970s american cinema was
1.0,french_connection,"Along with Bullitt and Dirty Harry, this is one of the best of those gritty action movies that came out in the late 60s/early70s. Hackman's ""Popeye"" Doyle is blundering and borderline incompetent - ultimately more human than most movie cops, if not more sympathetic. Check out the sequel as well."

1.0,french_connection,"This is a fucking sirloin steak and baked potato of a movie. Filling as hell. That car chase is peerless, and the movie looks like it was filmed, then pulled from the camera to put on a reel. This is potent movie. And to paraphrase Dave, ""Amawesafuckingmazing""."

1.0,french_connection,Among my all time favorites. I don't know why.

1.0,french_connection,Hackman is in his element here. The photography makes New York look grimy as hell. ANd the car chase is that good.

0.0,last_picture_show,"Typical McMurtry prententious dribble. It seems as if he wanted to write a dirty story and decided to have it take place in a small Texas town, just to make it provocative - a story without a story that exists only to exist. Not nearly worth the hype."

1.0,last_picture_show,"Ignore the upbeat music in the trailer shown here and replace it with classic Hank Williams as used throughout the movie. Some of the best acting on film from Cloris Leachman, Ellen Burstyn and Ben Johnson. Brilliant adaptation of the McMurtry novel."
1.0,last_picture_show,This could easily be titled No Country for Young Men and sum up the story perfectly. The characters have literally no hope for a happy life in this town and it is simply fascinating to watch that reality crumble in to place for them. Beyond that the cast is phenomenal.

1.0,last_picture_show,"The Last Picture Show is basically a Norman Rockwell painting of a Shakespearean tragedy with the word ""smoldering"" placed somewhere in there. If you can't relate to this movie in some way, if some part of it doesn't reflect some aspect of your life, you are probably not human."
1.0,last_picture_show,"An exciting piece of 70's cinema. Despite taking place in the 1950's this film feels timeless. The relationships are raw, sexy, frustrating, and human. Mistakes are made, lovers become entangled with other lovers. What a beautiful web that Bogdanovich weaves."

1.0,last_picture_show,One of the best American films of the 70's.
1.0,last_picture_show,"Great acting (especially by Bridges). Black and white at first seems a little strange, but fits the movie perfectly, reflecting the desolate, almost ghost town they live in. The ending takes a while to understand the meaning of, but it still ranks as one of the best movies I've ever seen."
1.0,last_picture_show,I love how they gave it the 1950s feel.
1.0,last_picture_show,A extremely potent film about the ending of adolesence and the difficulties that go along with it. This film touched me like no other film has touched me. I love this film. Could there have been a more wonderful last picture show than Red River? Bogdanovich is brilliant.

1.0,last_picture_show,One of the great films of all time--a bleak and sad loss-of-innocence story with rich characters and great acting. Wonderfully dreary b&w; photography. Why did director Bogdanovich's career collapse??
1.0,last_picture_show,Absolutely amazing and memorable. Bottoms nails what I believe is a very hard role. The film makes you justify grey subject matter in black-and-white. It's an homage to other movies which never could have shown what this movie does.

1.0,last_picture_show,The best character movie I've seen. Reminds me a lot of American Beauty.
1.0,last_picture_show,A stark black-and-white drama about a fading small texas town in the 1950s....Perhaps director Peter Bogdanovich's finest hour second only to the more sugar coated Paper Moon. The most mournful of all youth films.
1.0,last_picture_show,"This move is a school in honest filmmaking. It's slow pace help construct a world so real, so engaging that I couldn't stop watching."

1.0,1017289-rear_window,Hitchcock challenges us to morally relate our film going experience as an act of voyeurism itself as we pass judgement on the faults of all the main characters of this film only to realize that all these elements can be found within all of us. Masterful.

1.0,1017289-rear_window,"Rear Window may be even more relevant now than it was the year it was released. Just like the members of Jimmy Stewart's courtyard, we have willingly given up our sense of privacy and picked up an unsettling propensity of monitoring those around us."

1.0,throne_of_blood,this is THE in in only Macbeth Film you habe to watch....
1.0,throne_of_blood,a truly masterful retelling of macbeth.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Brilliant in every way
1.0,throne_of_blood,Throne of Blood is my very own introduction to Shakespeare though not the first. The combination of Kurosawa and Mifune is simply unbeatable!
1.0,throne_of_blood,When my literature class of emo-flunkies rates this B&W; 1957 Shakespeare film over Branagh and Gibson...you know something's special about it. Kurosawa was never better and Shakespeare was never dignified as much on screen. Sorry Ken & Larry!
1.0,throne_of_blood,Pretty much perfect.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Haunting in the most visually appealing ways with impressive illusive effects seen in Kurosawa's films. Throne of Blood is very dark and spiritual with a great stage play brought to life. Also, and again, Mifune delivers."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"One of the most fresh, intelligent, visually-effective and purely magnificent takes on the old Shakespeare tale of deceit, greed, and bloodthirsty desires. Mifune and Yamada perform in the most striking and memorable way."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"The first time I saw it, at the end--when a certain forest literally started moving--I thought that Mr. Kurosawa had gone and changed the ending to the bard's play."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa is regarded as one of the great filmmakers of all time, and it's easy to see why. This is a majestic, enthralling film that reinterprets Shakespeare's Macbeth as a bold and truly epic Samurai picture. Hands down a contender for the best adaptation of the Bard ever put to film."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Best Macbeth adaptation ever. Should be a classic on everyone's shelf
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa's samurai retelling of Macbeth is brilliantly evocative and legend has it Mifune seriously risked his life making the ending. Repeated viewings make his villainous character appear more sympathetic.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Mifune again is superb as in Seven Samurai. This time the tradgedy of Macbeth translated into the Japanese medium and it is superbly handled. The ending is incredible and the film haunting from start to finish, Kurosawa's vision is beautiful, haunting and epic."
1.0,throne_of_blood,An amazing adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth. Set in feudal Japan with Kurosawa regular Toshiro Mifune masterly taking the lead role accompanied by by equally stunning screen performance by Isuzu Yamada as his wife. The ending has to be seen to be believed and has not been bettered to this day.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa's version of Macbeth---a feast for the eye--wonderful, a perfect movie, and true to the feeling of the original Shakespeare play"
1.0,throne_of_blood,A magnificent adapttion of the Shakespeare`s play!
1.0,throne_of_blood,It´s a must see! It´s shows how silence sometimes speaks louder than any word!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"The best version of any Shakespearian play on film, despite it being Macbeth transplanted to feudal Japan. Amazing in every respect!"
1.0,throne_of_blood,Amazing adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth. Probably a more Shakespearean film than nearly all the traditional movies of the bard's works. Must see.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Along with Seven Samurai, Kurosawa's best."
1.0,throne_of_blood,My only exposure to Shakespeare is through Kurosawa...
1.0,throne_of_blood,THRONE OF BLOOD (1957)

0.0,throne_of_blood,I cared about Macbeth as a tragic figure. Washizu can suck arrow.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A Japanese classic, Kurosawa's adaptation of Macbeth."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"One of the very best Shakespeare adaptations. Akira Kurosawa not only retells the story to perfection but he also blends the themes of the original with his own themes and Japanese history, just as well as he did with his much later film Ran."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"The Shakespearean influence is obviously there, not only in story, but the film itself has a very theatre-esque feeling to it. The ending was fantastic. One of Kurosawa's best films."
1.0,throne_of_blood,A fantastic film adaptation of MacBeth's play in which fog and tangled forest webs emphasize the limits on man's foresight.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Macbeth set in feudal Japan, just brilliant. Mifune, as ever and I loved Isuzu Yamada as Lady Macbeth, still and emotionless steadily egging him on to his doom."
1.0,throne_of_blood,A brilliant adaptation on an epic scale.
1.0,throne_of_blood,The best film adaptation of Shakespeare ever. Incredible film.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"If theres a better film adaptation from a shakespear play (maybe Ran, but its a close call) than throne of bllod, I'd love to see it. Throne of blood is creepy, stunning, and masterfully made. Theres alot of depth behind the main characters, and its not just another re-telling of a shakespear play."
1.0,throne_of_blood,A great adaptation by Kurosawa of MacBeth. This movie will stand alone from other Kurosawa films because it is a different kind of story(with the exception of Ran)from the gunslinger fashioned ronin samurai.
1.0,throne_of_blood,A great adaptation of a great Shakespearian play. Stunning cinematography and acting. Very true to the play with only one significant change in the ending. But the change is (dare I say) better than the original. Recommended for anyone who likes Shakespeare.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Brilliant! Kurosawa's version of Macbeth in a samurai style.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Toshiro Mifune, Isuzu Yamada, Takashi Shimura, and Minoru Chiaki star in one of the many highlights of Akira Kurosawa's career."

0.0,throne_of_blood,"As much as I normally love Kurasowa, I just couldn't get through this. Maybe someday I'll give it another chance."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Arguably the finest cinematic adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth and one of Kurosawa's best films.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Better than Shakespeare!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa's best ever ! He highlighted perfectly the mystical dimension of Macbeth.Toshiro Mifune is amazing : a warlord returning from the battlefield to his homeland, fighting against his destiny ; against himself and his own craziness...Untill the end, which is totally apocalyptical."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"You put Toshiro Mifune, Akira Kurosawa, and a Shakespeare story together in a room and it's going to take a lot for it not to be fantastic."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Can Macbeth get any better than this? Loved the scene with the moving forest. Wow.
1.0,throne_of_blood,I love this film!!! There has never been a greater actor than Mifune Toshiro. Shakespeare should be proud.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A bona-fide Kurosawa masterpiece. Epic in its scope, its themes, its origins in Shakespeare and Noh theatre, and its lead performance by the walking supernova himself, Toshiro Mifune."
1.0,throne_of_blood,A brilliant adaptation of Macbeth set in feudal Japan. Incredibly directed by Akira Kurosawa. Absolutely stunning...which is to be expected from Kurosawa.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Probably the best adaptation of Macbeth put on screen. Kurosawa at his greatest and with powerhouse performances. The forest scene is absolutely unforgettable: the Bard would be ecstatic.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Simply sublime Cinema
1.0,throne_of_blood,By far the best version of Macbeth that I have seen. Toshiro Mifune is amazing in this role.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"to be(st ran) or not to be(st throne of blood), this is the question !!!!"
1.0,throne_of_blood,Great Kurosawa movie based on Macbeth. The final death scene was amazing and the special effects of the spirits are really cool too. The acting of Toshiro Mifune is always great. The costumes are pretty amazing too.
1.0,throne_of_blood,questions:you can act with just movement? the directors job is to anticipate human emotion? noh theatre: far is close?
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa turned Shakespeare's Macbeth into an amazing film!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A+. A version of Shakespeare's Macbeth, just in the samurai era."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Possibly the best film adaptation of Shakespeare ever. Definitely the best free interpretation, and the most cinematic."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa's compelling ""samurai"" adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth. This isn't just a typical retelling of the story or a film version of the stage play, this is much more of a character study with surprising depth and motivation. An epic film, in every sense of the word."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa's adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth. Stunning for it's time with a surreal feel to it and a story full of metaphors. A masterpiece.17 January 2009

1.0,throne_of_blood,This is actually the first film by Akira Kurosawa that I have ever saw in my life. Kurosawa brilliantly combines the same human elements of Shakesphere's tragedy MacBeth with Japanese history.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A very moving and intense treatment of Shakespeare's Macbeth. Kurasawa was a master at translating Shakespeare into Japanese culture. Mifune is terrific. Very stylistic, though, and not for everyone."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Best Shakespeare adaptation ever (followed closely by 'Ran'). Mifune's final scenes in the film are cenima at its very finest
1.0,throne_of_blood,Easily the greatest screen adaptation of Macbeth (despite the plot adjustments)
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Not so much a tragedy as it is an unrelenting nightmare. I've always found Toshiro Mifune's acting to be somewhat exaggerated, but here his ferocious paranoia is perfectly suited to the role."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"My personal favorite among Kurosawa's film. Haunting, surreal and nightmarish, this is Kurosawa's darkest film yet. Mifune's best performance in my opinion."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"great atmosphere, love the human pincushion ending"
1.0,throne_of_blood,"If not for ""Seven Samurai"" this would be Kurosawas best film period."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa coordinates the best adaptation of Macbeth on-screen and Mifune is orgiastic in the lead role.What more can you ask when you're watching two legends dancing to the cinematic rhythm?
1.0,throne_of_blood,It's Kurosawa - It's Shakespeare. What else is there left to say!
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa. Mifune. Shakespeare. I don't know what else you want from here. Another one of my undisputed favorites.I wanna be buried with this movie.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Adaptacion cinematografica de ""Macbeth"" (Shakespeare), probablemente la mejor que se haya hecho. El teatro Kabuki y Noh construyen las actuaciones, y la ultima escena es una de las cosas mas impresionantes que un ser humano puede ver."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Greatest film adaptation of MacBeth. Dark and haunting. The visuals will stick with you for a long time.

1.0,throne_of_blood,"Need I explain myself? This movie ""Kumonosu jo as it is called in Japanese is Akira Kurosawa's Magbeth! There can be no parellel to kurosawa in film history, and yes, this movie casts Toshiro Mifune."
1.0,throne_of_blood,The best Shakespeare adaptation I've ever seen. Kurosawa at his best without a doubt. The way that Kurosawa compensates for the language problems with the superb and subtle actions is genius.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurasawa directs Mifune in Japanese adaptation of the ""Scottish Play."""
1.0,throne_of_blood,Greatest finale ever? Maybe Mifune's finest performance.

1.0,throne_of_blood,WOW! when Washizu's wife goes insane & starts freaking out that just put me on edge! And the ending Washizu's arrow scene is beyond cool. chalk up yet another Kurosawa film as one of my favorites...
1.0,throne_of_blood,"the story of macbeth set in feudal japan. . . seriously, can it get any cooler than shakespeare and samurai? or am i just a complete nerd?"
1.0,throne_of_blood,One of Kurosawa's best. Possibly the most visceral screen adaptation of shakespeare yet.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"This is Kurosawa's ""Macbeth"" . The language of Shakespeare is missing but the power, evil and terror are there. The ending is jaw-dropping. A reporter asked Mifune how he managed to look so terrified during the final scene. ""Because I WAS terrified,"" he answered."
1.0,throne_of_blood,I have seen many versions of Macbeth. Kurosawa did a wonderful job retelling the story in this samauri tale. Wow! Kurosawa never fails..

1.0,throne_of_blood,"Hommes trop faibles, femmes trop fortes... le pouvoir n'est jamais dans les mains de celui qu'on croit (Cf RAN pour confirmer cette histoire)."
1.0,throne_of_blood,It's Macbeth with samurai! My first and quite possibly favorite Kurosawa. Oh my science Toshiro Mifune is amazing.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa's Macbeth. Haunting and spectacular.
1.0,throne_of_blood,an obscenely subtle movie - shakespeare in a kabuki mask. one of my fav kurosawa films
1.0,throne_of_blood,Another Shakespeare insipred Kurosawa film.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"One of my favorite Kurosawa films, and one of my favorite Shakespeare adaptations. Maniacal Noh-inspired performances, ultra spooky sets and lighting, and a finale to make one quiver all over, so to speak..."
1.0,throne_of_blood,It's Macbeth in Japan. Phenomenal story and characters. If you know Shakespeare then this film is really fun to watch to see how everything is translated through
1.0,throne_of_blood,Shakespeare in Asia.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Just great shots and superb acting. Best adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth and one of the greatest Movies ever.
1.0,throne_of_blood,The most haunting ghost in any movie shows up here.
1.0,throne_of_blood,My second favorite cinematic adaptation of Shakespeare (right behind Strange Brew).
1.0,throne_of_blood,"This movie is so creepy and good--it's like Shakespeare should have been Japanese. I mean, it's amazing. Superb attention to detail; lots of authentic samurai garb and traditional Japanese music."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Yes it is Macbeth, and yes it is done right. You can really see Kurosawa's experiences as a painter show through in the chase scene with the witch."
1.0,throne_of_blood,awesome play of shadows!!!!!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa doesn't need one more person blowing smoke up his ass, but this is by far one of my favorite adaptations of Shakespeare. If you haven't seen it then you should, if you don't want to see it you're an asshole and should kill yourself."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"The final image of Kurosawa's Macbeth character, played by Toshiro Mifune, captures all that is tragic in the warrior-king. Another of Kurosawa's brilliant war films, Throne of Blood is the best reimagining of Shakespeare to come along until Ran, nearly thirty years later."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa's best film, in my opinion. One of his bloodiest, if not the bloodiest. I saw ""Macbeth"" on stage in London earlier this year and I think ""throne of Blood"" is the definitive retelling of that play. This film is breathtaking!"
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A great chance to see a master filmmaker and a world-class actor change everything you thought you knew about ... well, something that resembles Shakespeare."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Akira Kurosawa directs this amazing retelling of Macbeth. Toshiro Mifune (Washizu) is totally believable as the betrayer, while Isuzu Yamada (as Washizu's wife) is haunting as the distraught wife.There is no better production of Macbeth in any form than this movie."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Without a doubt my favorite Kurosawa film. Has everything that makes him great.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Shot beautifully, the contrasts are unreal, the portrayal of Yama-uba is horrifying. Truly great film."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa likes to create his own tales from others before him, and others do the same with Kurosawa's work, this time, he tackles Shakespeare and Macbeth. This is a fine masterpiece, its a great visual take and a deep powerful take rooted in the annuals of time."
1.0,throne_of_blood,the awesome toshiro mifune turned into a sieve in an amazing ending. great shakespeare!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Welles's was like a bad speed trip- - -sweaty, agit. Polanski gutted it, spilt blood. But Kurosawa, he spooked Macbeth up. Into hallucination, into ghost story, into fever dream. So he wins."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Its a really good and creepy interpretation of Macbeth. Its spooky!!!!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Stunning realisation - the fortress and battles, are stunning, in a typical Kurosawa stylee."
1.0,throne_of_blood,This is one of Kurasawa's best films. Haunting.
1.0,throne_of_blood,An astounding version of MacBeth. I have my dear brother to thank for introducing me to this master work.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Maybe my favorite Kurosawa film.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa tackles Shakespeare's MacBeth. A precursor to his masterpiece Ran is almost as visceral and intriguing. This is the coldest film I have seen by Kurosawa with one of the most powerful and well executed endings of his whole library.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Oustanding photography and filming
1.0,throne_of_blood,In my opinion this is one of the only two truly great film adaptations of Macbeth.

1.0,throne_of_blood,"Macbeth re-told in medievil japan, has to be seen to be believed"
1.0,throne_of_blood,Great Japanese adaption of MacBeth. This is easily one of Toshiro Mifune's greatest works.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"amazing imagery. Toshiro Mufune finest moment. The ""Lady Macbeth"" character in her kimono slithering about like a snake was also amazing."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"One of the most perfect Macbeths I have ever seen - despite not having a scrap of Shakespeare in the script. Ferociously powerful, hauntingly believable brilliance."
1.0,throne_of_blood,A magnificent adaptation of that Scottish play (Macbeth)! One of Kurosawa's best!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A take on Shakespeare's Macbeth that captures the violent power of the story. It lacks the poetry of Shakespeare's verse, but the surreal imagery is a fine compensation. The scene in the Cobweb forest with the weird ""sister"" is so creepy. lovelovelove"
1.0,throne_of_blood,Japanese samurai version of MacBeth. Somewhat experimental and very classic.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa's best film, and the best Macbeth adaptation ever made."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Älskar samurajaction. Älskar Akira Kurosawa!
1.0,throne_of_blood,and i usually find shakespeare boring
1.0,throne_of_blood,Brilliant. A testament to the truth that Shakespeare's works reach their greatest heights when adapted rather than revered.
1.0,throne_of_blood,All i can say is WOW.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A brilliant adaption of macbeth, probably the best, even though it takes place in a japanese setting. Kurosawa tells the story in a dark and gritty manner, that it's thrilling and scary!"
1.0,throne_of_blood,Too bad it's not in color!!!
1.0,throne_of_blood,An amazing telling of the Macbeth story. I completely recommend this not just for the samurai movie fans but for the Shakespear fans as well.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa tries his hand at Shakespeare's Macbeth. The result is a massively entertaining film and one of the better Shakespeare adaptations out there.

1.0,throne_of_blood,"Mifune is the man! It's easy to see why he is one of Kurosawa's favourite actors in this electrifying performance. The ""human pin cushion"" death scene is incredible."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"This is one of the best, yet one of the most unique interpretations of MacBeth I have ever seen."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Competes for top position of a Shakespeare adaptation on film

1.0,throne_of_blood,Lady Macbeth at her most devious
1.0,throne_of_blood,"One of his real classics... the highlight is the way each frame is designed to communicate and awake all your senses... its composition, music and the costumes.."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa brings his unerring eye for indelible images to Shakespeare in this 1957 adaptation of Macbeth. By changing the locale from Birnam Wood to 16th-century Japan, Kurosawa makes an oddball argument for the trans-historicity of Shakespeare's narrative. Amazing acting and soundtrack."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa's best movie IMO
1.0,throne_of_blood,"In my opinion, this film shows mifune at his finest. My favourite ever Shakespeare adaptation, only just beating Ran."

1.0,throne_of_blood,one of the best kurosawa i've seen yet. Brilliantly Created in most every aspect.
1.0,throne_of_blood,I first saw this movie in english class where we were studying Macbeth. I think Shakespeare himself would have been happy with this adaptation.

1.0,throne_of_blood,An amazingly rich adaptation of MacBeth that may be better than the original. The images are haunting and will stay with you for a long time.
1.0,throne_of_blood,The first kurosawa film I saw. Toshiro Mifune's face in the climactic scene will never leave me.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"One of Kurosawa's best. Also, it is one of Toshiro Mifune's best performances. God knows you can't beat the ending."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"The greatest screen version of Shakespeare I've ever seen (and I've seen too many...). Kurosawa's distillation of Macbeth captures the tautness and muscularity of Shakespeare's play brilliantly, and Mifune's performance is quite possibly his best."
1.0,throne_of_blood,The master himself amking one of the best Shakespeare adaptation to screen ever...I mean wow!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was a time of light, it was a time of darkness, Kurosawa exploring the duality of a mind and the versatility of life."

1.0,throne_of_blood,I think this may be Kurosawa's best Shakespeare adaptation.

1.0,throne_of_blood,"Now, that's a Lady M!"
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa retells Macbeth. Mifune brings it to life and risks his life (for real) to tell this tale. One of many movies that I believe everyone should see.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Shakespeare's Macbeth set in fuedal Japan, with suitable twists and cultural modifications to make this a genuine story all its own. The ending is superb. Now if only the real Macbeth were this interesting!"
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Visually its amazing, Mifune's acting is stark and so confident. This movie along with ""I Live in Fear"" just cements Mifune as my favourite actor. Its hard to pick a favourite Kurosawa film but this one keeps coming out on top. Its definitely his creepiest."

1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa directs this best Shakespeare adaptation ever.Mifune stars as a man driven mad with power etc.The scene when the Trees come to life is still frighteningly real and effective. I have no idea how they pulled off an effect like that back in '57.

1.0,1000013-12_angry_men,"This masterpiece was Sidney Lumet's first foray into directing and what a debut it was. This classic takes place in only one room, with only twelve actors (hence 12 Angry Men). I was riveted throughout and was wrapped up in Henry Fonda's performance. A film that any movie buff should own."

1.0,1000013-12_angry_men,"Simplest and the best court room drama. It's a story about how a single man can use his argument to change the decision of all the other jury members on a murder case.

1.0,1000013-12_angry_men,"This may be a matter of a personal taste, but I enjoyed this a bit more than Citizen Kane, simply because you get so much out of every character, rather than having every lesser character be underplayed.

1.0,1000013-12_angry_men,"I guess it sounds a little boring. A whole hour an a half in one setting. But it is pretty interesting. The acting is good for the time, the film is from the 50s so it is before method acting. But this is till a must see movie."

1.0,city_lights,Every aspect of it works so well
1.0,city_lights,Perhaps my favourite Chaplin film. It's between this and The Great Dictator.
1.0,city_lights,Chaplin's greatest film.
1.0,city_lights,"Chaplin's Masterpiece!!! And believe me, that's much to say!!"
1.0,city_lights,"Despite some gaps in logic such as the cure, and the eccentric millionaire parts, this film contains the most tender romance in the history of film, and thus, rightly deserves its masterpiece status. It is Chaplin's crowning glory, and possibly the greatest ending in the history of film."
1.0,city_lights,"(SPOILER ALERT) This film gave me another definition of comedy: ""A misunderstanding blown way out of proportion"" -- this is evident when our beloved Tramp is mistaken for a burglar, even though his millionaire friend gave him one grand to give to his leading lady."
1.0,city_lights,"Falling in love with a blind flower girl and befriending a suicidal millionaire are just a few of the Tramp's antics in this fun Chaplin classic. Although the plot and resolution can seem a little far-fetched and ridiculous, I would argue this to be Charlie Chaplin's finest work."

1.0,city_lights,"City Lights is the #1 Romantic Comedy according to AFI and I agree hands down. If you enjoy the genre this masterpiece is a must see. It will make you laugh, cry and it will linger in your thoughts long after watching it. How many movies can do that?? Not many."
1.0,city_lights,I don't know if a movie can ever get any better than this.
1.0,city_lights,so sweet and funny. it's so fun watching this movie over again and noticing all of the things that have been referenced in so many other films and tv shows.
1.0,city_lights,He he. Morsom film som må sees. Ikke bli skremt av at det er en stumfilm.
1.0,city_lights,Charles Chaplin is a movie-making genius. I dare you not to laugh!
1.0,city_lights,Deffinently one of Chaplin's Greatest films.
1.0,city_lights,I think this is Chaplin's best film. Chaplin is at his best and the emotional roller coaster ride you go on in this movie leaves you exhausted by the end (in a good way). You can't help but feel for The Tramp as he does everything he can to help this blind flower girl.
1.0,city_lights,"A la fin, quand la jolie fleuriste dÃ©couvre l'identitÃ© de son bienfaiteur, impossible de ne pas fondre en larmes."
1.0,city_lights,"Beautiful set pieces. The blind girl. The Tramp. And the flowers. A great romantic delight from start to end. The prizefight part is one of the early comedies greatest achievement. And the final scene is just hearbreaking, despite the fact that the couple find each other in the end."
1.0,city_lights,The best Charlie Chaplin film!
1.0,city_lights,My favorite Chaplin performance and one of his best ever. Both poignant and prodigious in the era of Silent Films. An ardent display of great pantomime comedy and solemn romance that has an ending that will make you reach for a tissue.
1.0,city_lights,"The ending of this movie says it all. If you can watch it and not shed a tear you are in need of a doctor to check for a pulse. This movie is moving, funny, and a true classic."
1.0,city_lights,"This film just makes me feel overwhelmingly happy! A rare occurance, and probably the only romance I will ever like."
1.0,city_lights,Wow. This is something special.
1.0,city_lights,Easily one of the best movies ever made. =]
1.0,city_lights,Great movie. For a silent film it manages to have humor and romance blended in well together. The final scene is impeccable.
1.0,city_lights,Definitely one of the best endings to any film I've seen.
1.0,city_lights,"Not only is the film funny, but it contains a great measure of poignancy. End scene is *the* most moving in cinema."
1.0,city_lights,Classic silent cinema from a great pantomime. The resolution with City Lights may be one of the best in cinema. A funny and charming narrative with the beautiful Virginia Cherril.
1.0,city_lights,"Bellissimo. La scena finale è la più commovente della storia del cinema. E' divertentissimo, ma è anche drammatico, è romantico ma è anche impegnato, la musica (dello stesso Chaplin) è incredibile; c'è tutto, manca solo il sonoro ma non ci si fa proprio caso..."
1.0,city_lights,"One of those shows which directors repeatedly pay homage to, and deservingly so. The acting, comic timing, visual gags, and the lovely lovely ending make this timeless. And the boxing match is arguably one of the best comic scenes ever."
1.0,city_lights,Chaplin's most emotionally rich film. The final scene is a tearjerker.
1.0,city_lights,"This seems to be considered Chaplin's ""masterpiece"" by many, but my favorite is still Modern Times."
1.0,city_lights,"La mejor historia de amor se cuenta en silencio. Definitivamente una de las peli­culas que uno debe ver para decir ""yo he vivido""."
1.0,city_lights,Absolutely priceless...This film set the bar for all romantic comedies to come and very few (if any) have managed to live up to it.
1.0,city_lights,"tho i still think ""Modern Times"" is Chaplin's best...this one nearly ties it.....an absolute must see..the scene where the cat knocks the pot onto Chaplin's head while he sniffs the girl's flower is HILARIOUS...also the boxing match-PRICELESS..and then of course the tearjerker ending =masterpiece"
1.0,city_lights,Beautiful! I haven't been able to stop thinking about it.
1.0,city_lights,"Whatever superlative you like, use it."
1.0,city_lights,"It may be a silent movie, but the movie speaks volumes."
1.0,city_lights,A silent movie so good that even my 9 and 5 year olds love it.
1.0,city_lights,simply amazing. the ending truly is one of the greatest in cinema
1.0,city_lights,"Excellent Charles Chaplin film. Behind 'Modern Times' and 'The Great Dictator' for me, but it was amazing. One of the simplest definitions of a romantic comedy before the genre lost its touch along the way."
1.0,city_lights,"If the ending doesn't make you cry, you have no soul.Endlessly brilliant, funny, and so delightful; no matter how many times I watch it, it remains fresh, and further proves the genius of Charles Chaplin."
1.0,city_lights,My favorite Chaplin film. Everyone should see this movie about Chaplin's love for a blind flower girl and his attempts to get money from a drunken millionaire to restore her eyesight. The boxing scene is classic Chaplin and the ending is sure to bring a tear to your eye.
1.0,city_lights,THE LAST MINUTE.OH MY GOD.
1.0,city_lights,Chaplin's best film. An absolute joy to watch. One of the most poignant love stories as the Tramp tries to woo a blind flower girl. The ending is pure gold and brings a tear to my eye.
1.0,city_lights,"Arguably Chaplin's greatest silent, ""City Lights"" is a true masterpiece. With the universal message that love is blind, ""City Lights"" is a comedy that could make you cry (if you're the type--I personally never cry during movies)."
1.0,city_lights,"Saw this in my film class and enjoyed it quite a bit. Charlie Chaplin was hilarious, but the scenes with his crush were what stood out for me. Just a great movie overall."
1.0,city_lights,"Perfection in pantomime. Absolutely the best film ending, ever!"

1.0,city_lights,Hilarious as well as touching; the ending is pure perfection.
1.0,city_lights,"Funny, touching, brilliant. One of the greatest film endings ever. I love this movie."
1.0,city_lights,One of the best Chaplins of all time. Also was listed as the top romantic movie according to the AFI. The boxing scene is also one of Chaplin's most classic+hilarious gags. Just a phenominal piece of movie making.
1.0,city_lights,I'm a big fan of Chaplin and hadn't seen it yet. When I saw recently that it was chosen as AFI's top romantic comedy of all-time I figured I was really missing out. I was right. It's a sweet story with great performances.
1.0,city_lights,His final smile is priceless. Chaplin shows more romantic passion here than most other movies without the benefit of a single spoken word. Timeless.
1.0,city_lights,One of my absolute favorite movies.
1.0,city_lights,Nobody does it better.
1.0,city_lights,Beautiful story... still fresh!

1.0,city_lights,Toda la pelicula y en especial la escena donde la cieguita confunde al vagabundo con un rico son geniales
1.0,city_lights,"AFI recently named this the greatest romantic comedy of all time. I agree. This movie combines pathos and comedy in a completely unique way. Probably the best final scene of all time in a movie. If you only see one silent film in your life, this would be the one to see. Long live the Tramp!!!"
1.0,city_lights,A very cute love story!
1.0,city_lights,One of the greatest movies ever made!

1.0,city_lights,The ending of this movie always makes me cry.
1.0,city_lights,I love this film so much. It is the best from Chaplin.
1.0,city_lights,amazing funny and much better than many films today! very original
1.0,city_lights,"Chaplin, come ha fatto Benigni con LA VITA E' BELLA, riesce a toccarci in cuore cosi' puramente attraverso la commedia. Il suo personaggio Il Tramp e' puro e sincero in ogni sua azione di tenereza, pericolo, malinteso. Alla fine di questo film, lei veramente riesce a vedere lui!"
1.0,city_lights,The most touching scene in movie history is at the end of this film...if you are not moved to tears when you see it you must not have a heart

1.0,city_lights,"The best love story I have ever seen. If the last scene doesn't make you cry, you must bleed ice-water."
1.0,city_lights,"Chaplin is the city lights. He saved the millionaire and helped the blind girl. The irony is that the millionaire never recognize him and the girl cannot see.  At closing, the girl reunited Chaplin via a touch of hand. How sentimental."
1.0,city_lights,Uma das melhores atuações do Chaplin!
1.0,city_lights,Chaplin's masterpiece.
1.0,city_lights,A very good classic black and white movie. It is sad and hopeful. I would really like to know what's happening AFTER the end. (My daughter's favourite part is the boxing game. She is 5 years and loves Charlie Chaplin.)
1.0,city_lights,La mejor pelicula de Chaplin. Logra el perfecto equilibrio entre lo comico y lo patetico y tiene un final que le partira el corazon al mas duro.

1.0,city_lights,Boxing scene is the higlight for me

1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,"STELLAr performance from Marlon Brando playing a psychotic alpha-male. I've only seen the director's cut of this movie, which is just a few minutes longer, so I can only imagine what a disservice the censors did to 1951 audiences by forcing Kazan to release a sanitized version of this film."
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,Hahaha. No consensus yet on Streetcar? Let's go ahead and agree on one. It's one of the best movies of all-time. Brilliantly written. Brilliantly directed. Brilliantly acted. It is the beginning of Brando's takeover of Hollywood as the best film actor of all-time.

1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,there is so much to be discussed about this awesome movie like other plays by Tennessee Williams.
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,"A movie that constantly challenged the norms and the censors. It changed cinema forever. Raunchy, dramatic and powerful, this film is a classic within its own category. Marlon Brando became a star because of this film and the play it was based on."
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,brilliant masterpiece
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,Probably one of the top five best films ever made.
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,A true classic. Vivien Leigh and Marlon Brando: amazing.
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,Arguably the greatest display of ensemble acting ever to grace the screen. Brando makes a brilliant debut. Karl Malden and Kim Hunter turn out amazing performances but the movie truly belongs to Vivein Leigh. Her heart-breaking performance still moves me.
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,"The delicate, fragile, southern woman Blanche, the arrogant and violent Stanley, conflicts between two different lives, stunning performance by Vivien Leigh and Brando, with some controversial footage having been deleted, all make this a masterpiece."

1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,"An incredible cast, beautiful photography, and a sweltering New Orleans landscape bring Tennessee Williams' twisted yarn to life."

1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,"An absolute masterpiece that is unbearably rich in every aspect. Yes, the acting is what stands out, as well it should, but when really analyze it for what it is, it amazing in every sense. How this did not win Best Picture is beyond me!"
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,My favorite movie of all time!
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,Should have won an Oscar. Stunning film.
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,"If it weren't for Vivian Leigh's tormented and insecure nature along with Marlon Brando's macho, manly bravado, this movie would be quite boring."
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,"Top-notch, superlative American classic released at the exact right time. Kazan's melody dedicated to aristocratic tendencies and male despotism is a really solid diamond worth holding the rest of our decades.  99/100"

1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,Top notch performances but the entire cast. Brando is electrifying as Stanley Kowalski. Vivien Leigh gives one of the great performances in cinema as the mentally unstable Blanche DuBois.
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,Boring chick flick. 1950s Lifetime television bullshit.And Tennessee Williams? Could you possibly have a more pretentious name? God! Wasting my time with these stupid black and white movies.

1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,"It's a dynamite explosion when a brutish, heartless man gets caught up in the life of an emotionally disturbed, incurably romantic, sensitive teacher. Brando and Leigh give epic unforgettable performances, aided by that quintessential supporting actor Malden in this tragic masterpiece."
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,Wow! How did this ever make it out in the fifties? The enforced modesty of the period only makes the film sleazier and sexier than ever. Could a producer do as good a job today?
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,"""A movie named Desire"" in my opinion. This one is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again. So, ""Stella! Come and watch this movie with me.

1.0,fantasia,Incredible animation/visuals
1.0,fantasia,"Fantasia is always forgotten. When people do remember it, they never have anything to say about it. This film is full of probably Disney's best hand-drawn animation all played out to history's best music. This film could be timeless if people would just give it a chance."

1.0,fantasia,really enjoyed this film
1.0,fantasia,Best Animated Feature of All Time.
1.0,fantasia,Just because this movie has no story doesn't mean it sucks. The animation mixed with several different classical pieces works so beautifully and brilliantly that it ultimately makes the film one of Disney's absolute greatest accomplishments.

1.0,fantasia,"Disney's true masterpiece!Without Fantasia, the music would be difficult to use for inspiration.Plus there's a splendid combination between live-action (hence the orchestra) and animation; Mickey Mouse shaking hands with the music conductor (epic!)"
1.0,fantasia,Excellent. Top-notch animation that's very vibrant and bursting with life that goes perfectly with the associated musical numbers.
1.0,fantasia,Music and magic:) I particularly enjoyed the Schubert piece.

1.0,fantasia,one of my favorites. this was all done before CGI
1.0,fantasia,"Stunning and beautiful animation matches the music perfectly. While there is no concrete narrative, Fantasia doesn't need one as it is more along the lines of an experience than a traditional movie. An experience, I believe, that shouldn't be missed by any fan of animation or orchestra music."
1.0,fantasia,"Marvelous animation and wonderful music, a lovely mixture of the two"
1.0,fantasia,"Even at 71-years-old, Fantasia is a unique artistic experience that has yet to be properly duplicated. Walt Disney's one time failure has proven to be one of his biggest successes."

0.0,fantasia,"Not a fan. I dont see how its a good movie to watch. I dont know of any person who would even consciously say, hey you know what i havent seen in a while? Fantasia, lets do that to ourselves. Never. Blarghaflargh"
1.0,fantasia,I personally loved this film. I don't think you will enjoy on bit of it if you don't like artwork or music. I loved how they associated the film/ artwork in the same rythym with the music being played. It really bridged the gap between art and music.
1.0,fantasia,Chernabog (Satan) is the most compelling character of the entire film.
1.0,fantasia,Great visuals and Music 5 out of 5
1.0,fantasia,"I really liked this movie, because it is just great and soothing to listen to like it will always but you in a good mood. Also the colors and pictures are very cool too! They use classical music for this movie, like Bach. The first song they play gets kind of aggressive then goes soft."
1.0,fantasia,"Fantasia may not have any dialogue, but I have a feeling that that is what makes it great. The animation is over its head for the 1940s, and the music that accompanies the sequences is charming. This one is still perfect in my book."

1.0,fantasia,"This is, by far, one of Disney's best films of all time."
1.0,fantasia,"It's been said that Fantasia isn't as good for kids as much as it is for adults and nerdy kids. It's defiantly an acquired taste but never the less Fantasia is beautifully made movie with a unique strategy of storytelling, and in my opinion it is the best Disney movie ever made."
1.0,fantasia,This is the closest thing I've seen Disney do that transcends animation into the realm of art. It's real food for the soul stuff. And all of its small failures seem only to add shading and depth to the over all exquisiteness of the film.
1.0,fantasia,The best animated musical ever.
1.0,fantasia,Best Film when I was a child. This is just amazing
1.0,fantasia,music with visual effects in perfect harmony
1.0,fantasia,"An original, inventive, imaginative and creative experience that, found in only a handful of films, allows audiences to create their own interpretations of the images on screen and turn them into meaning. Beautiful, colourful and brilliant, its one of the first exercises in excess movies released."
1.0,fantasia,"Disney's best. It surprises me why films like 2001 and Fantasia (films with little dialogue) aren't common. I know audience have come to except speech in film, but the music gets by so much more and is fantastic."
1.0,fantasia,Ok...we need it with a new full digital recording.We also need another Fantasia in full 3d
1.0,fantasia,"A beautiful, colorful, animated movie with lovely music and excellent animation. 5 out of 5."

1.0,fantasia,"Truly an original form of animation, one not dependant on funny dialogue or well known voice over talent, but simply a wonderful blend of classical music and an interpretation of that music through animation.

1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Great movie, Jack Benny perfect ham and Carole Lombard is always great."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"One of the top 10 comedies of all time. Jack Benny as Hamlet, directed by the great Ernst Lubitsch, one of Carole Lombard's last roles. The inspiration for Hogans Heroes. The immortal line ""What Hitler did to Poland, he did to Shakespeare!""."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"To Be or Not to Be is a relevant and layered satire, a blend of dark humor and sight gags, of comedy and morality."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Laughing at Hitler 25 years before Mel Brooks and making political suicide gags 21 years before Stanley Kubrick. I see you, Herr Lubitsch."

1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,A comedy about totalitarian political system.
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"""To Be Or Not To Be"" was one of the greatest films made during World War II. Jack Benny and Carole Lombard were perfectly cast, however my vote goes to the greatest scene stealer of them all, Sig Rumann, in the role of ""Zo They call me Concentration Camp Erhardt?"""
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,A must-see. A film lampooning Hitler to great comedic effect in 1942. Absolutely incredible.

1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,The greatest comedy ever
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"To think that a German director made this in 1942 is incredible. Ernst Lubitsch was laughing in the face of tragedy. Although serious themes are dealt with and mild peril is encountered, I was in stitches throughout. The Lubitsch Touch is in full effect."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Hilarious movie, one of the funniest films I've ever had the pleasure of watching."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,Ernst Lubitsch at his best.
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,a classic comedy unknown to many
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,Amazing blend of drama satire and comical silliness all around a tragic wartime story. Lombard was the beat female comic of the day and Jack Benny pulls of his only worthy movie role of a lifetime.
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,Lubitsch somehow finds a tone that perfectly balances comedy and gripping tension as you wonder how the characters will get out of predicament after predicament. Downright hilarious.
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"favorite line: heil myself....  ""why haven't you seen this really funny film yet?"" ....THAT is the question!"
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Otrolig glÃ¶d och udd med humor Ã¤r minst lika svart som ss-uniformen. Jack Bennys ""Heil myself"" som Hitler Ã¤r ju en omedelbar klassiker. Men detta Ã¤r lÃ¥ngt mycket mer Ã¤n bara en catch phrase-komedi."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,Esta comedia es más moderna en su timing y su estructura que muchas de las actuales. Una verdadera genialidad.
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"A daring, and ruthlessly funny, Nazi satire."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"It's certainly one of the finest comedies ever to come out of Paramount, the allegations of dubious taste missing the point of Lubitsch's satire - not so much the general nastiness of the Nazis as their unforgiveable bad manners"
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Made at the height of World War II, this satirical comedy is a perfect vehicle for Benny."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"glorious, unlike the latest tarantino wankfest."

1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Excellent comedy script. Inteligent, very authentic, flirting with other genres."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,We should all cry for living in a cinema world without Lubitsch the Prince Charming.
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,This must have pissed old Adolph off some what.A corking comedy and Benny was never better.A propoganda masterpiece....Heil Me!
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Hilarious, clever and ultimately relevant. But the directing is just incredible. The cuts, the structure, the timing and the pacing, even if the movie was awful it would be a pleasure to watch."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,Most folks know the Mel Brooks version but this is the orginal. If you HAVEN'T watched the Mel Brooks one watch this one FIRST!!! Mel is great and all but for a great old flick this is one of the best!! Comedy!! ACTION!! Nutzi's!!

1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"A brilliantly funny comedy from Ernst Lubitsch, portraying the oppression of the European countries under Hitler's rule while simultaneously reveling in the freedom to make fun of the Nazis to its heart's content. Wonderfully funny, greatly acted and marvelously written. Just a superb film."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"""Heil Myself."" A truly classic film. I saw it today on TCM and fell in love with it. Apparently just after filming the Japanese bombed pearl harbor. Actress Carole Lombard then became a activist selling war bonds but died in a plane crash. This was her final film."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,Undoubtedly one of the most brilliant comedy classics of all-time. Here is the master Ernst Lubitsch at his best. Carole Lombard and Jack Benny are just magnificent. Truly one of the greatest scripts in the history of cinema.

1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"I just discovered this movie recently, and I absolutely love it. A group of Polish actors foil a Nazi plot during WWII, but that's just the backdrop for a screwball comedy perfectly suited for Carole Lombard. Jack Benny is also great as her hammy husband."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Magistral Lubitsch. Y la escena del monologo de Hamlet, para llorar de risa hasta que se le sequen a uno los ojos. Obra Maestra."

1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"A later Lubitsch, but not a lesser one.  Still hilarious and, one must say, rather brave, aping Hitler and Nazism right at the start of America's involvement in the war.  Plus, it stars Jack Benny. JACK BENNY. How fucking cool is that?"
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"without question, of the greatest movies of all time. the lubitsch touch is in full effect! the entire cast is simply brilliant and everyone delivers with top comedic timing especially jack benny (why didnt he act more!) and the resurgently popular carole lombard. quotable and hysterically funny."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,Just watch it. You'll understand.
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,Superby Lubitsch comedy bravely playing fast-and-loose with Hitler barely a year after Pear Harbour. A stunning achievement in which the laughs keep coming despite - or because of - how serious the jeopardy seems to be.

1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"If Casablanca is the perfect film, ""To Be Or Not To Be"" is the perfect comedy. Dark, smart, well written, acted and directed -- I think this is Lubitsch's greatest film."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"""Shall we drink to a blitzkrieg?"" ""I prefer a slow encirclement.""  Masterful comedy, sublime drama and undoubtedly Jack Benny's finest performance; absolute clasisc."

1.0,101_dalmatians,An instant classic to close Clyde Geronimi's brilliantly-directed contribution to the Disney animated features canon. One of my favorites as well due to plenty of ROFLcopter moments from the villians.
0.0,101_dalmatians,not the biggest fan of the dalmation movies.
1.0,101_dalmatians,the animation is superb and they actually give character to pretty much every dalmatian. Cruella is a great villian and probably one of the most memeorable since its 1961 release.

1.0,1012007-laura,"""Laura"" gives nothing away, and makes for a good watch."
1.0,1012007-laura,"Laura is the film that has everything that you can look for in a film noir, intrigue, a tortuous plot, a bad mannered cop but clever at the same time, a precious lady called ""dame"" by the cop, and some exquisite dialogues especially when Mr. Waldo Lydecker is involved."
1.0,1012007-laura,An absolute must see for all mystery and or film noir fans. An engrossing story and unforgettable score sets this film apart. Great acting by Clifton Webb...Gene Tierney....Vincent Price...and many others. An all time great!
0.0,1012007-laura,"My dad wanted to name me Laura after this film, mom said no. Loved Gene Tierney, but the movie was just awful. I guess my taste in murder is more sophisticated than my parents."

1.0,1012007-laura,one of the ebst film noir that i ever watched
1.0,1012007-laura,Laura is great classic that decorates the idea of obsession with a sympathy aspect. It's an original idea and one that has a plot twist that even a seasoned movie-goer could miss. An excellent thriller.
1.0,1012007-laura,Favorite film noir film so far...
1.0,1012007-laura,"I first saw this movie back in the early Eighties. Beautiful Gene Tierney is wonderful. Dana Andrews is perfect for the role. Clifton Webb is perfect. Dame Judith Anderson is perfect. Great plot, great camera, great director. Great score......"

1.0,1012007-laura,"Gene Tierney is so beautiful from playing Laura to Mrs Muir in The Ghost and Mrs Muir, she had such screen presence. This is a movie that makes you exercise your brain cells, as it unfolds. The haunting music and the portrait add to the feel of this movie."
1.0,1012007-laura,One of the best of the film noir mysteries. Superb acting from the whole cast.

1.0,1012007-laura,"a wonderful movie that can never be properly reviewed without it being a spoiler. frankly, Otto Preminger, Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews were never better and Clifton Webb plays a marvelous Waldo Lydecker. Also read the book by Vera Caspary. A classic in film noir and HIGHLY recommended"
1.0,1012007-laura,Incredible mystery/suspense/thriller!!! Highly recommend!!! Gene Tierney is magnificent in this !!!!
1.0,1012007-laura,"This was superbly done! And Dana Andrews is just hot, what I can I say? I was very jealous of Gene. :)"
1.0,1012007-laura,brilliant noir movie that made me understand the appeal of gene tierney
1.0,1012007-laura,"This film is amazing! It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time, although it was slightly predictable. 5/5 stars.I watched this and The Maltese Falcon (1941) at around the same time, and although the latter is a great movie and is considered to be a classic, I liked this one much better."
1.0,1012007-laura,Otto Preminger's Laura is brilliant. This movie is most certainly my favorite black and white film.
1.0,1012007-laura,"Classic film making here. If the score alone doesn't move you, then the very sweet and effective acting by the beautiful Gene Tierney and suave Dana Andrews will. Their short moments on screen are romantic and enchanting. I've always enjoyed this movie, and can watch it just about anytime."
1.0,1012007-laura,"The best mystery/triller I have ever seen!!! I was glued to the screen. There are many twist and turns in the movie, and the end is very suspensful!! Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney are such a cute couple, too! It's not one of the most famous classics, but I suggest that everybody should see it."
0.0,1012007-laura,"Another of those black &white; classics I was not impressed with. Gene Tierney has the charisma of a mule, which is bad since every man is drooling over her."
1.0,1012007-laura,One of the best movies ever
1.0,1012007-laura,"The plot, Gene Tierney's ethereal beauty, and musical score will haunt you forever!"

1.0,1012007-laura,The first Film Noir I watched and loved.
1.0,1012007-laura,Gene Tierney is a very seductive good girl with an edge. This film reminds me of Barbara Stanwyck as Lily Powers in Baby Face. It is amazing what a man will do to hold down a woman with power...
1.0,1012007-laura,Wonderful acting. Great story!
1.0,1012007-laura,Great movie! Everyone was a very very very possible suspect and it kept you guessing the whole way through.

1.0,1012007-laura,Excellent film noir classic.
1.0,1012007-laura,"This movie is remarkable. Usually these films get caught up in trying to be more than they need to be, but Laura is perfect in every way."
1.0,1012007-laura,Gene Tierney is beauty personified. Film noir at its best with Vincent Price as scheming ex lover and Dana Andrews as obsessed cop. Directed by a great exponent of film noir Otto Preminger.
1.0,1012007-laura,love it seen it million times
1.0,1012007-laura,Mystery extrodinaire with a beautiful Gene Tierney and Clifton Webb as the forlorn admirer. Dana Andrews plays the cop who falls in love with a ghost or is she.
1.0,1012007-laura,Elegant high-end film noir with a great quartet of main characters. Beautifully photographed in glorious black-and-white.
1.0,1012007-laura,"I just love this movie. Tierney shines, but Dana Andrews really makes this film work. Webb is amazing in this. He is so delightfully evil and nasty..."
1.0,1012007-laura,"VoilÃ  un classique dont je ne parviens pas a me lasser...Sans doute la morte la plus fascinante de toute l'histoire du cinema...Et puis il y a Gene Tierney, sublime...Dana Andrews se prend un peu pour John Wayne, par contre, mais il a quand meme de la classe...Otto, du bist ein Genius!!!"
1.0,1012007-laura,Another top Film Noir.

1.0,1012007-laura,"As the synopsis says, Clifton Webb at his prissiest! Fabulous, taut film. You forget how much films used to accomplish in 90 minutes!"

1.0,1012007-laura,My favorite film noir of all time.
1.0,1012007-laura,An awesome portrait of longing and its effect on all of the characters. Damn good fliclk.
1.0,1012007-laura,One of the best film noirs ever made. Dana Andrews should be more well known than he is. Clifton Webb steals the show in this one though.
1.0,1012007-laura,Film noir at its finest.
1.0,1012007-laura,"Glorious film noir! Clifton Webb plays a creepy vaguely homosexual wit who has turned Gene Tierney into a big success. But she keeps falling in love with cheaply handsome men like Dana Andrews, which drives Clifton's character mad!"
1.0,1012007-laura,"Thrilling, witty, disturbing, and with one hell of a twist that I didn't see coming it is one of the best Film Noirs of the '40s."
1.0,1012007-laura,"Gene Tierney and a classic song, now a standard."
1.0,1012007-laura,"A noir classic. It's quite a different piece of noir too, starting as it does with the main character dead... But it quickly unravels into a genuine mystery that does leave you guessing, and leading to a chilling climax."
1.0,1012007-laura,"Weirdly enough, I find this movie somewhat erotic."
1.0,1012007-laura,"This movie is just so great, specially in the way it manages suspense. It happened to me that in one part like for five minutes I couldn´t take my eyes off of the screen. I highly recommend it."
1.0,1012007-laura,THE movie to cozy up on over a rainy Saturday.
1.0,1012007-laura,"Great love story and mystery. I was named after the theme song, Laura (David Raksin)---Mom loved the music."
1.0,1012007-laura,"Saw it when I was a teenager at the local independent theatre... it was part of a Gene Tierney cycle.Fell in love with Preminger and Tierney right there, right then.Dana Andrews and Vincent Price are a fantastic duo.A must see, really!!! It's perfect!"
1.0,1012007-laura,The BEST of them all !!!! Gene I love ya

1.0,1012007-laura,One of the best film noir ever with the lovely Gene Tierney.
1.0,1012007-laura,Very dense noir. Still powerful.
1.0,1012007-laura,"I'm a huge fan of old film noirs, and this is one of the best"
1.0,1012007-laura,An excellext mystery! Stylish and classy. Dana Andrews grabs our attention and takes you along for the ride!

1.0,1012007-laura,So exciting and unexpected.
1.0,1012007-laura,"Oh, I how I adore this film...The lighting, the camera angles, Gene Tierney and the creepiness of Clifton Webb..."
1.0,1012007-laura,Excellent movie. I could watch this one again and again.
1.0,1012007-laura,Gene Tierney is perfection and Clifton Webb's acid toungue drips with vitriol in this film noir classic. It's one of the finest works ever committed to celluloid. Amazing
1.0,1012007-laura,"A pretty near perfect film. Gene Tierney is stunning. Dana Andrews is perfect here as he is in Night Of The Demon, The Best Years Of Our Lives and Beyond A Reasonable Doubt. Plus in Clifton Webb a new star is born!"
1.0,1012007-laura,Fantastic tense and noirish thriller that comes packed with an amazing twist.
1.0,1012007-laura,Film noir classic!!! Dana Andrews besotted by a portrait of a dead(?) woman.
1.0,1012007-laura,"I love this movie! I'm a sucker for well written dialogue, repartee and well groomed people. As an added bonus... Dana Andrews is so HOT!!!"
0.0,1012007-laura,"Sorry but if that's a film noir classic, the whole genre should be revised......."
1.0,1012007-laura,"As obsessed with this movie as Dana Andrews is with Laura's portrait. Drunk, passed out, watching it over and over and over..."
1.0,1012007-laura,Cool murder mystery. Dana Andrew's is the hero detective instead of the bad guy.
1.0,1012007-laura,"amazing, with an incredible story behind the key theme; the male characters are brilliantly created."
1.0,1012007-laura,"one of my favorite movies. it's got both style and depth, and it doesn't date. nicely shot, and neatly framed by the portrait on more than one level. but then, what's on the level here? and how many twists should we count exactly?"
1.0,1012007-laura,Fuck you!!! Fuck Yeah!!!
1.0,1012007-laura,Quite possibly the best film noir of all time.
1.0,1012007-laura,Every aspect of this movie is fantastic.
1.0,1012007-laura,One of my all time favourite films - and not just because of the title. This film noir is one of the genre's best. Beautifully filmed with captivating performances.
1.0,1012007-laura,"In my opinion, this is the greatest film noir ever made. The script is brilliant and the story is impossible to beat. How do you look at yourself in the mirror knowing that you love a corpse? And what do you do when you discover everything you think you know, about life, love and murder, is wrong?"
1.0,1012007-laura,"Probably my favorite ""film noir."" Intricately realized, with complex undertones."
1.0,1012007-laura,Perfect noir - great name for a movie.
1.0,1012007-laura,"Possibly the best noir film after ""The Maltese Falcon."" Intriguing and engaging even today."
1.0,1012007-laura,Very stylish suspense.
1.0,1012007-laura,A highly enjoyable film noir with plenty of twists and turns.
1.0,1012007-laura,It's one of those movies you can watch over and over again and enjoy. There's just something undefinable about it.
1.0,1012007-laura,Great detective thriller Dana Andrews is a great classic movie actor so is Gene Tierney
1.0,1012007-laura,"Film noir, great story but not overdone. Gene Tierney is great. Maybe doesn't go in depth on everything, but that just leaves you wanting more."
0.0,1012007-laura,despite Maria's best efforts I just don't see what there is in Dana Andrews - I fell asleep and I don't care
1.0,1012007-laura,"Awesome movie, and not only just because it's my name!"
1.0,1012007-laura,"I loved this film. I was a huge Twin Peaks fan when I saw this, so I noticed the influnces Laura had on the series straight away. I loved the photography & the whole mystery of the film. Definitely worth seeing for any film buff."

1.0,1012007-laura,"classic film, beautifully developed with a great plot and score."
1.0,1012007-laura,one of the best noir ever.
1.0,1012007-laura,"Noir writing at its best. This is Otto Preminger's greatest movie. And for you Twin Peaks fans, David Lynch took many of his character names (including obviously, Laura Palmer) from this movie."
1.0,1012007-laura,"I don't normally think of any particular movie as being me favourite, since they all have enough differences that it's an apples and oranges comparison situation. But if somehow, in real life, I could only have one movie available to watch for the rest of my life, I'd choose this one."
1.0,1012007-laura,"""I don't use a pen. I write with a goose quill dipped in venom.....I'll neither consider, endorse, or use the Wallace pen. I hate pens."""
1.0,1012007-laura,I know it's old.. but it is SOOOO good!! the plot is AWESOME!!!
1.0,1012007-laura,The defining movie of the Film Noir genre
1.0,1012007-laura,"Great classic film noir style. This is the film that inspired Lynch to come up with ""Twin Peaks."""
1.0,1012007-laura,"Probably my favorite movie of all time. No, it IS my favorite movie of all time. And Waldo Leidecker is not only a brilliant character, but has the coolest name of all time."
1.0,1012007-laura,Wow... This is an amazing film... Thanks to Rubio for having us watch this in class
1.0,1012007-laura,"easily some of the best characters ever. everyone involved in this film never came close to making anything even close to this, but this is one crowning achievement. it gives us some great lines and great names, ie waldo leidecker, david lynch says thanks in twin peaks."
1.0,1012007-laura,A film noir classic. Gene Tierney is gorgeous and Dana Andrews is wonderful.
1.0,1012007-laura,Vincent Price: awesome. Gene Tierney: awesome. Dana Andrews: AWESOME! This is really top-shelf noir.
1.0,1012007-laura,Excellent. Beautifully shot.
1.0,1012007-laura,Probably my definitive favourite noir; Gene Tierney dazzles while Dana Andrews pines...
1.0,1012007-laura,The plot is really really good...even if we see who the murderer is towards the end...
1.0,1012007-laura,Gene is my dream-girl!
1.0,1012007-laura,Great film noir that is chilling - the woman is dead or so you think?!? Then everything turns around probably one of the best Noir films I have seen definetly one that is timeless due to all the mystery involved.
1.0,1012007-laura,"tied for first place as fav, i never get bored watching it. incidently, there is no proof that anything mamoulian shot is in the theatrical cut of the movie. otto was sly..."
1.0,1012007-laura,"My favourite movie. Brilliant film noir, great dialogue."
1.0,1012007-laura,"One of the best film noir movies out there. The main character is dead when the movie begins, or so you think she is. Clifton Webb and Vincent Price steal the show as possible suspects in Laura's ""murder."" The movie is short, only 88 minutes, so it can keep the viewer intrigued through the lulls."
1.0,1012007-laura,"AH! I love this movie. This is definitely turned me onto old noir films. Definitely a beginning noir, it has a non gothic Vincent Price. I love this film."
1.0,1012007-laura,"By far my favorite movie ever. I could go on and on about how amazing it is, but I won't. Don't think it won't be good just because it's old or in black and white. It's one of the great movies of our time."
1.0,1012007-laura,"Gene Tierney is wonderful, and I thank my mother for introducing me to this. Film noir, love stories, and VINCENT PRICE."
1.0,1012007-laura,"Top flight movie, and possibly the best example of film noir. The theme song Laura is a jazz standard. I've played it many times. It's as good as the movie."
1.0,1012007-laura,possibly one of my favorite film noir
1.0,1012007-laura,One of the best of the best.
1.0,1012007-laura,"Classic film noir detective story worth at least one watching for film fans. Gene Tierney, Dana Andrews and Vincent Price do a great job."
1.0,1012007-laura,Great movie. Fantastic soundtrack.
1.0,1012007-laura,"A classic that defies the ages. If you're not an old movie fan, but would like to start, this is an awesome movie to start with. A film noir with the most beautiful woman who ever lived...sounds like a great synopsis to me!"
1.0,1012007-laura,Alfred Hichcock...what can i say!!!!!!!!!!????
1.0,1012007-laura,"Otto Preminger directing at his best as usual, with the beautiful Gene tierney as Laura. Read that this movie inspired partly David Lynch's Twin Peaks with ""Laura Palmer""."
1.0,1012007-laura,One of my all time favorite Film Noir. Enough said.
1.0,1012007-laura,"My favorite movie of all time. David Lynch named ""Laura"" in Twin Peaks as a nod to this film."
1.0,1012007-laura,"This is wonderful. Dana Andrews falls in love with Gene Tierney's picture after she is murdered, and from the flashbacks to her life we see what he is missing. It would spoil the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it to say what happens next."
1.0,1012007-laura,Clifton Webb!! And Gene Tierney.
1.0,1012007-laura,An old-school Film Noir that manages to play with the formula a little bit and keeps things interesting as a result.
1.0,1012007-laura,Another film noir that is a must see.
1.0,1012007-laura,"One of the greatest movies ever made. Preminger's haunting, elegant Film Noir is a fascinating meditation on the destructive power of beauty."
1.0,1012007-laura,"the best noir, crime mystery ever made in my books! i love the whole concept of Dana andrews, falling in love with this dead woman. and ya gotta love vincent price in this."
1.0,1012007-laura,"Film noir atmosphere, beautiful heroine, is she a ghost or is she real? Check out the words to the song..."
1.0,1012007-laura,"Why can't these bastards today make movies like this? Why? This had it all, good acting, writing, score, everything!"
1.0,1012007-laura,OMG THE BEST MOVIES EVER.
1.0,1012007-laura,"Gene Tierney's arresting performance makes this noir, with Dana Andrews and Vincent Price a delight."

1.0,sunset_boulevard,"One of the great film noirs, this movie stands the test of time. Brilliantly written and brilliantly acted."
1.0,sunset_boulevard,"One of my all time favorite films. This is as good as movies get. The comedy, the noir elements, Swanson's campiness and melodrama are all a perfect fit.

1.0,sunset_boulevard,"In the end I think the message of this great film is a testament of the old adage about the camera stealing the soul.

1.0,sunset_boulevard,"Billy Wilder's classic is a film noir, a dark comedy, a psychological drama, and the greatest film about the illusion of stardom."
1.0,sunset_boulevard,This film screams iconic which is ironic because it is the fall of the icon and the foolishness of taking stock of such a thing in the first place that this tragedy hinges upon. Those who know the history of the medium will appreciate this film more.
1.0,sunset_boulevard,At first I was only interested in this movie because of Carol Burnett. I wanted to know who Norma Desmond was. It's become one of my favorite movies!!
1.0,sunset_boulevard,"Bill Wilder creates this amazing Hollywood film-noir masterpiece about Hollywood, with towering performances, unforgettable quotes and an entertaining story."
1.0,sunset_boulevard,The ending scene alone is enough for me to call this film epic!

1.0,sunset_boulevard,"One of Hollywood's best -- and a satire of Hollywood itself, one that gets better with age."

1.0,sunset_boulevard,"Billy Wilders ""Sunset Boulevard"" is one of the most powerful films of the 1950s. A fascinating, touching, dark and gloomy masterpiece about one of Hollywood's has-beens in a tale of pure obsession, madness and murder."
1.0,sunset_boulevard,"Great story! Complete with the classic Gloria Swanson creep fest -""All right, Mr. DeMille, I'm ready for my close up!"" Very brave of Swanson to play the role, and a testament to her talent to do so without degrading into self-parody."

1.0,sunset_boulevard,"Movies don't get better than this. Gloria Swanson's monstrous star is right up there with Hannibal Lector and the film still feels like it was made yesterday. Go get 'em, Norma Desmond!"
1.0,sunset_boulevard,Not a dull moment in the film. It's a two hour brilliance extravaganza. It's all wonderful. It very easily could be one of the greatest films I've ever seen.

1.0,sunset_boulevard,There is nothing to say about this movie that hasn't already been said.
1.0,sunset_boulevard,great film noir and a great movie about movies. William Holden is great as allways as the prisoner of a borderline psychotic former star like many didn't fair well in the transition from silent to talking movie.

1.0,sunset_boulevard,"From the late great Billy Wilder, this film stands the test of time, is probably darker and more bleak than most of today's offerings, and still packs a social punch about fame and what it can do to even the purest of hearts. Brilliant is putting it lightly."
1.0,sunset_boulevard,"The title says it: Wilder shows us so many of the peculiarities and rich ironies that accompany that slow dip into the horizon. The moral of the story: Life, like Hollywood, is a death trap. Get out while you're young or you'll be a reclusive, neurotic old bitch married to a monkey."

1.0,sunset_boulevard,"A dark, deep picture about the disillusionment involved with fading fame and the gritty side of Hollywood. This film and DOUBLE INDEMNITY now secure Billy Wilder as one of my all-time favorite movie directors."
1.0,sunset_boulevard,A Sheer Masterpiece.
1.0,sunset_boulevard,"Somebody wisely said that it this is the most terrifying horror movie ever made, the horror of time passing by and not being able to accept it. Awesome."

1.0,searchers,"Has to be near top of the list in all genre of movies, of Westerns it is at the top. A near Perfect Movie. Wayne is brutal, maniacal and all too Human as Ethan Edwards. Rest of Cast in also Top Notch."

1.0,searchers,May be the best western film ever made. Unapologeticly shows the struggle of life on the frontier and the thin line between revenge and redemption.
1.0,searchers,"Westerns have a history of simplification and, for a long time, needed a more thorough tackling of the genre. That is why John Ford's darker undertaking starring the Duke, himself, is both a relief and the greatest revisioning of the heart of Westerns."

1.0,searchers,One of the grandest films ever made.
1.0,searchers,The Searchers has beautiful photography with such elaborate details on composition and framing. The story intensifies as we are also given some good humour and lighter tones. The sweeping scope of the valleys and deserts are attractive and there's a great handle on its art production.

1.0,paths_of_glory,An exceptional film portraying the futility of the battles of War War I and the corruption that occurs when polotics get involved in War.
1.0,paths_of_glory,"This is another one of those war movies that isn't about the special effects as it is about the characters and the war experience. It is quite a powerful film and it will not bore you, unless you're really picky about your movies."

1.0,paths_of_glory,Great early Kubrick about the futility of war.
1.0,paths_of_glory,Perhaps one of the first (and best) films to deliberately approach the war epic genre from a moral perspective. The dichotomy of the French army during WWI is exposed by Kirk Douglas's powerful performance.

1.0,paths_of_glory,"One of the greatest anti-war films ever made, Stanley Kubrick presents us a harsh, grim, emotional and an outstandingly engaging piece of the failures of blind patriotism, loyalty, corruption and war itself.

1.0,paths_of_glory,favorite line (paraphrase): look at that cockroach. tomorrow he'll be alive and i won't....favorite scene: (a no brainer) colonel daxs' apology....perfectly blends humour (quite often in a subtle manner) and fine drama.......highly recommended.....
1.0,paths_of_glory,"A beautifully shot film about the horrid bureaucratic ""principles"" that have come to define modern day war."
1.0,paths_of_glory,"Almost satirical in it's exaggerated depiction of military corruption, Stanley Kubrick's WWI Drama is an unforgettable descent into the evils of War and it's uncanny ability to strip away the compassion and nobility of the men that wage it."

1.0,paths_of_glory,"Heartbreaking. Every frame is handsomely composed, it's whip smart, and Kirk Douglas barks at the top of his lungs... good stuff.People who deride Kubrick films as lacking emotionality sometimes overlook this early gem.

1.0,paths_of_glory,"There are very few movies worthy of an 100% rating, let alone movies with a 100% rating that I would not want to watch more than once. The POV shots, the obvious injustice, and the hauntingly beautiful ending puts this movie with top three war films ever made."

1.0,paths_of_glory,Patriotic. A sublime exultation of power division and the senselessness of war. Kubrick starts to pave his road to auteur grandiosity in a way few directors in human history have achieved to do so. Breathtaking piece of art.  99/100
1.0,paths_of_glory,the best anti-war movie
1.0,paths_of_glory,One of Stanley Kubrick's greatest films - a powerful anti-war statement with a riveting performance by Kirk Douglas.
1.0,paths_of_glory,"Allez, hoe meer ge terug graaft in het oeuvre van Kubrick, hoe beter zijn films worden!"
1.0,paths_of_glory,"It's good to know that some things never change. After re-watching Paths of Glory for perhaps the 4th or 5th time (and the first time in several years), it still remains, unquestionably, the best film about war of all time."
1.0,paths_of_glory,"Hands-down the best WWI movie I've seen, and one of the best war movies out there. Kubrick is brilliant with his methods that use wit, frustration, and terror interchangeably, without ever succumbing to traditional techniques and cliches. Douglas is magnificent."
1.0,paths_of_glory,a rare masterpiece ...one of the best movies i ever saw. Its Kubrick's best in my opinion.
1.0,paths_of_glory,What a movie! What an amazingly wonderful movie about the evils of war. The ending too is one of the powerful i've ever seen. Thank you Stanley Kubrick: Master Film maker!!!

1.0,paths_of_glory,"Espectacular, la estupidez de la guerra en todo su esplendor, pelicula basada en hechos reales."
1.0,paths_of_glory,"Uncompromising antiwar reel, Kubrick matter-of-fact, class-conscious with all the exits blocked. Personal favourite: Douglas buttonholing General Staff Menjou at the dinner party. Menjou, ""There are few things more fundamentally encouraging & stimulating than seeing someone else die."""
1.0,paths_of_glory,"This movie delivers on all fronts. Worth it just for Kirk Douglas' sublime suggestion to his oily French General, ""Would you like me to tell you what you can do with that promotion, sir?"""
1.0,paths_of_glory,Stanley Kubricks anti-war masterpiece.
1.0,paths_of_glory,"This is one of the best anti-war films ever made. There's no fault with this movie, it packs a wallop so tightly in its 87 minute run time. Kirk Douglas is excellent in this. Stanley Kubrick really is one of the best filmmakers of all time, and this is one of his best and most overlooked."
1.0,paths_of_glory,Simpy the best anti-war film ever made.
1.0,paths_of_glory,"My personal pick for the most powerful anti-war film ever made. I would also rate it as Stanley Kubrick's finest achievement, largely because it has an emotional core and heartbreaking empathy for its doomed characters that many of his other masterpieces lack."
1.0,paths_of_glory,One of the best war movies ever.
1.0,paths_of_glory,My favorite Stanley Kubrick film (followed closely by Doctor Strangelove) but also one of my favorite ANTI WAR movies. I do not think any movie has captured the absurdity and insanity of Warfare better than this 1957 movie that still is still relevant today.
1.0,paths_of_glory,This film plus A Very Long Engagement pretty much sum up WW1 from the French perspective. It is hard to believe that this film is over 50 years old because it has held up so well. Just a great film.
1.0,paths_of_glory,"The best WWI movie ever made! Shows the senseless decisions in WWI that costs many lives. Kirk Douglas' best film, besides Spartacus."
1.0,paths_of_glory,"Fantastic, genuinely profound."

1.0,paths_of_glory,"Stanley Kubrick's shattering indictment of the military mindset rings true from its calm opening all the way to its gut-wrenching finale. Kubrick was never as succinct and relentless in any of his subsequent pictures. Superb writing, directing, acting, and camerawork. An absolute masterpiece."
1.0,paths_of_glory,ONE OF KUBRICK'S GREAT WORKS OF ART AND ONE OF THE TOP 5 BEST WAR FILM
1.0,paths_of_glory,One of the great war movies. The scenes of Douglas walking through the trenches are brilliant.
1.0,paths_of_glory,"One of two films that have made me cry. I did not cry when my dog died, nor when my grandfather died, nor when my grandmother died.But when the French soldiers are humming along to the poor German girl's song, I was there, crying with them."

1.0,paths_of_glory,"Kubrick's word about the war, or should I say, the absurdity of war. you can only agree with the main description - powerful, timeless and universal. it's so strong that you start to hate the army and all those fat, hypocritical generals instantly. Kubrick was a genius."
1.0,paths_of_glory,Brilliant drama piercing the depths of the soul as tormented by the horrors of war.
1.0,paths_of_glory,"A rare war film in that it keeps events to the point, varied and engaging for its entire duration exploring the military corruption within ranks and class."
1.0,paths_of_glory,"La mejor pelicula antibelica que he visto, a Stanley Kubrick hay que hacerla una estatua por haber hecho esta joya."
1.0,paths_of_glory,Paths of Glory is a tremendous film and one of Kubrick's most underrated. Kirk Douglas performance is transcendent and the action in the film is as good as it gets.
1.0,paths_of_glory,"Kubrick does it again(though technically this would be counted as his first major movie,i watched this one in the end ).The mother of all war movies."
1.0,paths_of_glory,Intense Kubrick war masterpiece about incompetent French generals who cause the death of their own soldiers in order to vainly pursue their own ambitions. They cover-up their own crimes by executing their own men. Banned for a long time in France and based on fact. Kirk Douglas is sensational here.

1.0,paths_of_glory,"This film set the bar on SO many levels! And the camera ""tracking"" shot through the trenches is still my personal favorite. Man, o man! This is the Kirk Douglas that legend was made about! Kubrick's third best film, in my opinion."

1.0,paths_of_glory,Short but very sweet (though the story is less than sweet). As expected with Stanley Kubrick this is great. It shows the measure of an artists if he/she can produce great works even in miniature form. Great acting all around in this film and a thought provoking story.

1.0,paths_of_glory,"An excellent film that was expertly written, acted and directed. Calling it ""anti-war"" is unfair in my opinion, a label it gets because t doesn't glorify battle or the people who wage it. Really it's a film railing against imperiousness and callous authoritarianism."
1.0,paths_of_glory,Kubrick's first real classic.

1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Iconic horror film, dated but still impressive."

1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Deviating from the novel, which is my favorite of the Victorian era, the fact that it was concocted by a group of simple Hollywood marketers is quite apparent. I new it would be campy, but I think that aspect made it funner to watch."

1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Frankenstein is my favorite classic horror series. Boris Karloff is the perfect actor to play the monster. In the end I really end up feeling bad for him b/c he tries so hard to fit in nobody accepts him.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Boris Karloff rules.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,I'd fuck this movie. Seriously.

1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Saw it when I was 5 years old. First horror movie I ever saw. I've been in love with it ever since.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,I always think about Bela Legosi in 'Ed Wood' calling Boris Karloff a cocksucker. But this is still a classic.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"The finest horror film ever made. James Whale is a great director. And Karloff, what an amazing, talented actor. He is responsible for the worlds greatest horror icon."

1.0,1007818-frankenstein,A classic for a reason.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Karloff is once again amazing and doesn't utter a complete sentence in the film. Wonder what it would have been like if Lugosi had not turned down the roll of the Monster?????

1.0,goldfinger,"What can't you say about this movie? It has everything, and is wonderfully cheesy and camp. This is Bond when Bond was allowed to be Bond, before he had to go on some kind of existentialist quest to save the world, and instead, could fight evil gold-obsessed bad guys."

1.0,1011615-king_kong,"Hard to say something about one of the 'classics'...still, my two cents would mention that, rather than being a ""monster movie"", or placed in the horror genre, this is quite simply an excellent adventure film, with effects that were years ahead of anything being done at the time..."

1.0,1015052-night_of_the_living_dead,"The grandaddy of all zombie movies. The stuff in this film really isn't the worst I've seen, but for 1968 it probably had audiences vomiting. Awesome movie though, really no other way to put it. I see why it's a classic."

1.0,1002448-birds,"The Birds: Hitchcock expertly builds suspence in this underated masterpeice. While expertly crafting its characters, villans and story."
1.0,1002448-birds,A classic Hitchcock flick that builds up with a long but good story and plenty of thrills. That also shines in its own right even if it is somewhat lower than his other films.
1.0,1002448-birds,The final masterpiece by Hitchcock. Hitch should've retired after finishing this one.
1.0,1002448-birds,Hitchcock does it again! One of horror cinema's finest!
1.0,1002448-birds,An obvious must-see. Still creepy to this day.
1.0,1002448-birds,"10 out of 10:Thanks to incredible special effects, acting, and directing, The Birds makes innocent animals into terrifying ones."
1.0,1002448-birds,I forgive the terrible graphics - Hitchcock's one detour into the supernatural is a fun side-trip.
0.0,1002448-birds,"Oh my gosh, how is this pile of garbage a classic. the visual effects suck, the movie isn't scary in any way, the acting is horrific, and the movie just sucks. The Birds made me laugh my head off, for that it gets more than half a star."
1.0,1002448-birds,One of my favorite movies. Still creepy and unnerving. Still a interesting and unique movie plots.
0.0,1002448-birds,It seems the plot was written by a hen and directed by Hitch'cock'.

1.0,1002448-birds,"The special effects don't hold up well, but they don't have to in order to scare the audience. If the merits of Hitchcock's films are based on his mastery of suspense, then this may be his greatest work ever."
1.0,1002448-birds,Mr. Hitchcock demonstrates he is ever the master of suspense while magnificently depicting birds as some of the scariest horror movie villains ever filmed.

1.0,1002448-birds,"Absolutely terrifying. There is nothing corny about these birds, in a horror film layered with a sly romance and an ambiguous ending that wraps up the character arcs but leaves you wondering if anyone is actually going to survive long enough to enjoy their newfound relationships."
1.0,1002448-birds,"Scary and Frightening, but I like it."
1.0,1002448-birds,Great movie that has aged well. Hitch is still better than most of our modern directors.

1.0,1002448-birds,If a movie was made today about killer birds attacking a community due to two love birds being in a cage it would be laughed at.Its Hitchcock...simple.
1.0,1002448-birds,"""The Birds"" is...awesome-tacular. It has great acting, a great script and campy special effects. It's kinda silly though."
1.0,1002448-birds,Awesome...watching right now!

1.0,1002448-birds,"There has been a debate whether this was as good as ""Psycho"" but in my mind whilst not as good it's still a classic in its own right with the vintage tension he always brings to the table and flawlessly written"
1.0,1002448-birds,"The reason I am still afraid of birds today! A must see for all, Hitchcock at his best!"
1.0,1002448-birds,This film is less about demon devil birds swooping out of the sky and more about the psychological panic that spreads through the town-and further. I really like the meticulous nature of Hitchcock and this film does not disappoint.

1.0,repulsion,when a filmmaker has a voice that is undeniable..
1.0,repulsion,"Holy what the hell AMAZING! I had never seen this, just watched first time, blown away. Catherine Deneuve is outstanding. Edgy, scary, descent into madness doesn't quite do it."
1.0,repulsion,"Polanski is masterful behind the camera, especially in his use of space. It's very gutsy and how disturbing it is is evidence of just that."
1.0,repulsion,"The perfect psychological reading that is generated in 'Repulsion' captures in very minute details the terrifying process towards total madness. If the fall to psychosis was a window into damnation, Polanski captures the very near hell of visual and sonorous master-class mosaics. 99/100"
1.0,repulsion,"While not only is this film so disturbing that you will feel as if you should take a shower after you finish it, it is also unbelievably heartbreaking in a realistic perspective. Which is why I think Repulsion is one of the best horror films of all time, even if it is a different kind of horror."
1.0,repulsion,"If you don't have claustrophobia organically, you'll likely have developed it in some form after watching this one. Another hit by Polanski. Once again Art House though... Part of The Criterion Collection and on Blu-ray in the US."
1.0,repulsion,"A disturbing, claustrophobic thriller with a fantastic performance by Catherine Deneuve and eerily effective sound design and camerawork"

1.0,repulsion,A disturbing film that hollows through a world of hallucination with unsettling horror.
1.0,repulsion,"My favourite Polanski film, this nightmarish trip into isolation and madness builds up tension and atmosphere, taking its audience hostage amid the claustrophobia and terror. The final shot (the photograph of Carol) is still one of the most powerful images in film history."
1.0,repulsion,So sweaty and so beautifully unhinged one needs a shower after watching it...
1.0,repulsion,One of the greatest psychological thrillers ever and very disturbing. Catherine Deneuve makes her best performance here.

1.0,repulsion,one of the most remarkable psychological horror movies to date.
1.0,repulsion,Spectacular! Positively my favorite movie.
1.0,repulsion,Scared the be-Jesus outta me - when that malevolent dark figure looms out of now where and attacks her repeatedly it is chilling and unnerving - this struck a chord with me...
1.0,repulsion,Repulsion is one of those unexpected gems you find! insanely great triller keeps you intrigued the whole 104 minutes and by the end will leave you speechless
0.0,repulsion,Miserable french twat goes on a mad murderous rampage and becomes so insane she irons without plugging the iron in. thoroughly dissapointing
1.0,repulsion,"One of the best, smartest, and most unique horror films ever. This is a must see."
1.0,repulsion,One of the best psychological horror films that I have ever seen. Polanski is a master of building suspense in the confines of small spaces.
1.0,repulsion,This was really something. The score. The acting. The terror. Polanski has dark sorceress powers. Completely redefines the horror movie. It's pure greatness.
1.0,repulsion,"If you have seen Black Swan and liked it, you will love this. It is even better, the original film about a schizophrenic's slow decent into madness. Absolutely astounding performance from Catherine Deneuve."
1.0,repulsion,Classic.  Catherine Deneuve is a complete stunner. Great score that fits the film perfectly by Chico Hamilton.
1.0,repulsion,Had me wincing in sheer anticipation of horror and jump out of my seat. And this was made before CGI and makeup. Roman Polanski's creepily atmospheric psychological drama about the slow descent of a girl into madness should be revered by the horror fans.
1.0,repulsion,Roman polanskis first english film follows a schizopherenic womans descent into madness and makes the audience feel as clausthrophic as the character
1.0,repulsion,We start off as innocent as the girl can be but slowly and murkily do we descend to a great pit of turmoil and disturbance. Excellent work from Polanski.
1.0,repulsion,Repulsion compels the viewer to be as claustrophobic as the paranoid lead woman as she journeys into insanity.
1.0,repulsion,Fianlly just saw this film and i'm not disappointed to movie is a masterpicie . This shows off the fPolanksis full potienal in theis surealist look in the a insaine mind. it obisouly shows its influence on directors like Lynch and Argento
1.0,repulsion,Deneuve showed that she could understand a director unlike any other actress who ever lived. Polanski's visuals and her acting make this one of the finest depictions of the descent into madness ever.
1.0,repulsion,Hands down the best Roman Polanski film in my humble opinion. And he's got a lot of good ones.
1.0,repulsion,"At first, the film exchanges excitement for eerieness, but then proceeds to capture the imagination of the viewer and keep them enthralled as Carol descends into insanity."
1.0,repulsion,a young girl loses her mind in her london apartment
1.0,repulsion,"Early Polanski. If you have seen Knife in the Water and not this, imagine a movie that has just as many emotions as knife in the water, but represented through visuals of even more horror and beauty, you get this. Polanski's first horror film and arguably his best (maybe tied with Rosemary's Baby)."
1.0,repulsion,Polanski is great and knows how to make characters!
1.0,repulsion,"Repulsion, is an emotion you certainly won't feel while watching this intense, expertly crafted masterpiece."
1.0,repulsion,"An unsettling and unfortunate story which attempts to expound a virgin's fearfull perspective on sexual relations. This, combined with elements of real physical peril and mental illness, makes for a fascinated film. Typical slow Polanski build-up and revolutionary camera work."
1.0,repulsion,"Catherine Deneuve is perfect as the disturbed, sexually repressed young french girl in Roman Polankski's masterpiece about paranoia and sexuality. Amazing."
1.0,repulsion,"Absolutely terrifying, and beautifully filmed."
1.0,repulsion,Vraiment trÃ¨s trÃ¨s bon. Catherine Deneuve est gÃ (C)niale en nÃ (C)vrosÃ (C)e-psychotique! La rÃ (C)alisation est ingÃ (C)nieuse pour l'Ã (C)poque.
1.0,repulsion,Repulsion has a mood of horror & disease that is effective & disturbing. Watching Carol break down on screen will make you squirm in your seat.
1.0,repulsion,Wow this was terrifying!
1.0,repulsion,May very well be Polanski's best film
0.0,repulsion,"Very disappointing. Pretentious piece of ""art""."
1.0,repulsion,This was made in 1965 and is still pretty impressive. The directing style is fantastic! Catherine Denevue's schizophrenia mixed in with her deep sexual impulses makes this film original and a gem.
1.0,repulsion,Very strange film about claustrophobia by roman polanski not really scary but it is a overall well done masterpiece for its time beautifully well done very thrilling movie and great screenplay co written by Polanski himself highly recommended
1.0,repulsion,Had me wincing in sheer anticipation of horror and jump out of my seat. And this was made before CGI and makeup. Roman Polanski's creepily atmospheric psychological drama about the slow descent of a girl into madness should be revered by the horror fans.
1.0,repulsion,Great rental if you can find it!!
0.0,repulsion,polanski is a child rapist
0.0,repulsion,"Perhaps this was ""substantial"" when it came out, and is a classic that people reference, but nowadays it's simply terrible. Prepare to be bored out of your mind by a character you have no reason to care about, and distracted from the suspense by over the top techniques."
1.0,repulsion,Catherine Deneuve plays Carol too well.!!. =D Polanski's camera work and the effective use of black and white throughout the film greatly enhances the mood.The ending.........
1.0,repulsion,"This film managed to really get under my skin. It gave me a serious case of the creeps, which is saying something."
1.0,repulsion,"Peli del 65, primera peli en ingles de Roman Polanski!!! que vara mas reloca!!! muy buena!"
1.0,repulsion,"Man, that was freaky."
1.0,repulsion,"I decided to give this one another chance, since I wasn't getting into it the first time around. I'm glad that I did. It's a wonderfully creepy movie."
1.0,repulsion,Absolutely terrifying.
1.0,repulsion,One of the freakiest and most disturbing movies I have ever seen.
1.0,repulsion,this movie is cold! polanksi is greatness
1.0,repulsion,This is one of the creepiest movies I have ever seen. I was as paranoid about the protagonist as I was her antagonist - loneliness. This is the kind of movie that makes you want to lock your doors and put yourself in a straitjacket.
1.0,repulsion,"Outstanding Deneuve in taut,nerve-cracking,misogyne thriller.Shall not miss it."
1.0,repulsion,"An enthralling, if not enchanting, work of art in a habitual genre to its audience at the time, but supposing that not half of the world have known yet the young talented Polanski, this film would have been his first masterpiece to reach them in a remark it would be remembered as a historical piece."
1.0,repulsion,An unquestionably perfect film.
1.0,repulsion,"The character development, the repetitions, the maddening background noises, the surreal imagery, the flawless camera direction, the empathy, the symbolism, the widening cracks..."
1.0,repulsion,This is the film Black Swan wanted to be. A flawless early effort from Roman Polanski.
1.0,repulsion,"The movie was made in 1965, though it's incorrectly dated on here as 1997. That annoyance aside, the film was genuinely terrifying and really stays with you, whether you want it too or not. Right up there with Jacob's Ladder for my all time favorite horror films."
1.0,repulsion,A disturbing film and with a great performance from Deneuve.
1.0,repulsion,"5 out of 5 - thanks to Flixter for doing everything wrong, again."
1.0,repulsion,I thought I was hearing things after watching this one.
1.0,repulsion,"Earliest proper psychological horror I've seen within the contemporary context. Highly original. However, don't bother with it if you don't like slightly low paced, black and white films."
1.0,repulsion,"One of the first Roman Polanski movies, it's a chilling masterpiece about woman's decent into madness."
1.0,repulsion,hey .... why in title is year 1997? .... It's a movie from 1965 ...
1.0,repulsion,"I don't throw around 5/5 easily, but Polanski's first English film (1965 London) is spot-on perfection. 100% on Rottentomatoes."
1.0,repulsion,"Polanski's first film of his urban terrors trilogy is efective simply because you can't never guess what is coming up next; I'm not easily impressed, but this one made me jump off my couch three times."
1.0,repulsion,"GREATTTT! film, starts out a little slow then really gets crazy. One of Polanski's ""Apartment Trilogy."" They are all good, but this one is quite insane."
1.0,repulsion,"Wierd, Yet Entertaining"
1.0,repulsion,"Haunting and claustrophobic, Repulsion places you in the room with it's disturbed protagonist, her degenerating psyche creating terrifying hallucinations, until she lashes out with violence to stop them. A classic Polanski nightmare."
1.0,repulsion,The absolute best movie I have ever seen about a woman descending into madness apart from Woman Under the Influence. I should just make a note that the criterion edition of this is MAGNIFICENT. SO CRISP & SHARP.
0.0,repulsion,"Awfully boring, then it gets annoying, and at the end a little bit interesting. Only for respect of the old perv Polanski watched till the end."
1.0,repulsion,A masterpiece from Polish master Roman Polanski. One of the most pygoloically distrubing films out there. This film is a looking into the isane and delsional mind of Carol Ledoux(played by Catherine Deneuve). Sureal and very atosphereic. This film shows that anyone can snap even you and even me.
1.0,repulsion,"Film Psychedelikohorrifique, un chef d'oeuvre noir et blanc d'une justesse et sobriété implacable et prenante."
1.0,repulsion,Repulsion is probably the best psychological thriller I've seen. A true masterpiece from a real genius Roman Polanski (Though I know he's charged with a rape case!). Don't forget lovely Catherine Deneuve:)
1.0,repulsion,"Not comfortable viewing, but for a reason. Polanski devastatingly interpets what too much isolation can do to the psyche... Draw your own conclusions."
1.0,repulsion,LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVED THIS MOVIE.
0.0,repulsion,I know I will be in the minority here but I was really dissapointed with Repulsion. Being a big Polanski fan I had been meaning to see this for some time and had high expectations. Some disturbing scenes which were good but the film just didn't seem to connect with me unlike his other works.
1.0,repulsion,Excellent... might type more laters.
1.0,repulsion,"An unsettling masterpiece, with a brilliant performance by Catherine Deneuve."
1.0,repulsion,"Absolutely horrifying. Catherine Deneuve is stunning, but I'll never be able to see her the same way again."
1.0,repulsion,"No one does a classier rape scene than Roman Polanski, The Devil and Rosemary is at the top of the list, but there were multiple ones in this so.........."
1.0,repulsion,Today's lesson: Don't leave the crazy lady alone with a straight razor.
1.0,repulsion,Disgusting. Shocking. Disturbing. Amazing.
1.0,repulsion,"The best movie Polanski has ever done, and along with The Hour of the Wolf the best paranoid movie ever."
1.0,repulsion,"This movie was a complete shock to me. I went in not expecting much, and came out hooked, compelled and excited. Barely anyone I know has seen this, but I recommend it. A slow burn that will build in tension, paranoia, and most importantly dread. Great oldie"
1.0,repulsion,"I'd have to say this is among one of my favourites now among the few really well done psychological-thrillers, such as Mulholland Dr. and Memento."
1.0,repulsion,Roman Polanski's first English language film (second overall) is perhaps the greatest psychological drama ever made. Check it out!
1.0,repulsion,Love those playful nuns out the window.
1.0,repulsion,#2 crazy chick of all-time behind Virginia in Spider Baby. Great movie!
1.0,repulsion,I love Catherine Deneuve. A great Roman Polanski film.
1.0,repulsion,I felt nothing till the end...the photo with the family...at that point I felt the sense of horror. That was all!Thnx mister Polanski. Absolutely one of my favs!
1.0,repulsion,"Nearly 45 years on it still hasn't lost any of its impact. The infamous decaying rabbit setpiece was swiped by Abel Ferrara in his 1979 feature ""Driller Killer""."
1.0,repulsion,I love this movie. You should see this.
1.0,repulsion,Fianlly just saw this film and i'm not disappointed to movie is a masterpicie . This shows off the fPolanksis full potienal in theis surealist look in the a insaine mind. it obisouly shows its influence on directors like Lynch and Argento
1.0,repulsion,"This movie is incredible. Beautifully shot, extremely shocking for it's time and in my opinion is the best cinematic portrayal of the progression of insanity that I have ever seen."
1.0,repulsion,"Alienation captured. We get to go into the depths of confusion. Polanski is able to strip away the veneer of civilization and manners. We see people in all of their rawness, and it isn't pretty."
1.0,repulsion,"Luultavasti jÃ?Â¤rkyttÃ?Â¤vin elokuva mitÃ?Â¤ koskaan olen nÃ?Â¤hnyt. Jumalainen Catherine Deneuve nÃ?Â¤yttelee hienosti tÃ?Â¤ssÃ?Â¤ leffassa. Edelleen pidÃ¤n tÃ¤tÃ¤ Polanskin pÃ¤Ã¤tyÃ¶nÃ¤, vaikka onhan Pianistikin hieno leffa."
1.0,repulsion,Awesome! One of my favorite Polanski films. Catherine Denevue is stuck in her apartment and just loses her shit...I can relate
1.0,repulsion,Great. Catherine Deneuve in one of her best!!
1.0,repulsion,crazy film! definitely one of the most disturbing films i've seen. this has so much more depth than your average thriller. and Catherine Deneuve gives a very powerful performance.
1.0,repulsion,Polanski at his some of his most disturbing and innovative. Objects and lighting are key in progressing the unraveling of an already head-case. The dead rabbit is the thickest layer of visual metaphor. The violence has high anticipation but shocking in its honesty.
0.0,repulsion,color me unimpressed. there's a reason polanski ain't allowed in the u.s. he's a sick *#%$er.
1.0,repulsion,"The most unnerving film I've seen. The more closely I watch it, the more signs of the girl's increasing insanity I pick up on. The most disturbing thing of all is that anyone in passing may be about to snap. Anyone. If seen in a theater you may want to lock your car door for the drive home."
1.0,repulsion,the very best film of Polanski
1.0,repulsion,PSYCHOLOGICAL TERROR FROM THE MASTER OF FORM POLANSKI. A NIGHTMARE COMES TRUE IN THIS DEEPLY FREUDIAN 60'S SLASHER. A CLASSIC

1.0,repulsion,The most horrifying movie I've ever seen
1.0,repulsion,Love this story. The plot was so captivating and it held my attention even though there was nothing remotely flashy. And Catherin Denuve is wonderful as usual
1.0,repulsion,"a work of pure artthough it is dark, it conveys so much about the stream between normal consciousness and psychosis"
1.0,repulsion,Repulsion is the first of the tenant nightmares presented by Roman Polanksi. Brilliantly constructed. One of the best horror movies. Nobody understands horror movies like Polanksi.
1.0,repulsion,Fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Polanski si great!!
1.0,repulsion,Voyage au bout de la folie et du repliement sur soi. Ou comment devenir sa propre phobie. Tres certainement le plus grand film de Polanski.
1.0,repulsion,"A really stunning, encompassing and chilling representation of a psychological split. Catherine Deneuve's performance is subtly shattering and Polanski films every moment with such eerie, deliberate grace."
1.0,repulsion,Classic suspense film is very atmospheric. Deneuve is fantastic and the film does not seem dated in the least.
1.0,repulsion,sultry psycho deneuve freaks out in swinging 60's Soho. silly rabbit!
1.0,repulsion,"I found this movie interesting. The way in which the camera moves to show the girls obsessions, fantasies and hallucinations is creative. Definatly different type of movie, for that era also. Very beyond its years."
1.0,repulsion,"Along with Eraserhead and Inland Empire, this is probably the best horror movie I've ever seen. If you are more terrified of mental illness than of men in hockey masks, this film is for you. Roman Polanski's debut feature and the introduction of Catherine Deneuve to the world. Remarkable."
1.0,repulsion,A great horror story!
1.0,repulsion,"fantastic soundtrack, great actress, breath-taking screenplay... this movie is the incarnation of misanthropy."

1.0,repulsion,My favourite Polanski. Deneuve is absolutely amazing
1.0,repulsion,A woman's descent into madness. Watch for the parallel between her sanity and the rabbit.
1.0,repulsion,We discovered this Roman Polanski movie completely by chance and it was great. It is particularly interesting to see how it approached this theme years before it became a complete cliche.
1.0,repulsion,"Wonderful piece of horror about a lonely girl who badly needs to get laid. Love the rotting meat, the flies, the cracks in the walls. There's really nothing like it. Except maybe The Tenant"
1.0,repulsion,This was...just an awesome movie. I'm glad The Cardigans' music video introduced me to it. : )
1.0,repulsion,"Great movie, 10/10 on the disturbometer."
1.0,repulsion,"The sentiment of this film is pure horror but in a beautifull way, achieved with the doubtless aesthetics of the masterfull Roman Polanski. Probably the most stylish film ever made. Note also the brilliant score composed by jazzdrummer Chico Hamilton."

1.0,repulsion,"Pure Polanski, with Catherine Deneuve going crazy! What more could you want? Her sister in the movie is her real-life sister who was sadly murdered. Isn't for the squeamish."
1.0,repulsion,Black and white creepy frenchness.
1.0,repulsion,"beautiful movie, an atmosphere that can hunt you in your dreams"
1.0,repulsion,"Truly amazing. And that's all due to the lead actress' very convincing and hauntingly realistic portrayal of a disturbed young woman, as well as Polanski's rather incredible direction . This film is pitch perfect as far as eerie or just outright frightening psychological thrillers go."
0.0,repulsion,"I barely made it passed the hour mark before I shut it off. Not because it's so ""terrifying"" and ""shocking"" as some people seem to think, but because it's horribly boring. Psychological thrillers were never really my genre anyways."
1.0,repulsion,The ultimate mindfuck.
1.0,repulsion,"When it comes to claustrophobic, paranoid horror movies, Polanski is the king and this is definitely the best."
1.0,repulsion,Fantastic film full of tension and unease with the fabulous Catherine Deneuve.
1.0,repulsion,A disturbing film but Catherine Deneuve is perfect and Polanski did a great job with a difficult subject!
1.0,repulsion,"An intense portrayal of a woman losing her grip on reality. Fantastic direction, and Deneuve is enthralling."
1.0,repulsion,"Mitähän kaikkea voi liikkua yksinäisen, päästään lahon naisen mielessä? Polanski ohjaa ja Deneuve tekee toisen elämänsä suurista rooleista. Taustalla kuuskytluvun Lontoon svengaa erityisen nätisti."
1.0,repulsion,"One of Polanski's best, a disturbing portrait of repression and madness. Great hallucination sequences."
1.0,repulsion,Polanski's finest hour.
1.0,repulsion,bleak creepy madness
1.0,repulsion,"Great, dark, atmospheric, shocking Polanski film; black and white, stark background music, and surreal nightmarish images make for a good time!"

1.0,repulsion,"At first, I thought this was slow and tedious, but I soon realized the genius that was behind it. There is some much in this movie that can not all be captured it one viewing. This turned out to be a very effective horror with direction that creates very real and stark imagery."
1.0,repulsion,Polanski knows his crazy. This shit is nuts
1.0,repulsion,Deneuve is beautiful and creepy at once. And the direction is fantastic. A viscerally disturbing movie.
1.0,repulsion,the inspiration for my short film leave a message
0.0,repulsion,It's the 70's through and through. For me that is usually enough. Boring.
1.0,repulsion,"One of my top ten favorites. Polanski at his best. What happens when a girl's afraid of sex? Dead rabbits show up and hands come out of the wall, obviously."
1.0,repulsion,This is a very good movie that no one remembers any more. Just look at the camera. A psychological thriller were the camera is the main character. The soul of a sick girl is revealed through the lens.
1.0,repulsion,Extremely creepy. The destruction of Carol's apartment and mind are wonderfully depicted by Polanski.
1.0,repulsion,Changed my life when I was 18
1.0,repulsion,"Absolutely fascinating and brilliant. Polanski is just the most brilliant director in these kinds of psychological horror, extremely disturbing and just brilliant."
1.0,repulsion,Better with every viewing.
1.0,repulsion,This movie is hell.. so brilliant ... remind me of Polanski's The Tenant... but Repulsion is much better....Catherine Deneuve is funtastic..

1.0,repulsion,"Polanski's finest achivement. A tail of sexual repression/repulsion and psychological illnes set against the scenary of ""swinging London"". Surreal is the main keyword for this classic."
1.0,repulsion,Astounding. Truly revolutionary. This movie changed cinema forever.
1.0,repulsion,"You need patience to see this movie. It seems slow at first, but what it builds up to is intense and disturbing...in a tasteful way, of course, which is what makes it so amazing."
1.0,repulsion,"Probably the only horror movie in the world with a groovy jazz soundtrack. Scary, nevertheless."
1.0,repulsion,"Another frightening, psychological masterpiece from Polanski. Its haunting, well crafted, briliantly acted."
1.0,repulsion,"I don't know what to say about this movie? The movie left me with my mouth open and speechless. If your a woman I'm sure you can relate with the main character and her discuss toward men, but never take it as far as she did. I definitely recommend it, Polanski is a deranged man!"
1.0,repulsion,Polanski at his best.Catherine Deneuve is wonderful

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,Wonderful film. I have seen it twice and look forward to watching it again. The sweet way that Charlie falls for Rose is something that only two wonderful actors can portray. The scene where Bogart imitates the hippos and makes her laugh is adorable. The wedding is unforgettable.

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"John Huston filmed his World War I epic on location, which was an unusual decision at the time, but the grittiness and festering of the jungle perfectly matches the griminess of our main characters, played by Bogart and Hepburn."

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"The 1951 classic that won Humphrey Bogart an Oscar and inspired the Jungle Cruise at Disneyland was every bit as awesome as I had pictured it. The special effects are definitely of their time, but that doesn't stop it from being a timeless film."
1.0,the_african_queen_1951,The first of a series of boy meets girl and they take on the world. Once again a classic movie with two of the greatest actors to ever live. Joe versus the Volcano might be said to be a take off of AQ. Very loosely. Same struggles different picture.

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"not the best bogey our katherine, but the most vivid and beautiful dynamic amongst them explodes across a backdrop so impossibly grand and metaphorically imperfect a never in a lifetime tale of unspoken dissonance dances on long after the credits fade."

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"The relationship between Bogey and Hepburn is marvelous, as they first despise each other and then long for one another. Charlie Alnut is one of cinema's best characters, often overshadowed by Bogey's own Fred C. Dobbs. A trek well-worth the taking."
1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"There are a couple stars in each generation that steal our hearts so completely we'll watch anything they're in. Bogey and Kate are both such stars, and to see them together in a well-made (John Huston) film is a delight worth savoring again and again."

They are trying to outwit the Germans travelling up river in Africa in a derelect boat. Enthralling viewing!"
1.0,the_african_queen_1951,Not a lot of true five-star movies out there. But this is one of 'em. How is it that nobody's ever remade this? Harrison Ford would be a great Charlie Allnut.

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,One of my all time favourites! The chemistry between Bogart and Hepburn is indescribable.

1.0,it_happened_one_night,I was blown away by this movie. It is directed to perfection. There is a scene where they are crossing a river that took my breath away. Also I have to say I really cared about what happened to these two flawed lovers.
1.0,it_happened_one_night,I just watched this movie for the first time and I must say I loved it. I am not a huge fan of Clark Gable but I really found Claudette Colbert intriguing. She has an amazing dialect that plays well in the film.
1.0,dr_no,"Successfully introducing everything that makes Bond great, Dr. No remains one of the best entries of the franchise nearly 3 decades later. The villain is subtly menacing, and Sean Connery gives one of the best performances of his career."
1.0,dr_no,Classic Bond flick. One of my personal favorites. The boss fight scene at the end is a little lame but the Dr. No character is a mysterious character and provides a lot of intrigue.
1.0,dr_no,The first Bond film which was released quite a long time before my days is the first Bond film I've ever seen and it's one of my favorite.
1.0,dr_no,Perfect way to start this legendary franchise. Connery bosses it in his first appearance as Bond. Good cast around him too. Beautiful filming locations.
0.0,dr_no,"boring movie with no intense edge of your seat action, cliche capture and escape segment. bond also fights like a wuss, and isn't like a spy like a actual spy with fighting talent. doesn't matter if its made in 1963 was investing at all like the rest of the other bonds."
1.0,dr_no,"The first Bond movie, an instant classic. This movie had a pretty good story and it was something original when it came out. Sean Connery makes a great Bond. Great start to a series that is still going today."
1.0,dr_no,The best spy film next to mission impossible! A true Classic.
1.0,dr_no,"10 out of 10:Packed with plenty of action, great thrills, and a great performance from Connery, Dr No starts a franchise with a bang."
1.0,dr_no,This is the 1st James Bond movie. It is one of the best action movies from 1962. The 2nd James Bond From Russia with love is better. But still this is a good movie see it.
1.0,dr_no,The movie that started it all...
1.0,dr_no,Outstanding debut Bond work from the director and Sean. Particularly loved the creation of evil with Dr. No and the introduction of Spectre which came to a round circle in the recent crap of the same name.
1.0,dr_no,An absolute classic. Perfect in every way.
1.0,dr_no,Even though I haven't seen it it's supposed to be at 98%

1.0,dr_no,"Bond, without the silliness that would not only define, but marr, the series eventually. Dr. No is a brilliant spy thriller, and Connery is sensational in his first outing with the character that would make him a star."
1.0,dr_no,What a way to kick the franchise off with a bang!
1.0,dr_no,"The inaugural Bond film sets a lofty precedent for its successors, in its beautiful encapsulation of those key elements which constitute the classic spy's adventures."

1.0,dr_no,First movie. Nuff said.
1.0,dr_no,Dr. No is a fantastic way to start the Bond franchise! Sean Connery is a great Bond. Hands down.
1.0,dr_no,Easily one of the best Bond movies in the series. Connery portrays Bond almost perfectly but nothing like he did in Goldfinger or From Russia With Love. Has all of the elements a Bond movie should be.
1.0,dr_no,"Dr. No is one of the better Bond films. It has quite a few goofs and a relatively slow pace, but there is plenty of atmosphere, an intriguing plot, great action sequences, and fantastic set design. It also set the standard for the James Bond films to come."

1.0,dr_no,"Fantastic. Fun, gritty and action packed with just the right amount of acceptable camp. Sean Connery will always be the best Bond."
1.0,dr_no,The start of a legend! This was a more subtle Bond film. Not heavy on the action. It focused more on the mystery and introduced 007 as a character. Good film.
1.0,dr_no,"The first installment that launched the James Bond series to where it is now, Dr. No is a fresh start to the series."
1.0,dr_no,"Sean Connery excels as the suave British agent sent to Jamaica to investigate a murder case, on the way encountering tough locals, the CIA, beautiful girls and of course the iconic titular antagonist."

1.0,dr_no,"Classic stripped down Bond. Suave intelligent and sophisticated, stylishly executed by the young Sean Connery. Oh and let's not forget Ursula's sexy performance too. Inevitably certain scenes look dated but it's such a classic It really doesn't matter in the bond world."
