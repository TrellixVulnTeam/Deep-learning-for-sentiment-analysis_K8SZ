0.0,seymour_an_introduction,"The movie could have been reduced to a two minute bio to be played before Seymour receives some award no one cares about. I'm sure it's considered inspiring or heartwarming, but it was not worth making into a movie."
1.0,seymour_an_introduction,Beautiful just beautiful. Makes me love music even more. Bravo Seymour.
1.0,seymour_an_introduction,"Fabulous movie. What a great view into a true artist's life. It has always been extremely fascinating to me to understand what an artist has to go through to make it where they are. This is a great vision of how much goes into being classical pianists, as well as how they view life in general."
1.0,seymour_an_introduction,Inspiring! It made me want to start training martial arts again (live my life like an art form). I think that everyone will get something out of watching this movie. A lot of introspection = great film.

1.0,elaine_stritch_shoot_me_2013,"Not only a retrospective on the brilliant career of an icon, it's also a poignant and often painful reflection on aging, alcoholism and the life of a performer.

1.0,project_nim,El mejor documental del 2011
1.0,project_nim,A truly amazing and emotional documentary. Highly recommended.
1.0,project_nim,This is just about as good as a documentary gets. Wonderful and heart-breaking all at the same time. I often wonder if those who abuse animals in this life regress and come back as one of the animals they abused in their next incarnation?
1.0,project_nim,a very sad tale of animal abuse... Nim really only enjoyed the love and friendship of 3 human friends and had a number of human playmates and teachers assigned him. He really shouldn't have been raised and nurtured like a human child.
1.0,project_nim,The saddest and cruelest treatment to an animal!!! Humans are so cruel to everything!
1.0,project_nim,An excellent watch. Highly recommended for anyone who has an interest in how our society affects the world around it.
1.0,project_nim,"Amazing story of a chimp raised as a human and taught sign language to communicate, only to be abandoned later to live in a cage on a compound. Eventually Nim's quality of life improves, but the story remains sad. The footage of Nim's progress as a higher-intelligent chimp is fascinating."
1.0,project_nim,"One of the most heart breaking docs imaginable. If you have a pulse, you'll be moved to tears."
1.0,project_nim,"Touching story of a Chimp raised by Humans for research into whether they are capable of language. Along the way, We Humans let him down. Very interesting study, I shed a few tears for Nim. Great Study of Inter-Species relationships."
1.0,project_nim,Fascinating and heart-wrenching.
0.0,project_nim,It's a miracle I got through the movie and I love monkeys. It was more of a story about hippies than about the ape.

1.0,project_nim,"2011's finest Documentary, a gripping and emotional tale that needs to be heard and its simply criminal that it did not make the Academy Awards final list for best documentary feature!"
1.0,project_nim,"Coming face to face with a despicable reality, it shook me to my emotional core. The monstrosity of so-called humane experiments brought tears to my eyes. It clearly states out the message,"" Science can be damaging."" It really is a masterpiece."
1.0,project_nim,Simply stunning and amazing. Wow. What a story. Just speechless.
1.0,project_nim,"This movie from the director that made Man on a Wire is a must see movie about selfish individualism, greed, and the abuse of animals, in this case, those that look most like us and are our closest primate relatives."
1.0,project_nim,Fantastic. Must see.
1.0,project_nim,"Incredible, truly heartbreaking film.The awe and wonder at how similar chimps are to us, the arrogance an ignorance of assuming they are the same as us, and the awful tragedy of not taking responsibility for your actions.... You will learn as much about humans as you do chimps. Brilliant."
1.0,project_nim,"I cried during this movie, and I don't cry easily..."
0.0,project_nim,"""NIm"" feels like an encyclopedia shoved to your brain for 90 minutes. There is some interesting stuff, like how Nim drank and smoked, but the film is a bit repetitive at times in execution."
1.0,project_nim,Best movie I've seen in a long time. This story will stay with me for a long time!
1.0,project_nim,Fantastic..very very interesting...it will stir much discussion and thought!
1.0,project_nim,"Excellent documentary. The film is neutral, it just lays out the story of Nim, an ape raised as a human. The film is a gauntlet of emotions."

1.0,project_nim,Brilliant and heartwarming documentary about Nim the chimp
1.0,project_nim,Heart-touching documentary that shows the contrast between science and emotions in a very intense way. Marvelously edited the story comes in contact with your feelings since the very begining. I highly recommend this one.
1.0,project_nim,"Heartbreaking and beautifully told. Watch and learn, this is a true window into who we are. A punch in the gut for humans but well deserved. I opened a banana before the movie started and it was still in my hand at the end. Simply astonishing."

1.0,project_nim,I love to see this movie
1.0,project_nim,Thought provoking look at just how little we comprehend our relationship with the life forms that cohabit this planet. Heartbreaking. Bless his poor little soul!

1.0,project_nim,This is a heartbraking story and shows how cruel most people are. An amazing documentary.
0.0,project_nim,A movie about a bunch of selfish people who use a defenseless animal for there own selfish purpose. Then when the animal is no longer needed they toss it aside like a piece of garbage.
1.0,project_nim,This was a movie that kept me thinking about it for days/weeks after the first time I watched it. It moved me to the point where I'm now an active contributor to The Center for Great Apes and Mindy's Memory Primate Sanctuary. Everyone should see this amazing film!!
1.0,project_nim,Must see documentary! From the director who brought us Man on Wire. Enough said.
1.0,project_nim,"Haunting, heartbreaking, infuriating, unforgettable, and a MUST SEE. You will cry. Guaranteed."

1.0,project_nim,A great documentary that really shows how selfish the human race really is. sad...truly sad.
1.0,project_nim,One of the best doco's I have ever seen!
1.0,project_nim,The fact that this beautifully constructed documentary was snubbed by the Academy this year is a crime.
1.0,project_nim,Awesome. One of the better films of 2011. Marsh is up there with Errol Morris as an accomplished documentarian and storyteller.
1.0,project_nim,"I loved this documentary even when the people in it drove me insane. There are so many crazy people who were involved in the project that its mind boggling. The story has its funny parts, and its sad parts but in doing so it opens up to a ton of different issues and questions."
1.0,project_nim,An amazing documentary and one of last year's best films. Definately a roller coaster ride of emotions but well worth watching.
1.0,project_nim,Exceptional Documentary of Science - Humanity - Animistic

1.0,project_nim,A must see! Not often I say that :)
1.0,project_nim,"A truly exciting, inspiring, and heartbreaking story. Starting with heartbreak, taking us through an emotional roller coaster that at the end leaves you feeling helpless, cruel, and at the same time, inspired to change the world and the fates of such extraordinary animals."
1.0,project_nim,A great documentary about an extraordinary story and animal.
1.0,project_nim,An unmissable documentary that despicts human ignorance at the expense of animal rights! Heartbreakingand tragic...it you do not have an emotional reaction to this..you are made of granite!

1.0,project_nim,I dare you not to tear up.
1.0,project_nim,"SEE THIS MOVIE!!!! It's a tour de force of what we as humans are capable of doing without properly analyzing the consequences of our actions. And sadly, an innocent soul is at the center of all of it. Amazingly directed, James Marsh has crafted another masterpiece of a documentary"
1.0,project_nim,Very touching story. Thoroughly entertaining and heart breaking all at once.
1.0,project_nim,A perfect segue into Planet of the Apes. I'm surprised I liked it as much as I did.

1.0,project_nim,A wonderful film with a wonderful central character - as a species we really have a lot to answer for in the how we treat and think of other species - seen at 2011 Sydney Film festival
1.0,project_nim,"Deep, eerie film that makes you think not only about similarities and differences between humans and chimps, but about issues of family, of personality crisis and identity, and about human psychology. Entertaining and exceptionally good movie making."

0.0,the_last_waltz_1978,"Unfortunately I fell asleep, since I didn't recognize most of the music or the performers :("

1.0,the_last_waltz_1978,"Documentário filmado de maneira genial por Scorsese, que faz um dos melhores retratos do rock."
1.0,the_last_waltz_1978,"The greatest band movie ever - Scorsese's dive into the world of documentary's is highly influential, beautifully-filmed and sure to keep you entertained even if you aren't a fan of some of the amazing yet flawed talent on screen."

1.0,the_last_waltz_1978,Simply the greatest rock film ever made. Stunning performances all around.
1.0,the_last_waltz_1978,"It's a cliche to call The Last Waltz the greatest rock n roll concert film/documentary ever. It's also 100% true. If you can watch the whole film and not being emotionally moved by the music, especially near the end when Bob Dylan joins them to sing Forever Young, you may want to check your pulse."
1.0,the_last_waltz_1978,"A masterpiece of a concert documentary. A great way for old fans of The Band to say goodbye, and new fans to say hello. Only criticism is too much of Robbie Robertson. Oh...and Neil Diamond."
1.0,the_last_waltz_1978,"Simply said, the best Rock-n-Roll movie ever made."
1.0,the_last_waltz_1978,I could watch this movie once a week forever. great music.
1.0,the_last_waltz_1978,Probably a perfect concert film.

0.0,the_last_waltz_1978,I must have gotten a different blu-ray movie than the rest of these reviewers ... how do you shut up the Robbie Robertson - Scorsese banter and see the concert!? This is crap. Let me know when they re-release the full six hour concert footage sans the talk-a-thon. Long live Levon!
1.0,the_last_waltz_1978,"Eh if you don't like this, yer dumb."
1.0,the_last_waltz_1978,"Ranks among Don't Look Back, Gimmie Shelter, Monterey Pop and Stop Making Sense as one of the greatest and most important concert films / music documentaries ever made."
1.0,the_last_waltz_1978,This is how rock-umentaries should be made. Interesting subjects and honest interaction. Watch this now.
1.0,the_last_waltz_1978,"A showcase of some of the finest musical talent in, what was, a dying era."
1.0,the_last_waltz_1978,"One of the best! ""THIS FILM SHOULD BE PLAYED LOUD"""

1.0,the_last_waltz_1978,"Amazing line-up and great music, all shot in between some sometimes funny backstage stuff with Scorsese interviewing The Band. If you don't know who The Band are, then you might not enjoy this as much as I did... but, then again, it might provide a good introduction."
1.0,the_last_waltz_1978,"This is actually 1978 not 2002, was reissued in 02. Martin Scorcese's filming of one of the greatest concerts in history. Hardly a second of this isn't visual and musical gold."
1.0,the_last_waltz_1978,"No doubt about it, the best concert film/music doc ever made. I thought it couldn't get any better, and then Dylan appears on stage. Crystaline magic. For me, I thought Van the Man stole the show...and Muddy Waters wasn't half bad either!"
1.0,the_last_waltz_1978,loved it. Music was fantastic!

1.0,the_last_waltz_1978,show-biz has never been like this before or since.
1.0,the_last_waltz_1978,possibly the best concert film ever made
1.0,the_last_waltz_1978,Greatest rock doc ever made.
1.0,the_last_waltz_1978,"Along with Woodstock, The Last Waltz is the must see concert film. A great celebration of The Band that really give it all, who can forgett Levon Helm enthusiastic vocals and drumming. You must have it on 5.1 dolby for the ultimate concert experience."
1.0,the_last_waltz_1978,The Band + Bob Dylan + Neil Young + Joni Mitchell + Van Morrison + directed by Martin Scorsese = awesomeness.
1.0,the_last_waltz_1978,A great portrait of a legendary band. The lineup of this concert is even more loaded than anyone could ever dream of. My favorite segments are Bob Dylan and Neil Young's performances with the band respectively. If you love music (and aren't an idiot) you'll love this film.
1.0,the_last_waltz_1978,watch it please! one of the best concert documentary's ever... and maybe the only important one...
1.0,the_last_waltz_1978,Wonderful rockumentary of the last concert of The Band with some of the best musical artists of that time. If only Martin Scorsese hadn't needed to appear in it--looks like an evil troll.
1.0,the_last_waltz_1978,"As the cover says, it's The Greatest Rock N Roll Movie Ever. Team up the great American director ever, and one of the most prolific bands of the late 60s and 70s, and feature guest stars that nobody else could get, along with the great music and you have a perfect film."

1.0,the_last_waltz_1978,"The Winterland Arena farewell concert of the group that formed Bob Dylan's backup band during the ""basement tapes"" era, it's a gathering of stars from the last period in music that was founded on Chuck Berry basics. Probably the greatest documentary of a rock concert."

1.0,the_last_waltz_1978,"The Band's 1976 farewell concert, incredibly filmed by Scorcese and joined by a who's who of singer/songwriters from the era who all add something special. Will probably never be topped."

1.0,the_last_waltz_1978,"The crisp, flawless 'last waltz' of the Band, with the aid of some of the most influential musicians of their generation and captured by the brilliant minstrel himself, Scorsese, is among the finest pieces of musical doc cinema in existence, if not straight cinema in general."
1.0,the_last_waltz_1978,Incredible lineup of musicians for The Band's farewell concert. A must-see for classic rock fans!
1.0,the_last_waltz_1978,"Martin Scorsese directing, Bob Dylan, The Band, Muddy Waters, Joni Mitchell, Neil Young, Van Morrison, Eric Clapton, and more performing. I don't think I need to go much further in explaining why this movie mind blowing."

1.0,no_end_in_sight,Great movie for those who want to understand what went on in Iraq and who was responsible.
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"Required viewing for politically-attentive viewers, No End in Sight delivers a worthy report and digs up a lot of dirt on the choices that resulted in the chaos of Iraq."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,Absolutely amazing. What they expose is very frustrating and very hard to watch and listen to. It is a must see if you want a few answers. But just a few.
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"This film is as well crafted as it is cringe-inducing and infuriating. I wish there was a little more focus on Bush's initial manipulations to get us into Iraq, but that is a very minor quibble. This is an extremely important documentary that far too few in this nation will probably see."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"One of the most important documents of our time. Gets inside and understands how the Iraq War was conducted and how it was planned (or ill-planned, I should say). Absolutely fascinating."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,Such an important historical document that will great inform its audiences now and in the future. It also works as art - such a great film.
1.0,no_end_in_sight,It's getting harder to remember what it was like before.
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"I just thought I knew how fucked up the Iraq War was. 7,000 years worth of artifacts from some of the earliest civilizations were burned to the ground in Iraqi museums and our soldiers had explicit orders not to stop the looting. FUCK"
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"This is basically a fabulous hunk of info about the war for dummies. It is insightful, its HONEST, and I for one appreciate how the angle is compassionate for humans vs anger towards the government. Besides 'The cove' this has to be my favorite documentary ever."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"Ever wondered why there is still insurgency in Iraq even after 8 years, this movie answers the fundamental questions."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"Aside from the US govt's dubious reasons for going to war in Iraq, the resultant behaviour displayed by Rumsfeld, Wolfewitz, Rice, Bremer et al is nothing short of idiotic. It's frightening to think that so much power is held in the hands of such ignorant, vindictive self-righteous philistines."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,All this time I thought the Iraq war was a bad idea. Now I think it could have been good if idiots hadnt been running the show. Still teary eyed from the reality
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"Stunning hubris & incompetence of the postwar decisions, culminating into so much needless suffering, chaos. Film ends with my jaw on the floor and my soul filled with contempt for the war planners."

1.0,no_end_in_sight,"Wow, I didn't know any of this, enlightening. Possibly one of best Documentaries I've ever seen, and without doubt the best on the whole Iraq situation."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,No snark. Just facts.
1.0,no_end_in_sight,Want to now exactly how the Iraq War became a clusterfuck of epic proportions? This movie will take you by the hand through the quagmire from beginning to end.
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"This is the Iraq war. From start to..., well anyways. It details with candid facts the history of the war in Iraq by actual government officials who were there and involved in the whole process. We fucked up big time, and now there is no going back."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"A ""disturbing documentary"" that will move anyone who cares. A great look at gov't bureaucracy at its best. Tennis anyone?"
1.0,no_end_in_sight,Until I saw this movie I didn't really understand just how inept and indifferent the Bush administration was about the Iraq War. That ineptness and indifference have cost a civilization its heritage and hundreds of thousands of people their lives.
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"No End in Sight was very informative. To me, the overarching theme was that the United States government is not at all ""one"" thing. It has many heads and not every head knows what the others are doing."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,10/10 No End in Sight removes the conspiracy-mongering ideas and interviewees and uses credible sources and informants to formulate it's argument against American incompetence with handling the war in Iraq.
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"Wow. This is THE best documentary on the war in Iraq I've seen yet. Very educational and, more, very saddening."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"Let's you get a feel for the true reasons why the Iraq ""war"" was a quagmire-- They planned it to be at every step."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,Hopefully there will now be an end in sight.
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"It's hard to watch this and not cringe. Watching it last year would have been much worse, but at least a new administration may make this better. But most likely not."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"MUST SEE movie #2 of the year for all U.S. voters (Carrier series was the other). Reaffirms my old point that it matters less who you vote for but who you vote for will appoint. Appointed offices have scary power, as you will see."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"An absolutely incredible documentary detailing Post-War Iraq, and the gross incompetence of the Bush administration in dealing with it's occupation. The effects of which will be felt for many years to come.An absolute must see."

1.0,no_end_in_sight,A truely horrific documentary that really highlights the lack of planning and thought that went into the rebuilding of Iraq after the American invasion.

1.0,no_end_in_sight,A great documentary on the problems in Iraq and how bad decisions from a bad administration has only made it worse.
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"A real eye-opener, a must see film for all humanitarians. It really makes you question the motives of those in power as well as the reasons nations have for going to war. One of the best documentary films to come by in a long time. I highly recommend it."

1.0,no_end_in_sight,Truth shall set us free!
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"This movie is scary. You would think that of all the things that require careful planning, the rebuilding of country would get top priority. What you see in this movie is one of the biggest clusterfucks ever made. See it for the information."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,I wish this was fiction...
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"One of the most influential docs I have seen, ever. for me at least. For once a doc on this topic was put out with people who actually know what they are talking about. The interviews were great. The footage that was used in between interviews was amazing."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,All the idiots that voted for bushwad should have to sit and watch this.

1.0,no_end_in_sight,Excellent film that explains the origin of the quagmire in Iraq. The U.S. created it. Very illuminating of U.S. policy.
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"ferguson is my newest hero, alongside gibney. but as with the others, just a shame that the people who need to see this most won't, ie, bush supporters. also, like the others, it's a must-see."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,Explains so much on so many levels. What intrigued me the most about the film is symmatry between the elaborate obfuscation systems Bush concocted to cover up his utter lack of planning and the American corporate management styles now in vogue.
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"Great insight into the flawed decision making that escalated the war into what it is today. Commentary by military personnel involved in the initial phases of the war are especially effective. Whatever your political inclinations are, watch this film."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,It's simply and sadly the tale of things going from worse to incomprehensible.Grade: A
1.0,no_end_in_sight,Future generations will look back on this and wonder how our nation let these goons run our country for EIGHT YEARS (12 if you count the first Bush) without any recriminations. The damage will never be undone.

1.0,no_end_in_sight,"Even if half of this movie is true, it is a depressing yet insightful glimpse into the mistakes of the Iraqi war and how so many bad decisions can create the huge mess we are in now."

1.0,no_end_in_sight,Should be required viewing for everyone who is planning to vote in the fall.
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"AUGH. Our leaders are inept, ignorant and plainly evil. This movie shows why Iraq is such a clusterfuck, and why it didn't have to be."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"A very important bit of history laid down on tape for the archives. The sad thing is that we came so close to doing this right, but the wrong people were in charge. And those people are too scared to talk about it"

1.0,no_end_in_sight,Please watch this.It is so important.
1.0,no_end_in_sight,everyone should see this. Hubris getting in the way of common sense and ideology over expertise usually doesn't turn out well. Excellent view of what went on the last 8 years and provides a different view than the infotainment of Michael Moore..
1.0,no_end_in_sight,yes it is a biased but it shows that there were elements of American administration that wanted to do the right thing but were vetoed or ignored. History will not forgive us so easily and nor will the people of Iraq.
1.0,no_end_in_sight,Absolutely amazing. Very cool-headed in presenting information.
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"yeah, everyone and their mothers should see this movie. and it is not another bush-hating rant. this one places blame on many members of the administration."

See it.This film says, essentially, that the Iraq War and ensuing occupation is the worst mistake the US have ever made.It was a series of ideology, ignorance and stupidity that never should have happened."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,I have been disappointed with the mess in Iraq since early on. This movie did not help. Every American needs to watch this movie and act to make sure this never happens again.

1.0,no_end_in_sight,"Good movie to see if you want an update as to what is really happening in Iraq. You'd think that after all the other ""experience"" that the US has in the aftermath of war they would have learned something."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,If you only learn one thing let it be the word quagmire. This movie really let you see what was going on behind the scenes.
1.0,no_end_in_sight,The handling of Iraq after the fall of Baghdad is even worse than I thought possible.

1.0,no_end_in_sight,"If you think you understand why we're in Iraq and what the solution is, you haven't seen this film. The first non-sensationalist film about the war in iraq; do yourself a favor and see it."

1.0,no_end_in_sight,"Muy buena. Es muy clara, directa y provocadora."

1.0,no_end_in_sight,"As a lover of documentaries, this one definatley is at the top of the list. Personally, it had a tremendous effect and increased my feelings of doubt and the American goverment's recklessness in their politics, decision making, and use of military forces."

1.0,no_end_in_sight,A portrait of some of the lesser-known information leading to and maintaining the Iraq invasion. Watch this and you'll immediately be clear on how things have gone so wrong. Not surprisingly nominated for an Oscar.

1.0,no_end_in_sight,"The most comprehensive documentary on the ""War on Terror"" I've seen to date. Should be required viewing for every US citizen."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"A well-executed eye-opener. Bush and his cronies are dumb, dishonest, incompetent and immoral. They have done more harm to Iraq than Saddam has. They are no less worthy of his noose."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"We're (America) going to pay for our arrogance for a VERY long time. The last 8 years have been a complete embarrassment, a shambles and an epic lie. Definitely NOT a movie you want to see if you're a Bush kool-aid drinker (and thankfully there aren't too many of you around any more!)."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,Un documentario straordinariamente doloroso e vero.
1.0,no_end_in_sight,Everyone must see this documentary.

1.0,no_end_in_sight,"impressive film that is quite thought provoking, though i would love to hear what the commentators would propose as solutions to the current crisis"
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"This film is as well crafted as it is cringe-inducing and infuriating. I wish there was a little more focus on Bush's initial manipulations to get us into Iraq, but that is a very minor quibble. This is an extremely important documentary that far too few in this nation will probably see."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"""Quagmire? I don't do quagmires!"" My neck is sore from shaking my head in disbelief. Great film."

1.0,no_end_in_sight,"Please see this. Everyone. And, then remember this movie in November. Please."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,This documentary should be compulsory viewing for all newly elected leaders in the western world. If we don't know our history then we are doomed to repeat it.
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"This is a must-see for each and every American. It certainly clarified further on the blunder the Bush administration made in Iraq.After all of the money is added up, we would have spent/lost $1.9 trillion on this unnecessary and mismanaged war."

1.0,no_end_in_sight,Exelent movie that reveals what the war is really about
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"Every American citizen should watch this movie. Directed by Ferguson, a Brookings Fellow an political centrist. This movie examines the Iraq war from inception to present in a balanced and factual fashion. This film has an agenda - but it is not a partisan political one."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,This movie pisses me off!!! I am glad that there are people that see the Bush Administration to be no different than Hitler's Germany. Bush's America should be penitent. The entire Bush Administration should be arrested and maybe even executed for war-crimes.
0.0,no_end_in_sight,"Awful. The synopsis claims it's based on ""over 200 hours of footage."" That's exactly what it feels like. No End In Sight, indeed."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"This is a phenommenal documentary. It presents the invasion of Iraq through a number of different people's points of view, including people that were chosen to head programs for Iraq (i.e. Republicans).

1.0,no_end_in_sight,"Searing and powerful, this is by far the best documentary yet on the war and far and away the most powerful documentary of the year. To say what has already been said over and over about this film: You owe it to yourself and your country to see this."

1.0,no_end_in_sight,Holy Shit! Watch this NOW! It lays it all out.
1.0,no_end_in_sight,Easily one of the five most important movies I've ever seen. Incompetence or a decided course of action? War for profit makes me lean strongly towards the latter...

1.0,no_end_in_sight,Excellent documentary that is more about information than harshly going after the Bush Administration.

1.0,no_end_in_sight,"An extremely credible non-partisan documentary on the way the Iraq War was mishandled. If you still believe that the Bushies are anything but incompetents and war profiteers after watching this movie, then you are a qualified fool."
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"They didn't interview talking heads, here- these are the people who were involved. And what they have to say is freaking surreal."

1.0,no_end_in_sight,Fantastic doc with emphasis on the details surrounding the why and how of the insurgency in Iraq. It's amazing to see exactly how the whole thing was fumbled rather than just hearing blanket statements about the administration's incompetency.
1.0,no_end_in_sight,"Everyone needs to see this, this is astonishing.

1.0,deliver_us_from_evil,"I had heard about this film from seeing the trailer, and after I saw it. I was stunned. Deliver Us From Evil will change how you feel about religion from the inside to the outside. It is a hard film to watch. 5/5 A film that shows religion's bad side."

1.0,deliver_us_from_evil,The tortured anguish of Mr. Jyono is reason enough to see this film.The man responsible for preventing this from happening at the time - Cardinal Ratzinger. So like in Hollywood - you fail upwards in the Catholic Church. He is now Pope Benedict.

Oh the vatican and their cover ups, when will they ever learn. Great doc."
1.0,deliver_us_from_evil,"There's a difference between knowing about the (in)actions of the Catholic Church and seeing the detail, where the devil lives. This isn't a feelgood movie or an easy watch, and there's the usual documentary voyeurism over the tears and anger of the victims, but I reckon it needs to be seen."
1.0,deliver_us_from_evil,"A documentary showing pedophile cases inside the catholic church and how facts are covered up and minimized.

0.0,amy_2015,"Can't believe this received so many high ratings. The documentary makes it look like Amy was the victim in her own drug abuse and alcoholism when the choice was always hers. If I wasn't with my girlfriends family watching it, I would have shut it off after the opening credits."
1.0,amy_2015,"It only took me two hours to feel the same loving feeling for this beautiful disaster as if she were my own sister. She was a troubled soul simply yearning for paternal love; unfortunately the two people that should've given it to her (bf/dad) were the two most corrosive substances she ever ""used."""
1.0,amy_2015,"Absolutely tragic. A damaged soul being allowed, and more than not pushed, by the people who should love her the most to continue a self abusive road to basically suicide. Her parent and husband at the time should be ashamed and reap what they sowed."
1.0,amy_2015,Documentary really humanizes a truly gifted and one of a kind performer.. I hope people will think twice for making a troubled celebrity or anyone for that matter the butt of jokes and ridicule. Best music documentary in a long time if not ever

1.0,sicko,every american should watch this if they want too see what they are really missing

0.0,1174399-in_the_shadow_of_the_moon,"Weak. Utterly lacks the poetry and ambiguity of FOR ALL MANKIND, while not really containing any sort of scientific or technological interest either. Interviews with astronauts framed and filmed like bad new-age insurance commercials."

Humanity at its best.... one small step for a man....
1.0,1174399-in_the_shadow_of_the_moon,An excellent documentary. Accounts only from the Apollo crews. Neil Armstrong's apprearance was the best.

1.0,1174399-in_the_shadow_of_the_moon,"Extraordinary, touching documentary on the Apollo 11 moon landing. What sets this one apart is that it is actually told by the astronauts themselves. Plus, no film about the greatest moment in the 20th century ever gets old."

1.0,1174399-in_the_shadow_of_the_moon,"Contains footage that I've never seen before (like Deke showing Kennedy the Apollo capsule). Collins was a joy to hear, Bean's enthusiasm was contagious, Cernan's always so cool, and Buzz is the same ol' Buzz... it's brilliant!"

1.0,west_of_memphis,Wow. Gotta say this is a must see. The story behind the modern day witch hunt that was the now world famous West Memphis murder trial. The whole situation is mind boggling... just watch the movie and make up your own mind.

1.0,west_of_memphis,one of the most shocking and interesting docu-films I've seen...

1.0,west_of_memphis,It must be one of the best made and most important documentaries ever.
1.0,west_of_memphis,"didnt think they'd be able to top or do anything new since the Paraidse Lost series, but this really gives you a complete review/overlook on everything, plus their release and some really interesting details the last series failed to overlook.

1.0,king_of_kong,"A funny yet interesting documentary that only produces laughs, but actually produces some thought."
1.0,king_of_kong,One of the best documentary that i've ever seen.
1.0,king_of_kong,Amazing. These guys exist. Has there ever been a better movie villain than Billy Mitchell? He's like Zoolander but he's real. Amazing. The guy who talks about his fingerless martial arts gloves is unbelievably funny. I was in stitches. I actually love this film. Just AMAZING.
1.0,king_of_kong,This probably is the best documentary ever made and funniest tragic story ever told.
1.0,king_of_kong,This was such a great story. Billy was the perfect bad guy - it's funny to know there really are bad guys just like the ones in corny cartoons.Glad Steve kicked his butt in the end!PS am I the only one who thought Steve's wife was a bit of a bitch...(read more)?
1.0,king_of_kong,I never thought Donkey Kong was that great until I saw this movie.

1.0,king_of_kong,"One of the five best films I've ever seen. Billy Mitchell is awesome or the devil, I can't decide. A must see."
1.0,king_of_kong,"It's an insightful,funny and poignant descent into a eccentric,divisive subculture that turns out to be a hugely compelling and achingly human ode to the American dream and the people who chase it. It is also better than 99% of the crap that Hollywood puts out most of the time."
1.0,king_of_kong,More entertaining than you could ever imagine a documentary being. To the point where you start to wonder if it is all set up and everyone is an actor.
1.0,king_of_kong,"This movie is actually REALLY funny for a documentary, and is actually pretty fascinating. I was very impressed. Totally worth checking out if you love ""mockumentary"" style films, but the best part of this one is that it is a ""true"" documentary!"

1.0,king_of_kong,This is an outstanding movie. I really enjoy this film. There are plenty of funny moments and you really get to know the 2 main characters in the film. This film brings back a lot of memories of old video games. There are so many funny moments and the characters are fascinating.

1.0,king_of_kong,"A great movie!!! Good vs Evil, and an extremely compelling array of people make this a must-see.On a side note, we went to Funspot for the International Classic Gaming tournament during our Honeymoon. Sadly, No Steve Wiebe, Billy Mitchell, or Referee sightings."
1.0,king_of_kong,One of the funniest truly honest and best movies I have seen. It is like they made a video game Rocky with the two characters and people Billy Mitchel and Steve Webie. Also Brian Kuh is the biggest nerd of all time
1.0,king_of_kong,"The ultimate nerdy hero/villain story, an absolute masterpiece documentary."
1.0,king_of_kong,You really won't believe how watchable this documentary about a 80's arcade hit is! One of my favorites!
1.0,king_of_kong,Best Doc I've ever seen
1.0,king_of_kong,"This one actually is quite good and does a good job at drawing you in. By the end you will realize two things, professional gamers from the 80s are really dorky looking and Billy Mitchell is a dick!"
1.0,king_of_kong,you have to watch this
1.0,king_of_kong,"You would think this would end up being really stupid, but it's actually ridiculously compelling. It also exposes how cowardly some people can be over something so ridiculously minuscule."

1.0,king_of_kong,Billy Mitchell is a deuchebag.... the early 80's called and they want their hair back... ...steve wiebe is awesome!!! great show...anyone with Netflix should give it a watch

1.0,king_of_kong,Saw this after finding out the more crap south park eposoide was based on it. Plus big geek as well. Was brilliant and could not believe what a twat Billy mitcheal was. I think he cheated. Plus brain kuh. Worlds biggest dickhead
1.0,king_of_kong,One of the best movies I've seen - just terrific
1.0,king_of_kong,"Man on Wire was great, but if asked I would say this right here is the finest documentary I have ever seen. Perhaps my favorite film of the aughties."
1.0,king_of_kong,Steve Wiebe is SO my hero! Billy Mitchell can suck it!
1.0,king_of_kong,"had me asking myself ""what the actual fuck?"" many a time."
1.0,king_of_kong,The unlikeliest idea for a documentary (some adults try to break a record for Donkey Kong) turns out to be one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. To say I was riveted and hanging on the edge of my seat would be an understatement. Watch it!
1.0,king_of_kong,"Honestly, I happed upon this in the ""instantly watch"" section of Netflix. I LOVED it. Watch it, I'm serious. It's a regular ""rooting for the good guy""- type movie. Totally wasn't expecting to like it so much--"
1.0,king_of_kong,"It's amazing to see a collection of weird people at one place, and it made me laugh. It's just a game, but it's the game.... You need to see this!!! Anybody would love this documentary movie."
1.0,king_of_kong,I really enjoyed this. Some out in left field characters.
1.0,king_of_kong,Classic underdog story! Loved it & connected w/ it!
1.0,king_of_kong,Best documentary ever. Probably because it was so much fun. I command you to watch it.
1.0,king_of_kong,"This is one movie I could probably watch everyday and not get sick of. There is a great sense of good vs. ""evil"" with the underdog story played to perfection. Throw in some uber-geek cult followers and it's good times all around."
0.0,king_of_kong,oh god it was a horrible movie

1.0,king_of_kong,"Easily one of the best documentaries ever produced, complete with a kick ass 80s soundtrack."

1.0,king_of_kong,Not only a perfect documentary..but a perfect movie! WATCH THIS!
1.0,king_of_kong,"Riveting, hysterical, and surprisingly moving. All the elements of a classic good guy vs. bad guy three act drama fall into place so perfectly; it's almost out of Shakespeare. You will hate Billy Mitchell, who quite possibly is Satan incarnate."
1.0,king_of_kong,Biggest most unaware nerds ever it's freaking hilarious how self important everone in this movie really thinks they are... And a great bad guy to boot...Watch this doc one of the best I've seen...

1.0,king_of_kong,"This could be the most inspirational, well done documentary and story of human achievement I've ever seen. This guy is my hero!"
1.0,king_of_kong,"Who could have thought that playing Donkey Kong could be so riveting? The filmmakers do a fantastic job of eking out the drama in the nerd-filled world of classic arcading gaming, and its a fantastic journey of hopes, dreams, and DONKEY KONG!"

1.0,king_of_kong,"Must see, even if you don't like video games."
1.0,king_of_kong,"Amazing movie. At first I was blown away by the skill Billy had, but to see how he reacts when someone beats his score is absolutely pathetic. This documentary should be viewed by every video game fan."
1.0,king_of_kong,I saw this on Netflix recently. The so called champion is a complete egomaniac. You really want the underdog to win. Really cool documentary.
1.0,king_of_kong,"Being a massive video game fan, I loved this movie. However, I know people that have never touched a video game console in their life and in fact despise games who rate this film very highly. 100% rating for me!"
1.0,king_of_kong,"Best documentary of all time. Hilarious and quotable. ""There's a Donkey Kong kill screen coming up if anyone is interested."""
1.0,king_of_kong,"Awesome! The closest thing to ""The Wizard's"" final battle scene that we can get in real life. I freaking love everything about it. Billy Mitchell can bite it."
1.0,king_of_kong,"""Some say I'm being cocky. Some say I'm being lazy. I say, I'm being Billy Mitchell."""
1.0,king_of_kong,Great movie. Even if you don't like documentaries. Netflix this movie ( disc or stream )
1.0,king_of_kong,So much more than arcade games.
1.0,king_of_kong,"Gripping documentary about an honest suburban dad striving to legitimize his King Kong high score against a biased gaming association and the conniving, petulant record holder."

1.0,king_of_kong,Amazing film about human determination. For real yo
1.0,king_of_kong,"Good for Steve Wiebe! He's a brave, decent, and dedicated man. As for Billy Mitchelll...well..."

1.0,king_of_kong,"Best documentary I've seen since Anvil and/or American Movie.""That's how you play Donkey Kong!"""
1.0,king_of_kong,"A fantastic documentary with all the right angles: the sympathetic underdog, the little guy against a bigger (though not particularly big) and perhaps slightly corrupt organisation, suspicions of conspiracy, people with interesting obsessions and excitement in the moment. Don't miss this!"
1.0,king_of_kong,"Great Documentary, Sheds light on how much the supposed great 80's gamer Billy Mitchell is a cheat"
1.0,king_of_kong,nobody I make watch this film wants to at first but they all love it just the same

1.0,king_of_kong,Best characters ever.
1.0,king_of_kong,"I've never seen a documentary with such a perfectly crafted story. This is a must see, for anyone, even if you don't like video games. It's truly inspiring, and makes a classic high score seem like a bigger accomplishment than anything you'll ever do."
1.0,king_of_kong,outstanding. i love documentaries and this is one that can be enjoyed by fans of any genre. classic tale of good vs. evil and the obstacles that the good guy must overcome in order to take down the champion. a great look into one of the many realms of nerdworld.
1.0,king_of_kong,It's an excellent film with great moments and amazing story. Every single person is fun to watch and to listen talking about the game and the competition that surrounds it.
1.0,king_of_kong,"Less about the game itself than the community of the gaming world, King of Kong could make even those most uninterested in video games care about the survival of a chubby Italian plumber."
1.0,king_of_kong,Emotionally enthralling and utterly brilliant. Watch it and you will love it! I couldn't help shouting at the TV!
1.0,king_of_kong,it was Kool in a weird way
1.0,king_of_kong,"This is a brilliant doco! Just stummbled across it on Foxtel. You don't need to know a thing about video games to enjoy this story. It's a classic David & Goliath, Good vs Evil story & you couldn't make up characters like these!"
1.0,king_of_kong,"Holy crap, loved it! I love video games!!!"
1.0,king_of_kong,"One of the best documentaries I've ever seen, so enticing, real and intriguing. The story gets so deep and messed up OVER THE HIGH SCORE OF DONKEY KONG!!! You don't have to be an avid video gamer but if your into underdog and against the odd stories this is for you"
1.0,king_of_kong,I don't even like video games and I loved this movie. It was the classic tale of David versus Goliath. Everything about this film was enticing and addictive. Highly recommend.
1.0,king_of_kong,Billy Mitchell is a dick.

1.0,king_of_kong,"surprisingly interesting story! refreshingly fun to watch, steve weibe's uphill battle to be the best at donkey kong."
1.0,king_of_kong,One of the most entertaining documentaries I've seen!
1.0,king_of_kong,"If you can shift your reality to believe that video games are the way of life and success, then ""King of Kong"" may be the most important movie ever made. If you can't, then it is just one of the most entertainingly weird cinematic experiences to ever be documented."
1.0,king_of_kong,"A movie-documentary that you don't need to play video games to enjoy. A lovable hero and love-to-hate villain go barrel-to-barrel for Donkey Kong supremacy. It bends the truth a bit at times in order to make a better story, but it's a great underdog story either way."
1.0,king_of_kong,"Possibly one of my favorite documentaries of all time. Even if it were a mockumentary, it would still be awesome, but that it's all real makes it even more fantastic."
1.0,king_of_kong,"I don't care who you are and whether or not you play video games, this film will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very last frame."

1.0,king_of_kong,one of the best documentaries...EVER!
1.0,king_of_kong,"When I heard about this movie, I didn't think it'd be interesting at all. Little did I know, I'd be captivated. You couldn't make these characters up if you tried. Very entertaining and I found myself rooting for the underdog (as usual). Even if you're not a gamer, the story will grip you."
1.0,king_of_kong,"A true underdog story. You get caught in the characters, and is even more dramtic than some sports movies."
1.0,king_of_kong,Absolutely fucking brilliant. More mullets and virgins than a trailer park convent. The evil that lurks inside the gamer. Possibly the best film I've seen all year. Steve Wiebe you are my god!
1.0,king_of_kong,One of the greatest movie villains of all time can be found in Billy Mitchell.
1.0,king_of_kong,The best Donkey Kong movie ever made.

1.0,king_of_kong,One of the best films I've ever seen. Definitely the best documentary.
1.0,king_of_kong,Loved this so much. I really like how it follows a natural narrative and that these are real people being themselves. It's very funny and even though I'm not a gamer myself it was very entertaining. The facial expressions are priceless! Boo Billy Mitchell!
1.0,king_of_kong,"I have a new favorite movie...no exaggeration. I can't recommend this highly enough. Couldn't write a more inspirational script, and this is a true story. Call it The Karate Kid of the video game community."

1.0,marwencol,Pure and utter genius.

1.0,trouble_the_water,this one is truly worth watching!
1.0,trouble_the_water,"This was shot directly from a survivor's point of view. Actual footage of the hell people went through in 9th Ward when the levees broke and the days that followed. Yes, it angered me with the lack of assistance from all levels of government but this family was inspirational. Watch this movie!"
1.0,trouble_the_water,Everyone should see this movie.
1.0,trouble_the_water,Saw this film over the weekend. A reminder of the horror that was the response to the people in need in New Orleans August 2005.... and still they rise. Get ready to feel every emotion.

1.0,trouble_the_water,This is an incredible film. Devastating and uplifting at the same time.
1.0,trouble_the_water,Great movie. Made me ashamed to be in the US Navy. The government really dropped the ball on this one and one woman's video camera caught it all. Check this movie out immediately.
1.0,trouble_the_water,"Well deserved winner of Sundance 08 documentary. The hardships of the African American community in the 9th Ward and the incompetence of the US gov't in dealing with Katrina are vividly portrayed. Amazingly, the protagonists have turned their lives around and are an inspiration to others"
1.0,war_tapes,"Very good documentary. Very entertaining, very eye-opening, very thrilling, and maddening at times. It's very good to finally see what it was like to be a soldier during the Iraq war"
0.0,war_tapes,"I don't recommend this one. It's a difficult watch, and not very enlightening whatsoever."
1.0,war_tapes,You get attached and unattached quickly. Defending supply routes is part of war. Germans were forced to defend 7-thousand mile long supply routes while in Russia...imagine the details? This documentary is not shown by the future victors.
1.0,war_tapes,This is one of the best of the Iraq war docs to come out. it really brings the war home through the cameras of the soldiers. It also follows the soldiers as they return home and try to readjust to their lives as veterans. this is a great doc and a film every american needs to experience. High marks!
1.0,war_tapes,"An amazing film, shows what is really going on over in Iraq with out an agenda."
1.0,war_tapes,can't get much more real than that. Oh and if thats war Sign Me Up!

1.0,war_tapes,A great documentary and very true to life. I suggest it to anyone to watch and understand what U.S. soldiers deal with in Iraq. I thank these soldiers for taking the time to document their time in Iraq and sharring it with us.
1.0,war_tapes,"This is a gripping, although less than memorable, documentary. It's unfortunate so few younger people would take the time to watch it."
1.0,war_tapes,"Possibly the most compelling work made on the Iraq War, it defies any partisan criticism. It's neither an indictment of the war or an affirmation of it, even as its subjects openly express their thoughts and frustrations. Instead it offers a thorough portrait marked by striking ambiguity."
1.0,war_tapes,Humanizes the war in Iraq providing a refreshing antidote to the canned/tired abstract coverage of the war. Would highly recommend.
1.0,war_tapes,"this is an incredibly well put together documentary. not just for the amazing scenes, but for the soldiers' testimonies themselves which offer a wide range of political opinions. In the end, you get the idea: we need to end our current policies in Iraq."
1.0,war_tapes,"The soldiers' perspective on the Iraq War and the complicated repercussions for them and their families. Extremely graphic at points, but war is violent."
1.0,war_tapes,National Guard soldiers in Iraq with cameras... intense!

1.0,war_tapes,"I'm officially adding this to my list of ""Movies everyone should be forced to see"" list"
1.0,war_tapes,"The war in Iraq... AKA the war for cheese, is definitely all about money and oil and not for the security of the world. Its a great doco, must see!"
1.0,war_tapes,"I saw a screening of this in Burlington, VT. Excellent Q&A; with the executive producer after the showing. Watch it, and make your own judgements.Stop the madness...."
1.0,war_tapes,"My husband and his squad are in this movie about Iraq, he is on the front cover climbing the flag pole. I'm so proud of them."
1.0,war_tapes,this movie is an amazing account of the truth.
1.0,war_tapes,"This is the single best peice of coverage on the Iraq war that has ever been put out. And it is relatively unbiased because there is no voice over narration, just tapes made by the soldiers themselves."
1.0,war_tapes,Amazing Documentary! One of best I have ever seen.
1.0,war_tapes,A great documentary about a what soldiers face in Iraq from the perspective of the soldiers themselves.
1.0,war_tapes,I bought the DVD the first day it was out. These guys are true heroes. They've been through and seen shit that normal civilians can't even dream of. Out of my 300 or so DVD?s this is in my top 3. Best iraq documentary as of yet. Truly remarkable work.

1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,"HBO is free this weekend. A horror film of reality, Mea Maxima Culpa, should be seen by everyone. Kudos to Alex Gibney for giving 4 deaf men a voice and educating the public about 2000 years of cover-up."

1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,This is riveting. There is zero reason the Catholic church should be recognized as a state. Child molestation lead to the church's ultimate demise.
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,"Powerful and compelling, this is not a film to enjoy but one to be educated by, Gibney's film inspires an inherent sense of rage and shows that at the vein of everything, money, power and heinous people are always to be found. It is a film many will not watch but it's one we all should!"

1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,A stunning documentary. Proof that the devil does exist . He's alive and well in the Vatican. Thankfully God exists too. He's alive and well in the people who have come forward in the face of true horror to share their stories. Truly terrifying.
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,The corruption and disgrace that is the catholic church is no surprise in this film but keeping the guys from the deaf school at the centre of the film makes it so affecting and highlights the corporate evil of the organisation in a very personal way. A huge and moving piece of work.
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,"A look at the horrific way in which sex crimes are hidden in and the guilty protected by the catholic church, and a simply excellent documentary."

1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,Great documentary of the sad truth. The sad truth of the many cases of molested children by priests.

1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,"Un-real and Astounding, very sad and you can see the Church needs to do something. And oddly I wonder if the Pope stepped down recently, had anything to do with all this? ! If you watch the Documentary you will understand."
1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,Astonishing and scandalous documentary

1.0,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,Brilliant film. Hopefully we are seeing the tide has finally turned and the vatican and catholic church worldwide will no longer be able to deflect and resist fully admitting the systematic abuse and cover ups and realise these crimes must be treated as such.

1.0,the_invisible_war,"Shocking, sad, and it will ultimately make your angry and upset that women in the military can be treated so disrespectfully. Women who are raped by their superiors have no where to turn and cannot find justice. This should win best documentary of 2012....seriously."
1.0,the_invisible_war,"Sad, Anger, Disgusted, and Betrayal are the only things I felt after watching this. A must see, especially for those who are thinking about enlisting or already enlisted to be more aware."

1.0,the_invisible_war,Eye-opening documentary about rape in the military and a broken justice system that almost systematically protects the perpetrators and sometimes punishes the victims.
1.0,the_invisible_war,Infuriating and vital.
1.0,the_invisible_war,Documentary on the sexual harassment military
1.0,the_invisible_war,"it was sad to see the men and women in uniform breaking down when justice isn't delivered. It surely is a landmark documentary and will raise many questions on the subject of sexual assault and misuse of power . And by going for an appeal, the survivors have decided to fight the ""war"", excellent!!!!"
1.0,the_invisible_war,Glad to have been able to help bring a light on a terrible problem in our military.
1.0,the_invisible_war,"Truly sadden that the military feels ""rape is an occupational hazard to military service"""
1.0,the_invisible_war,Hard to watch but worth it.
1.0,the_invisible_war,Deserved to be watched!!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,the_invisible_war,heartbreaking and amazing doc.
1.0,the_invisible_war,Great investigative work.
1.0,the_invisible_war,"A critical issue. A must see film and a call to action to require every institution to ""weed out"" serial predators within their midst."
1.0,the_invisible_war,DAMNED IT THIS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE
1.0,the_invisible_war,Shocking documentary well shot and with some very brave people revealing their truths about their stories and the perpetrators deserving some civilian justice.
1.0,the_invisible_war,It's disgusting... Just knowing how many things our government and military will cover up...
1.0,the_invisible_war,"Any female who is concidering going into the armed services watch this movie,it just might save you from being raped worse yet good chance you'll be the one at fault....."
1.0,the_invisible_war,"Appalling, horrifying, and a must see for any member of the military (or police forces) everywhere."
1.0,the_invisible_war,Shocking and disturbing account of the epidemic of rape within the US military.
0.0,the_invisible_war,Women Don't Belong In The Military!
1.0,the_invisible_war,Opens your eyes to serious changes that need to be made. Disturbing on many levels.
1.0,the_invisible_war,"While I had always known that there were problems with rape and sexual harassment in the military, I was shocked at the extent of the problem and how little the leadership is doing to correct the problem. Hopefully, this is a first step in fixing the problem. This needs to be fixed now!"
1.0,the_invisible_war,Just the trailer makes me want to slap the military in the face
1.0,the_invisible_war,Will see it for sure this week or next in Santa Monica.
1.0,the_invisible_war,"Powerful film. Really unthinkable about the scope of this tragedy, and how easily the perpetrators get away with the crime. Hopefully with this film, more action will be taken to remove Commanders from the reporting / prosecution chain."
1.0,the_invisible_war,everyone needs to see this.
1.0,restrepo,Absolutely phenomenal. My words here will not do justice to the movie itself. Go see it.
1.0,restrepo,You need to watch this film.
1.0,restrepo,A truly unique experience. The film literally takes you into the trenches and into the minds of soldiers. The way war changes a man is disturbing to say the least. Scenes where soldiers laugh and cheer at tearing an enemy to shreds is justifiable but still disturbing and thought provoking.
1.0,restrepo,5 stars is all i can say!!!!!!! MUST SEE
1.0,restrepo,Amazing well documented insights inside a group of heroes in honor of Doc. Restrepo as well as the American soldiers fighting for their lives in the middle of Afghanistan's Koregnal Valley. Maybe the most satisfying of all the military documentary in years.
1.0,restrepo,An insightful and fresh look at the War in Afghanistan and its effect on our troops. Deep and worth the watch.
1.0,restrepo,Far and away the best war documentary ever made.
1.0,restrepo,"A harrowing, heartbreaking and important film. It wisely avoids political discussions about the war in Afghanistan, and instead focuses squarely on the brave young men who put it all on the line. I'm in awe of these men, as well as those whose stories aren't documented on film."
1.0,restrepo,"The realest war film I've seen. A great story and coverage of the deadliest post in the U.S. military, the Korengal Valley of Afghanistan."

1.0,restrepo,caught this on nat geo last night...
1.0,restrepo,"5 Stars, excellent documentary. Thank all the soldiers who fight for out country and freedom everyday. I couldn't imagine doing what they do."
1.0,restrepo,This documentary gets straight into it. The movie takes place in the insanely dangerous Korengal Valley. It's more of a follow-a-long for their 15-month deployment than trying to create any sort of linear narrative.
1.0,restrepo,great film got to see.
1.0,restrepo,"One of the best, if not the best, war documentary I have ever seen. Highly recommended!"
1.0,restrepo,Best movie I've ever seen in school
1.0,restrepo,"A must watch for the ""entitlement"" generation. Also, since Roger Moore feels the doc was lacking excitement, he should be immediately drafted and deployed to the front lines. Maybe he'll find some excitement there."
1.0,restrepo,I've watched plenty of documentaries on the war in Afghanistan and this one was surely the best.you really feel for these guys and this is a totally awesome documentary
1.0,restrepo,"There have been countless cinematic war movies in the past, but ""Restrepo"", though a documentary, contains elements that none have been able to achieve: Brutal and honest reality that reaches out to an audience that can fully relate."
1.0,restrepo,"Some films mark history for ever. This is one of them. It's moving, disturbing and definitly scary. But isn't what war really is ?"
1.0,restrepo,This was an awesome documentary. Shows you what our troops go thru. God Bless the USA.
1.0,restrepo,This is just one of those films that every American should watch. Afterwards you will have a much greater appreciation for how truly brave our soldiers are.

1.0,restrepo,Great movie. Good Documentary
1.0,restrepo,"Gripping. It's hard to even think of this as a ""movie"". It strikes me that, during the Vietnam War, this type of coverage was on the nightly news. No wonder there aren't comparable protests now: because we don't SEE it."
1.0,restrepo,you should see it...

1.0,restrepo,You just need to watch this
1.0,restrepo,The tension of The Hurt Locker only for real.
1.0,restrepo,Might be the single best military documentary of all time. This story is one you have to see to really understand the magnitude of war on Americans and others around them.
1.0,restrepo,Wow. This shows you the incredible hardship our soldiers face out in Afghanistan that we often never truly see. This film/documentary really immerses you in the harsh conditions our soldiers endure on a daily basis. Every American should watch this whether or not you support the war.
1.0,restrepo,"Wow. Amazing. Very intense, very honest look at what it's like ""over there"". The interviews with the involved soldiers really give you insight into the hearts and minds of these soldiers. No political bias, no spin, simply a great straight forward documentary."
1.0,restrepo,Every American must watch this film.
1.0,restrepo,"Yea, it's a documentary, but don't shy away from it 'cause you think it may be boring or verbose. Before you choose to watch another war movie, watch this first. It's a real account of what happens and delves into the emotional aspect of war's effects from the perspective of real lives."
1.0,restrepo,Excellent year long documentary with a Marine platoon in the Korengal Valley in Afghanistan. It's amazing what these volunteer heroes go through for us!!! WARNING: LAUNGUAGE IS VERY ROUGH
1.0,restrepo,"I've seen many movies and shows about war and have been been deeply affected by many scenes in them - but to see this documentary and to watch the raw, pure emotion in their eyes is both heartbreaking (one scene in particular) and uplifting."
1.0,restrepo,The best film I have seen to date depicting the trauma of war. It isn't bias. It just shows you what's actually happening out there. Highly recommended.
1.0,restrepo,"Life in the ""deadliest place on earth"". The director was killed last month in Lybia and of course Bin Laden, the man who arguably started this war, is now dead. Kinda makes this even more relevant. If you're an american you should see it."
1.0,restrepo,Great documentary...just see it.
1.0,restrepo,Excellent.Rollercoaster ride of emotion.
1.0,restrepo,"Embedded with the Second Platoon this documentary follows the brave men who, for 15 months, served in the most dangerous part of Afghanstan. A gripping and powerful documentary that gives just a glimpse of what these brave men went through and how it changed them."

1.0,restrepo,Everyone should watch this.
1.0,restrepo,"A film with no real pretense, other than to simply put you straight into the middle of the action and show you what really happens. To my admitted ignorance about combat, I have to confess it all feels terrifyingly real."
1.0,restrepo,"Just finished watching Restrepo. For those who are not familiar with the term ""1000 Yard Stare"" this movie gives an abundance of real life examples of how and why it occurs. A very different and exceptional documentary."
1.0,restrepo,Crude live war documentary....outstanding...
1.0,restrepo,Makes you support our troops but question the necessity for war at the same time. Very moving.

1.0,restrepo,"If this doesn't win Best Documentary Feature, then there's no point in even having the category. Not as graphic as it could have been, but it's still really heavy. As far as I know, those are real bullets being fired at real people. Not recommended for the squeamish."

1.0,restrepo,This is an excellent movie showing the lives of true American heroes.
1.0,restrepo,"It's scary, occasionally funny, powerful, but above all things, incredibly important. Staying politically neutral and simply telling the story of one year in the most dangerous valley in Afghanistan, this might be the best documentary of the year in a year of excellent documentaries."

1.0,restrepo,"it's an outstanding documentary, at times you feel like you're another member of the platoon fighting alongside them.The movie puts us so close to so much yet keeps its emotional distance as if to say, no matter how much we see,we'll never truly know."

1.0,restrepo,"I'd have given 6 stars. I still don't understand how can the cameraman literally stay with the army at the most dangerous place in the war for such a long time. The documentary is perfectly edited and you can feel the cruelty of war is not death, but the fear of death that haunts every single night."

1.0,restrepo,"If you enjoy war documentary's, then this film is for you. A peek inside the deployment of US soldiers in the Korengal Valley, The deadliest place on earth. This film gives you an inside look at some of the mental and physical challenges these soldiers face every day."

1.0,restrepo,Great look at the Afghan war. Everyone needs to watch this.
1.0,restrepo,"I'm usually not a huge documentary fan but this may be one of the best movies I've ever seen. It steers clear of the ""right or wrong"" arguement and is completely apolitical. It's just a look at what the young men of our country are doing while we're living our lives. Watch it."

1.0,citizenfour,It's rare to hate a film so much AND like it at the same time but that's what this 2014 documentary does for me. Ed Snowden just wants the world to know what the U.S. government is doing with regards to tracking people. Which reminds me. Hello NSA.
1.0,citizenfour,"Wow... I'd say this was probably the best thriller I've ever seen. And also probably the scariest one because this is, well, our lives. I never thought I could be so mesmerized by a group of people discussing in a hotel room. Damn it, Snowden!"

1.0,citizenfour,"If this be treason, then let us make the most of it."

1.0,citizenfour,"Terrifying, depressing and outstanding documentary, a must-see for all Americans."
1.0,citizenfour,fascinating and fucked up
1.0,citizenfour,"Amazing! This is a must watch movie! A documentary that looks like fiction. It's so polemical that hasn't been exhibited by the most famous cinema networks in Australia, for obvious reasons."
1.0,citizenfour,"Taut, revealing and suitably dramatic. The scale and the shock of the initial revelation and equally the lack of consequence of the revelation is troubling."
1.0,citizenfour,Great movie. Offers a interesting look and perspective on what happened during and after the Snowden leaks
1.0,citizenfour,Great documentary. Everybody should watch this. It's scary!

1.0,citizenfour,"Well paced, well edited, well done."
1.0,citizenfour,Chilling revelations that make conspiracy nut jobs look naÃ¯ve... Is this the true dark net? And where does it all end when the public seem ok with this level of privacy invasion and spy agencies continue without lawful oversight.
1.0,citizenfour,Chilling and absolutely fascinating. You will never look at technology and the government in the same way again. The moments with Snowden are especially compelling. It is interesting to see him as a person and not the political animal he has been made into by the media.
1.0,citizenfour,"This doc is so Despicable , So nasty , I can say is The best documentary I have seen in my life. How a man risk himself to Exposed a terrible side of what NSA is doing with our communication system , social networks, etc... Is Totally creapy. Snowden is a Hero , NOT A terrorist !"

1.0,citizenfour,Snowden is a true patriot and an advocate for privacy!
1.0,citizenfour,Stuff popcorn into your jaw fallen mouth during this doc that plays like a thriller. The story is as infuriating as it is captivating and puts a really human face on Snowden. The hardest part is understanding that this is not some absurd Hollywood fiction.
1.0,citizenfour,"This movie is one everyone should see but most will not see!Another reminder of where we are and how things have become more Orwellian than we care to know.Orwell wrote '1984' look it up.Or some quote about cats, kids and motherhood.. sorry didn't mean to distract u!10/10"

1.0,jodorowskys_dune,It is a great documentary and I wish they had made the movie. Jodorowsky did gather a fantastic team.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"After Reading Herbert's Dune I had to watch Jodorowsky's Dune and wow.. Most crazy thing to learn was that I 'saw' most of the artwork it inspired already, through the reading of the Metabarons & the Incal. What a great & inspiring man. i hope one day they'll make this movie, in some form."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Ain't it amusing that the documentary on Jodorowsky's potential DUNE was far better than the actual DUNE we got from a ball-clamped Lynch?
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,See great creative leader in action & where many iconic Sci-Fi came from.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Dune could have been awesome with this documentary showing on how this would have been a pioneer to all Science Fiction films! Truly incredible
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,This is a such a well-crafted and inspiring doc that I found profoundly heartbreaking and awe-inspiring. Watch it with your cinephile friends or even a date- you're gonna end up at an all-night diner drinking coffee and talking about it.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Fantastic, so disappointed this movie was never made."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,TRULY brilliant and inspiring.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Incredible and amazing! Anyone interested and loves films should watch this. A must-see. Dune must be made Jodorowsky's way.
0.0,jodorowskys_dune,I WATCH EVERYTHING! Kind of a historical conversation but very fabricated. The guy was claiming genius. It took an army to create Dune!
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,One of the best docs. I've seen in a while. The saddest part about this movie is that it made me think of Jodorowsky's age and that someday he'll die and I'll have to live the rest of my life without another one of his films.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,This may be one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. The stories of assembling of his team right down to the designs are so engaging and interesting. His Dune was really something special that never happened and actually this movie makes you admire him more as a film maker after watching it.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Oh what might have been! MÃ¶bius, Giger, Salvador DalÃ­, and Chris Foss. It would have been transformational. Instead we got that piece of excrement from David Fucking Lynch, the worst director in Hollywood history."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"I really felt for him, the joy and pain of creating. I love the Dune that is, and am intrigued by the Dune that could have been. I wonder what it would have inspired in me at 11, had I seen it instead."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Amazing! a great story about a passionate filmmaker.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Maybe we've not been prepared to see that picture yet. The story goes on.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Amazing documentary about the never completed movie project of one of the masters of surrealism and metaphysics-fiction. Jodoroswky far from being a master and a legend is an advanced soul never accepted or understood in the prostituted mainstream scene.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,An amazing glimpse into the unproduced vision of Alejandro Jodorowsky.
0.0,jodorowskys_dune,We just rented this documentary based on the high rating. It was extremely disapointing. We love documentaries however definately not this one. Boring interviews with boring people talking about how profound this movie making project is to them. Nothing happens so dont waste your time!

1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Najlepsie scifi ktore nikdy nebolo natocene
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,It was interesting to see how Jodorowsky envisioned a film version of Dune. I had read about how there was a fun being planned in Brian Herbert's biography of his father and this film shows the process and how close Jodorowsky was to completing the film and how it would have looked.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Must watch for sci-fi fans.Would have been an amazing film!
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Film as it is is definitely not a masterpiece, but to see this crazy person and his visions come alive is probably most inspiring piece of film I have seen"
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"I burst out in tears when I saw this, absolutely amazing documentary."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Wow. Would have been the best science fiction film ever! Learned so much about how ahead of his time Jodorowsky was and how everyone copied his work afterwards. Excellent documentary.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,brother in arms. forever dope.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,This will never be a movie and that depresses me.

1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Fellow Sci-Fi geeks, this is trippy and worth the watch."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,My favourite ever documentary. An absolutely spellbinding look into the creative genius and passion behind Jodorowsky's Dune. A truly remarkable and inspiring film.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Don't think it can be made as it would have been back then with that crazy bunch but i'd still wanna watch it if it does
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,La película perfecta es la que jamás logró hacerse.Los que chuparon de su creatividad para alimentar su propia creatividad.Tremendo artista Jodo.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"It doesn't only serve as a brilliant documentary about the greatest film never made, but also as a message to every ambitious filmmaker in the world and as a burst and reaction towards the extremely conservative nature of Hollywood. The world missed one of the greatest films ever."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Fantastic, please let him create a kickstarter, I wish so much that he would finally make it. He can have all of my money, just make it."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Proof that there is no limit to the imagination!
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"The story of an audacious, maddening, brilliant film that was never made. Jodorowsky will infect your mind with possibilities and you will never forget him."
0.0,jodorowskys_dune,Seriously? A documentary movie about a guy who thought about makin a revolutionary rehash of Dune. Who never made the freaking movie???? WTF really there's no movie?? I thought I was going to watch an awesome version of Dune.....Uhm horrible.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Jodorowsky's Dune is a fascinating examination of a maverick director's attempt to make his passion project - an adaptation of the classic sci-fi book Dune. Showing the creative process and the business side of moviemaking, it emphasizes the back and forth of crafting such an ambitious project."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Inspirational, funny, entertaining, and just an overall perfectly crafted documentary. I seriously wish Dune was made ugh."

1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Fantastic documentary of a grand vision that Hollywood wouldn't make. It gives you a lot to think about. The novel in my opinion was the best sci-fi book ever written. Jodorowsky's take would have been a sight to see.

1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"the best docu about the film you will never see,,, in this dimension at least!"
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,The failure of the Dune's project lead by Jodorowsky is just as big as his ambition with this project. Still today this movie remains a ground breaking movement in the Science Fiction movie genere. Even if it never came to be.This is by far the most inspiring documentary I have ever seen in my life.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"I hate what Hwood does to art and dreams.This must be made, one way or another."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,The story of the greatest film never made by an unsung genius. I will gush about this film and of Jodorowsky endlessly. We owe 30 years celebrated films to this man's passion and unrealized dreams.

1.0,jodorowskys_dune,What a brilliant man. I have mad respect for this guy!
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Few films dazzle and enthral with their ideas quite like this one. Jodorowsky's Dune offers an intriguing insight into a unique vision of the greatest sci-fi never filmed, made all the more captivating by the passion of Jodorowsky himself."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Gotta give this a full 5 stars, because this man's enthusiasm on every level... artistic, spiritual, life, etc. is so infectious... that alone is worth the price of admission."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Wow! What a visionary!!!
0.0,jodorowskys_dune,Weird does not begin to describe this. I have never been more thankful that David Lynch directed Dune rather than the tragic disaster this would have been.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Based on my Giger and O'Bannon's Alien obsessions, I had been somewhat aware of this failed film . What I was not aware of was how spectacular and insane, and unique it had been. One of the best studies of the human imagination you'll ever see."

1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Jodorowsky. What a guy! Fab documenrary about a movie that was (sadly) never made. Interesting and inspirational. You'll think about it long after you leave the theatre.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Fantastic to think what this group of artist luminaries could have produced with Frank Herbert's masterpiece. One thing that bothered me though, seems like half the people involved in the almost-making of this movie never read the book!"

0.0,weiner,And why would Anthony Weiner's wife be dragged into this documentary film....this what kills me
1.0,weiner,I simultaneously despise and adore this ridiculous man.
1.0,weiner,"It's fascinating how this guy got dragged through the coals for sexting, but other people brag about sexually assaulting women and we elect them president."
0.0,weiner,"Yeah! And Hillary's America gets a 4% from critics!, And an 88% from the people! hmmm"
1.0,weiner,This story is an eye opener into the lives of politicians. I cannot believe that the Weiners cooperated to the extent they did with the release of such a personal look into their marriage.
1.0,weiner,Eye-opening. Impartial. Train wreck. Watch it.
0.0,weiner,Horrible movie. Disappointed. Not sure why I spent the time to watch such a train wreck.
1.0,weiner,Wonderfully made. Raw and honest. Loved it.
0.0,weiner,"That fact that critics rate this pile of trash so high goes to show their elitist companionship with liberal lawmakers. This movie is as worthless as the child rapist Anthony Weiner, and his treasonous wife Huma Abedin (who should be in federal prison for her crimes against the United States)."
1.0,weiner,Amazing! Intimate moments. Dramatic story line. Captures poor Huma's torture and Anthony's creepy downward spiral perfectly. So affecting!
1.0,weiner,One of the most intriguing politcal documentaries I've ever seen. Weiner allowed his unsuccessful attempt for NYC mayor to be filmed. The question is why?
1.0,weiner,A wonderful train wreck.
1.0,weiner,"It's such a shame Anthony Weiner has this affliction regarding his penis and the Internet, as he's such a damn good politician."
1.0,weiner,"Cringeworthy EgoTense between husband & wifeMust watch, highly recommend it."
1.0,weiner,9 or 10/10 within the category of documentary. Subject matter was dull.
1.0,weiner,Insanely good like an episode of Curb or The Office.
1.0,weiner,"This is the most cringe worthy, hilarious documentary ever produced. I could not stop howling at Anthony ""Carlos Danger"" Weiner's creepyness."
0.0,weiner,"Did a fair job of capturing a horrible individual at his worst. Heard directly from the videographer - he considered the big Weiner a friend, someone he admired. There were places where ""punches"" were pulled... This could have been even more eye-opening..."
1.0,weiner,"Outstanding. Gripping portrait of Weiner and future Illuminati inductee Abedin. Shows a complete view of Weiner, I think, making him seem a compassionate figure in addition to a guy with a problem."
1.0,weiner,"Haha, what an unbelievable mess and a good show of populistic journalism."
0.0,weiner,"This guy is such an ego driven tool. For that matter, so is his brother (trust me on this). It must be because they are a bunch of Weiners. This movie doesn't even deserve a star based on who it is about. He is a pathological liar. So sad the smallest rating I can give is 1/2 star."
1.0,weiner,"Never seen a political documentary quite like it. Strange and fascinating. Like a car accident, you can't look away. Highly recommended."
1.0,weiner,Corruption at top of democratic party laid open.
1.0,weiner,Flawless documentary.
1.0,weiner,"Cringe worthy!! I love documentaries, and this was really interesting"
1.0,weiner,An absolutely shocking and riveting documentary! 4.8 out of 5 Stars!
1.0,weiner,"One of the best political documentaries ever. Weiner tells two stories: his improbable run for mayor, and the toll his d*** pics took on his family."
1.0,weiner,Fantastic documentary. Whichever way you may lean politically you can enjoy this. It really leaves it up to the viewer to decide how they view him at the end of it all.
1.0,weiner,"Weiner is absolutely one of the best documentary films I've ever seen this year. It's fast-paced, hilarious, and one of the most mind-blowing documentary films I've ever seen this year."
1.0,weiner,Truly amazing to watch this clueless man expose himself on film ... Never once showing any awareness of his deep rooted addiction to sex or his desire to seek help to better himself and provide some respect towards Huma. Oy vey !
1.0,weiner,"Not only would I watch this again, I'd vote for Weiner. Genuine, honest and flawed, Weiner cares about his causes and...his weiner. Only in America does that matter. Only in NYC, is it laughable."
1.0,weiner,An incredible movie that people should see. Unimaginable that Huma is the top adviser to Hillary. I guess she really is crooked! Scary that these are the people in power in our country. Must see.
1.0,weiner,"Go see this if you're interested in: NYC, political campaigns, the media, scandals, marriage, Anthony Weiner, or Huma Abedin. I was actually blown away (especially by Huma's presence) and it surely ranks with The War Room for fascinating insight into our systems."

1.0,room_237_2012,This made my blood run cold. Kubrik is a genius and this doc. is AMAZING.
0.0,room_237_2012,Not sure what cool-aid all of these critics are drinking but this was one of the worst displays of film making I have ever seen. Do yourself a favor and save your money. I made it through only thirty minutes and wished I could get my money back.
0.0,room_237_2012,Tedious trash I love the Shining but this documentary is about very dull people who have nothing better to do than over analyse everything. Emperors New Clothes style folk that bore people at parties awful

0.0,room_237_2012,Room 237 is like watching a conspiracy video on the weird side of youtube that never ends. It's pretentious bullshit and insulting to Stanley. The people in this film need to be institutionalized.
0.0,room_237_2012,I could just hear the black helicopters swarming my house as I watched this idiotic movie.
0.0,room_237_2012,"I read The Shining when the book first came out. It scared the living crap out of me. I loved it, except for the boring parts about the main character's problems. The movie sucks. And Room 237 is unbearable garbage."
0.0,room_237_2012,A joke. Good for a laugh. Some people can make themselves believe anything
0.0,room_237_2012,What a waste of time. Even 1hr. 42 min. is about an hour and 15 minutes too long.
0.0,room_237_2012,Over intellectual crap. The theories in this are a complete stretch and you never get to see the interviewee talking. It sounds like they're making it up as they go. Know that you will not get into Room 237 if you think Stanley Kubrick was human and possible of mistakes. Avoid this flick.
0.0,room_237_2012,The leaps made to support the films conclusions could be measured by miles not feet. Those few who believe we never landed on the moon or consider themselves 9/11 truthers will be most pleased with it.

0.0,room_237_2012,Claptrap of the highest order. People mistaking connections from coincidence. While the film maker misleads with so called 'facts' and out of context scenes.
0.0,room_237_2012,Was hoping for an interesting insight into The Shining and Kubrick's intentions behind the film. Turned out to be a bunch of Internet folk with too much time to spare deconstructing NOTHING to be something relevant. Was about as insightful as a post match interview with a footballer.
1.0,room_237_2012,The ravings of madmen in the face of staggering genius. A celebration of film's ability to stir the mind and a sly defense of the necessity of film scholarship. Absolutely riveting.

1.0,room_237_2012,"A stunning documentary about the deeper meanings of one of my favourite horror films. It shows you the political links, the subliminal imagery and much much more. You may never watch 'The Shining', or any of Stanley Kubrick's other movies, the same way again!"
0.0,room_237_2012,"Very disappointing doco about conspiracy theories surrounding the plot to Kubrick's The Shining. Its a wonder that the loonies featured here got anyone to listen to them in the first place. Who are these people? A complete waste of time, even for Kubrick completists."

1.0,hoop_dreams,"Probably best documentary ever made. Critiques the commoditization of young ball players without the shrill histronics one might attribute to this genre (ie. michael moore), but simply by humanizing them -a perspective we too rarely see."
1.0,hoop_dreams,"As a kid I watched this movie for the basketball, but once I got older I watched it because it is one of the best made films I have every seen.
