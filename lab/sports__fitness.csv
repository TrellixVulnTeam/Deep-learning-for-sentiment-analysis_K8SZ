0.0,invincible,"Football movies are an appeal to the inner-testosterone of every male that has ever played the sport. They are all the same and all lame. If you have a tad bit of doubt that this one is different, it's not."

0.0,invincible,A series of the same boring cliches you've seen a million times before. This movie should have come out in 1976 where it might have been fresh and new. The documentary on the DVD about Vince Papale was more interesting than the movie itself.

1.0,invincible,Great sports flick that anyone who loves football would enjoy. You find yourself rooting for Vince Papale from the beginning because not even his father thought he'd make it. Greg Kinnear had Vermeil hands down. Even movements and gestures. It was great!

1.0,hoop_dreams,"Probably best documentary ever made. Critiques the commoditization of young ball players without the shrill histronics one might attribute to this genre (ie. michael moore), but simply by humanizing them -a perspective we too rarely see."
1.0,hoop_dreams,"As a kid I watched this movie for the basketball, but once I got older I watched it because it is one of the best made films I have every seen.

1.0,invictus,Very very veeery good movie!!!
1.0,damned_united,"I've watched this movie over and over - it never gets old. Some parts of the story are inaccurate but make for good dramatic scenes within a larger, mostly true narrative. Michael Sheen is masterful and if you get the DVD the deleted scenes are a must watch as well!"
1.0,damned_united,"I fully understand why the Clough family disliked this, but it doesn't detract from the fact it's 1st class entertainment & I suspect Mr Sheens performance is closer the mark than we realise."
1.0,damned_united,"Sheen is exceptional at conveying the charisma, arrogance and downright pig-headedness of Clough. A great film and not just for football fans."
1.0,damned_united,Michael Sheen shines as Brian Clough and Timothy Spall acts as the perfect support. A very fun film.
1.0,damned_united,I don't like football and I don't like true stories but this movie is too...perfect.
1.0,damned_united,"Excellent performance's from the whole cast especially Michael Sheen and Timothy Spall, a well written script and strong direction. The Damned United is one of the best football movies I've seen"

1.0,damned_united,"Absolutely superb film, don't need to be into football but if you are that makes it even better. Sheen and supporting cast are all great, direction and the way its put together are spot on. Pure entertainment."

1.0,damned_united,"Very,Very,Very, Good Sports Drama"
1.0,damned_united,A truly unforgettable film! Sheen and Spall are both phenomenal in it not forgetting Jim Broadbent. The film follows Michael Sheen as the film focuses on his short reign at Leeds United and his great success at Derby County. Brilliant direction by Tom Hooper equals wonderful film!
1.0,damned_united,Amazing movie sheen is perfect!
1.0,damned_united,"""I'm Brian Clough...Brian Howard Clough"""
1.0,damned_united,Probably one of the best football movies I've ever seen
1.0,damned_united,An outstanding craft of a football manager movie. Wise arrangement of scenes to keep eyes of the audiences. Inspiring and goosebumping.

1.0,damned_united,Excellent. Don't really need to be a football fan to watch this. Sheen's portrayal of Brian Clough is simply brilliant and the supporting cast is top notch!
1.0,damned_united,"very, very good film, keeps football limited and shows that being a manager isnt all that easy."
1.0,damned_united,Just watched this film I thought it was excellent

1.0,damned_united,One of the greatest Sports movies of all time. One that deals with the failure of a legend rather than the pluckiness of an underdog.
1.0,damned_united,WOAH talk about the rise-fall-rise of Brian Clough!!! even though he only lasted 44 days in Leeds; he was an awesome manager!- especially for Derby. Peter Taylor was a great assistant too. Michael Sheen delivers a superb performance in this film.
1.0,damned_united,"The Damned United is really a tale of male camaraderie, sporting rivalry and the flawed nature of a man who many consider the greatest manager that England never had. A must see for any Derby, Leeds United or Nottingham Forest fan; or for any real English football fan for that matter."
1.0,damned_united,Best sporting movie I have seen in quite some time. Terrific acting in a tough role.
1.0,damned_united,The is the best football film ever michael sheen plays clough to the his best and acts like clough its brilliant!!!!

1.0,field_of_dreams,"This one continues to be a favorite of mine, more for baseball and the supporting cast than for Kevin Costner. I do like the overarching storyline, though, of Ray Kinsella's tenacity in fulfilling his dream, after actually listening to the voices in his head."
1.0,field_of_dreams,"If you love baseball or your father, this movie will bring tears to your eyes! A beautiful script and avery well acted, this movie will well be remembered for years to come!

1.0,goon,I don't usually like sports movies- but this one is really good.
1.0,goon,It is good enough to stand right next to Slapshot. That's how good this movie is. I laughed my ass off and so did my non-hockey liking friends.
1.0,goon,"Talk about a real guy movie, fighting, funny but a little bit to much of the F bomb. Pretty good movie."
1.0,goon,"If you like watching people get their asses kicked, this is a good one. I'm not much for sports movies but this one is solid. It's got heart. Plus I like Sean William Scott. He's got nice eyelashes."
0.0,goon,Rotten Tomatoes gave this 82% - it's time to delete this app and switch to imdb.
1.0,goon,"Loved this movie, laughed my ass off and nearly cried at the same time. Can't ask to be more entertained."
0.0,goon,This has to be the worst movie I have ever paid to watch. Horrendous storyline and sub - par acting. I thought this would be a new Slapshot but was massively let down. Don't even watch it on DVD.
1.0,goon,One of the greatest (if not the best) hockey movie out there!!!
1.0,goon,One of the best sports movie ever made

1.0,goon,Can't believe I haven't rated this.See it! Any red blooded Canadian will love this movie. Even green blooded will understand.
1.0,goon,Hilarious movie. Competes with Slapshot for the best hockey movie of all time. Hockey players will no doubt love the shit outta it!
0.0,goon,Jay should have written himself out of this script. Sean Williams Scott has done much better. Liev Schriber was the best written character in this script but that isn't saying much. This is no slapshot. Jay and Evan overdid it on the gay and Jewish jokes. Eugene Levy was slumming. Horrible ending!!!
1.0,goon,Hands down best hockey movie since Slap Shot

1.0,goon,Definitely one of the funniest sports comedies ever!
1.0,goon,One of the best sports movie ever made for adults
1.0,goon,"Thought it would be stupid at first, but, I was pleasently surprised. Theres a little bit of everything in this movie and that wasnt necisarilly a bad thing. Funny, simple, and you get to see hockey players knock the crud out of each other."

1.0,undefeated_2012,Excellent doc. A must see.
1.0,undefeated_2012,Fabulous Doumentary/Film which is very inspiring and realistic . Unlike a movie which tends to have a glossy finish this more of what we see in real life. It's amazing that coaches like that exist just for the sake of it with almost no personal gain.

1.0,undefeated_2012,This film is incredibly touching and inspiring. There wasn't a dry eye in the theater.
1.0,undefeated_2012,Must see inspirational movie

1.0,undefeated_2012,"Your move, Coach Taylor."
1.0,undefeated_2012,"The best sports doc since When We Were Kings! It's Hoop Dreams for football. If you played, coached, have a kid who plays, or just love football, you'll really like this film. Deserving of its Best Doc Oscar."

0.0,gunnin_for_that_1_spot,"What an embarrassment to the values of our nation, that these athletes who can not even speak English properly may possibly be emulated by youth throughout the country. I found the subject matter completely without interest."
1.0,king_of_kong,Absolutely hilarious!
1.0,king_of_kong,Who would know a documentary about the rivalry of two everyday men competing to be the world champion of Donkey Kong can be such an action-packed joyride into the little known competitive arena of arcade games?
1.0,king_of_kong,A film that shows that even outcasts can create outcasts if they don't fit the mold. Good vs. Evil in what would be one of the best sports docs of all time if it was about an actual sport.
1.0,king_of_kong,"An AMAZING documentary that shows the absolute cutthroatedness (I made up a word for this review) of competitive arcade gaming. If you have time to watch just one documentary, especially one about video games, watch this one. You will not regret it."

1.0,king_of_kong,Steve Wiebe is the man. Billy Mitchell is a douche.
1.0,king_of_kong,"Great food for thought on competition, and what constitutes a meaningful life. Plus, I was unexpectedly mesmerized watching people play video games for an hour and a half, which is a huge credit to the director."
1.0,king_of_kong,From the largely foreign little world of classic arcade gaming comes an underdog story everyone can get behind.
1.0,king_of_kong,An amazing documentary about arcades it shows just how much skill it actually takes to play these classic games and y we should never forget about those games
1.0,king_of_kong,Steve Wiebe for president!
1.0,king_of_kong,One of the best movies ever!
1.0,king_of_kong,"I wouldn't have thought that a documentary about Donkey Kong would be so interesting. But it's not about the game, it's all about the players. And by the way, Billy Mitchell is a bitch."

1.0,king_of_kong,great documentary on the video game world.
1.0,king_of_kong,The rocky of documentaries. Silly premise but it sucks you right in from the beginning. If you where ever a video game nerd you have to watch this.
1.0,king_of_kong,"This is an awesome documentary, which almost plays out like a rocky movie. Great insight into people who live in another world to us - who respect the old school games (perhaps a bit too much). I mean you don't known water to laugh or cry half the time. Gold."
1.0,king_of_kong,"Man, Billy Mitchell rules, and so does this doc.."
1.0,king_of_kong,Awesome doc about the golden age of arcades. These guys were REAL gamers compared to kids today. Their skill level is unmatched.

1.0,king_of_kong,This was fantastic. This is one of the best documentry films I have seen. It may not be about Iraq or Darfur but still a compelling tale. A true underdog story that plays out perfectly. Super.  2008 Movies: 40
1.0,king_of_kong,"I'm a nerd, so I love this film...that said, you don't have to be a nerd to love this film!"
1.0,king_of_kong,One of the best dramatic stories in either documentary or narrative.
1.0,king_of_kong,"Who would have guessed that a movie about video games could be so exciting? ""The King of Kong"" goes to show you that a combination of good heroes and villains is all it takes. Once you see it you'll want to gather up all your friends and watch it again. (Dvd, December 10, 2011)"
1.0,king_of_kong,"A funny yet interesting documentary that only produces laughs, but actually produces some thought."
1.0,king_of_kong,One of the best documentary that i've ever seen.
1.0,king_of_kong,Amazing. These guys exist. Has there ever been a better movie villain than Billy Mitchell? He's like Zoolander but he's real. Amazing. The guy who talks about his fingerless martial arts gloves is unbelievably funny. I was in stitches. I actually love this film. Just AMAZING.
1.0,king_of_kong,This probably is the best documentary ever made and funniest tragic story ever told.
1.0,king_of_kong,This was such a great story. Billy was the perfect bad guy - it's funny to know there really are bad guys just like the ones in corny cartoons.Glad Steve kicked his butt in the end!PS am I the only one who thought Steve's wife was a bit of a bitch...(read more)?
1.0,king_of_kong,I never thought Donkey Kong was that great until I saw this movie.
1.0,king_of_kong,I wasn't born in the Arcade but I personally know a thing or two about a gaming and it's rough outlook this though give's it justice with some good humor here and there.
1.0,king_of_kong,awesome documentary. it sets you into the world of golden-age arcade game competition. its hilarious to see how somebody can be such a douchebag but still totally nerdy like billy mitchell. this a great documentary about something most people know nothing about. i would recommend it to anybody.

1.0,king_of_kong,MONUMENTAL! una vez que la veas nunca verás a los videojuegos de la misma manera
1.0,king_of_kong,"One of the five best films I've ever seen. Billy Mitchell is awesome or the devil, I can't decide. A must see."
1.0,king_of_kong,"It's an insightful,funny and poignant descent into a eccentric,divisive subculture that turns out to be a hugely compelling and achingly human ode to the American dream and the people who chase it. It is also better than 99% of the crap that Hollywood puts out most of the time."
1.0,king_of_kong,More entertaining than you could ever imagine a documentary being. To the point where you start to wonder if it is all set up and everyone is an actor.
1.0,king_of_kong,"This movie is actually REALLY funny for a documentary, and is actually pretty fascinating. I was very impressed. Totally worth checking out if you love ""mockumentary"" style films, but the best part of this one is that it is a ""true"" documentary!"
1.0,king_of_kong,Best documentary I have seen in years. Even if you don't care about video game. You will enjoy the classic good VS evil story.

1.0,king_of_kong,I don't rush out to see documentaries. I have to be in the right mood for one. But this? Holy cow. I had to check the box twice while watching it. I swear I was watching something written by the guys who make The Office. It's hilarious. It's awesome. It's maddening. This is entertainment!
1.0,king_of_kong,"How is this movie so compelling? The subject is so trivial, and yet the story feels so epic, so good-vs-evil. Fantastic documentary work."

1.0,king_of_kong,This is an outstanding movie. I really enjoy this film. There are plenty of funny moments and you really get to know the 2 main characters in the film. This film brings back a lot of memories of old video games. There are so many funny moments and the characters are fascinating.
1.0,king_of_kong,Kiehtova ja hillitön pieni helmi. Viihteellisesti kerrottu. Paikoin täysin absurdi. Nörtit rulaa!
1.0,king_of_kong,I can't overstate how much I hope you see this film. You don't have to be a video game nerd to enjoy this documentary. All you need is an appreciation for weirdness and a belief that nice guys always win.
1.0,king_of_kong,The King of Kong is an insanely entertaining documentary filled with some of the most interesting nerds I've ever seen in a film. It caters to my every need as a filmgoer and I couldn't have been more pleased with it.

1.0,king_of_kong,"A great movie!!! Good vs Evil, and an extremely compelling array of people make this a must-see.On a side note, we went to Funspot for the International Classic Gaming tournament during our Honeymoon. Sadly, No Steve Wiebe, Billy Mitchell, or Referee sightings."
1.0,king_of_kong,One of the funniest truly honest and best movies I have seen. It is like they made a video game Rocky with the two characters and people Billy Mitchel and Steve Webie. Also Brian Kuh is the biggest nerd of all time
1.0,king_of_kong,"The ultimate nerdy hero/villain story, an absolute masterpiece documentary."
1.0,king_of_kong,You really won't believe how watchable this documentary about a 80's arcade hit is! One of my favorites!
1.0,king_of_kong,Best Doc I've ever seen
1.0,king_of_kong,"This one actually is quite good and does a good job at drawing you in. By the end you will realize two things, professional gamers from the 80s are really dorky looking and Billy Mitchell is a dick!"
1.0,king_of_kong,you have to watch this
1.0,king_of_kong,"You would think this would end up being really stupid, but it's actually ridiculously compelling. It also exposes how cowardly some people can be over something so ridiculously minuscule."
1.0,king_of_kong,I love how this was put together. Had to watch this for class and glad I did cause I really enjoyed this movie
1.0,king_of_kong,Billy Mitchell is a deuchebag.... the early 80's called and they want their hair back... ...steve wiebe is awesome!!! great show...anyone with Netflix should give it a watch

1.0,king_of_kong,One of the best movies I've seen - just terrific
1.0,king_of_kong,"Man on Wire was great, but if asked I would say this right here is the finest documentary I have ever seen. Perhaps my favorite film of the aughties."
1.0,king_of_kong,Steve Wiebe is SO my hero! Billy Mitchell can suck it!
1.0,king_of_kong,"had me asking myself ""what the actual fuck?"" many a time."
1.0,king_of_kong,The unlikeliest idea for a documentary (some adults try to break a record for Donkey Kong) turns out to be one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. To say I was riveted and hanging on the edge of my seat would be an understatement. Watch it!
1.0,king_of_kong,"Honestly, I happed upon this in the ""instantly watch"" section of Netflix. I LOVED it. Watch it, I'm serious. It's a regular ""rooting for the good guy""- type movie. Totally wasn't expecting to like it so much--"
1.0,king_of_kong,"It's amazing to see a collection of weird people at one place, and it made me laugh. It's just a game, but it's the game.... You need to see this!!! Anybody would love this documentary movie."
1.0,king_of_kong,I really enjoyed this. Some out in left field characters.
1.0,king_of_kong,Classic underdog story! Loved it & connected w/ it!
1.0,king_of_kong,Best documentary ever. Probably because it was so much fun. I command you to watch it.

1.0,king_of_kong,"Easily one of the best documentaries ever produced, complete with a kick ass 80s soundtrack."

1.0,king_of_kong,"If you have ever liked videogames at any point in your life, you will love this movie."
1.0,king_of_kong,Not only a perfect documentary..but a perfect movie! WATCH THIS!
1.0,king_of_kong,"Riveting, hysterical, and surprisingly moving. All the elements of a classic good guy vs. bad guy three act drama fall into place so perfectly; it's almost out of Shakespeare. You will hate Billy Mitchell, who quite possibly is Satan incarnate."
1.0,king_of_kong,Biggest most unaware nerds ever it's freaking hilarious how self important everone in this movie really thinks they are... And a great bad guy to boot...Watch this doc one of the best I've seen...

1.0,king_of_kong,"Who could have thought that playing Donkey Kong could be so riveting? The filmmakers do a fantastic job of eking out the drama in the nerd-filled world of classic arcading gaming, and its a fantastic journey of hopes, dreams, and DONKEY KONG!"

1.0,king_of_kong,"Must see, even if you don't like video games."
1.0,king_of_kong,"Amazing movie. At first I was blown away by the skill Billy had, but to see how he reacts when someone beats his score is absolutely pathetic. This documentary should be viewed by every video game fan."
1.0,king_of_kong,I saw this on Netflix recently. The so called champion is a complete egomaniac. You really want the underdog to win. Really cool documentary.
1.0,king_of_kong,"Being a massive video game fan, I loved this movie. However, I know people that have never touched a video game console in their life and in fact despise games who rate this film very highly. 100% rating for me!"
1.0,king_of_kong,"Best documentary of all time. Hilarious and quotable. ""There's a Donkey Kong kill screen coming up if anyone is interested."""
1.0,king_of_kong,"Awesome! The closest thing to ""The Wizard's"" final battle scene that we can get in real life. I freaking love everything about it. Billy Mitchell can bite it."
1.0,king_of_kong,"""Some say I'm being cocky. Some say I'm being lazy. I say, I'm being Billy Mitchell."""
1.0,king_of_kong,Great movie. Even if you don't like documentaries. Netflix this movie ( disc or stream )

1.0,king_of_kong,"Best documentary I've seen since Anvil and/or American Movie.""That's how you play Donkey Kong!"""
1.0,king_of_kong,"A fantastic documentary with all the right angles: the sympathetic underdog, the little guy against a bigger (though not particularly big) and perhaps slightly corrupt organisation, suspicions of conspiracy, people with interesting obsessions and excitement in the moment. Don't miss this!"
1.0,king_of_kong,"Great Documentary, Sheds light on how much the supposed great 80's gamer Billy Mitchell is a cheat"

1.0,king_of_kong,"I've never seen a documentary with such a perfectly crafted story. This is a must see, for anyone, even if you don't like video games. It's truly inspiring, and makes a classic high score seem like a bigger accomplishment than anything you'll ever do."
1.0,king_of_kong,outstanding. i love documentaries and this is one that can be enjoyed by fans of any genre. classic tale of good vs. evil and the obstacles that the good guy must overcome in order to take down the champion. a great look into one of the many realms of nerdworld.
1.0,king_of_kong,It's an excellent film with great moments and amazing story. Every single person is fun to watch and to listen talking about the game and the competition that surrounds it.
1.0,king_of_kong,"Less about the game itself than the community of the gaming world, King of Kong could make even those most uninterested in video games care about the survival of a chubby Italian plumber."

1.0,king_of_kong,"One of the best documentaries I've ever seen, so enticing, real and intriguing. The story gets so deep and messed up OVER THE HIGH SCORE OF DONKEY KONG!!! You don't have to be an avid video gamer but if your into underdog and against the odd stories this is for you"

1.0,king_of_kong,"If you can shift your reality to believe that video games are the way of life and success, then ""King of Kong"" may be the most important movie ever made. If you can't, then it is just one of the most entertainingly weird cinematic experiences to ever be documented."
1.0,king_of_kong,"A movie-documentary that you don't need to play video games to enjoy. A lovable hero and love-to-hate villain go barrel-to-barrel for Donkey Kong supremacy. It bends the truth a bit at times in order to make a better story, but it's a great underdog story either way."
1.0,king_of_kong,"Possibly one of my favorite documentaries of all time. Even if it were a mockumentary, it would still be awesome, but that it's all real makes it even more fantastic."

Very entertaining and I found myself rooting for the underdog (as usual). Even if you're not a gamer, the story will grip you."
1.0,king_of_kong,"A true underdog story. You get caught in the characters, and is even more dramtic than some sports movies."
1.0,king_of_kong,Absolutely fucking brilliant. More mullets and virgins than a trailer park convent. The evil that lurks inside the gamer. Possibly the best film I've seen all year. Steve Wiebe you are my god!
1.0,king_of_kong,One of the greatest movie villains of all time can be found in Billy Mitchell.

1.0,color_of_money,"The best pool hustler movie ever, with a smashing cast and great story, newman and cruise's best movie"
1.0,color_of_money,Great movie for all those that like the world of gambling and pool
1.0,color_of_money,For pool players this was a great movie.
1.0,color_of_money,Can't match The Hustler but a great sequel 25 years later. For those of you who hate the ending...you obviously haven't seen The Hustler. This was one of the best endings you will see. This movie has nothing to do with Tom Cruise's character. paul Newamn's only Oscar
1.0,color_of_money,I can;t believe Ebert only gave this movie 2 1/2 stars when it was released. Newman and Cruise are brilliant together and Scorsese perfectly captures a slice of american life that is rapidly disappearing. Watch out for an awesome cameo by the world's most underrated actor Forest Whitaker.
1.0,color_of_money,One of the best Tom Cruise movies. He is a young wise ass that hustles in pool. The plot twist is ridiculous in the end its a must see...
0.0,color_of_money,Pretty weak in my opinion...
0.0,color_of_money,the hustler ruined by shortar*e tom cruise

1.0,steep,Words are extra; go to see the movie!
1.0,steep,"""Steep"" was not at all what I was expecting. With the cast, I was pretty much expecting your typical ski-porn, and what I got was a great documentary. It was difficult to listen to doug Coombs' segments, knowing about his death last spring, but overall, I highly recommend this movie."

1.0,1017776-rocky,"THE underdog story clawing his way out of the hole by pure guts and heart. Every character fits perfectly resonating with anyone living life in the real world and dreaming of his/her faire-tale ending, even if its by way of a loss that never tasted more like a victory than here."

1.0,1017776-rocky,The one that started it all. Starts out slow but we get introduced to one of America's greatest known dysfunctional families that gives us all a reason root for a guy who keeps it all together with the one thing he can give. His heart and soul to a once great sport.
1.0,1017776-rocky,"Rocky epitomizes the underdog. We cheer for him, even though we know, and even he knows that he will lose. But it is not about winning or losing, it's about trying and giving it your all"

0.0,1093641-hurricane,If anyone really knew the actual facts and testimony in this case they would toss this garbage in the bin. Just ask one of his bashed up female defence lawyers and Bob Dylan.
1.0,1093641-hurricane,This is a fantastic movie. A sad story about a man who lost everything.
1.0,1093641-hurricane,Great film on many levels! Gotta love those on location Trenton scenes!

1.0,1093641-hurricane,"Touching movie. Shows how the legal system is flawed, although he was never on death row, i believe this is why the death penatly needs to be taken off, because people like Mr. Carter are innocent. although, the movie is excellent."
1.0,1093641-hurricane,que gran historia...
1.0,1093641-hurricane,Wonderfull movie about an individual who won't quit from the path he have chosen. Great soundtrack and song by Bob Dylan and great Denzel's performance.

1.0,1093641-hurricane,I just watched this again. I love true stories.Especially when they involve a few kind Canadians.
1.0,1093641-hurricane,An amazing film. All the more inspirational for the fact it was based on a true story. Carter may have been no angel but he definitely did not receive a fair trial.
1.0,1093641-hurricane,"Extremely superb! Really takes you in depth of Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter's journey through life with all his ups and downs. My hat is off for this man and movie. Very very well done"

1.0,1093641-hurricane,Loved it... an incredible story of courage and determination.
1.0,1093641-hurricane,"By far Denzel's best performance up there with Malcolm X. Why he didn't win an Oscar for this role just shows you an award doesn't really equate to someone's ""worth"" as an actor as hes still working and churning out good quality roles."
1.0,1093641-hurricane,DENZEL WASHTINGTONS BEST MOVIE EVER
1.0,1093641-hurricane,Denzel is the fuckin man

1.0,1093641-hurricane,Amazing true story of one of the best boxers in the world who never got a chance to prove himself as he was wrongly convicted for a crime he never committed. The American's robbed this man of his life and he could have been better than Ali.

1.0,1093641-hurricane,Awesome movie! seen it twice!
1.0,1093641-hurricane,Denzel deserved an academy for this performance. Hurricane is such a motivational story which teaches us all to build from within when others do not believe in you.
1.0,1093641-hurricane,"Denzel Won An Oscor for Training Day, but not for The Hurricane. How is that possible I ask. Hurricane is yet another film about hope and survival and this film should be an inspiration to us all"

1.0,fed_up_2014,"Excellent. If anyone does not like this movie, it's because they don't like the message. However, I call it child neglect/abuse with what is going on with our children today. Negligence because you do not know, abuse because you continue to close your eyes to the problem."

1.0,chariots_of_fire,Marvelous true account of British runners at the 1924 Olympics in Paris.

1.0,chariots_of_fire,"More than a sports movie, Chariots of Fire has a kick-ass soundtrack and tells a story of a overcoming adversity everywhere, whether it's class prejudice, establishment snobbery or just trying to win a race. One of my favorite movies of all time."

1.0,chariots_of_fire,"A true story of inspiring conviction in the face of adversity. Which is more important, your convictions or your dream? If your convictions are truly convictions, then the question is rhetorical. It's good to see a story where the compromise of convictions is not the reigning theme!"
1.0,chariots_of_fire,"This is hands down my favorite movie of all time. It meant absolutely nothing to me 5 years ago, but the contrast in competition between the different kinds of athletes id extremely powerful.

1.0,chariots_of_fire,"I loved the movie. This is the kind of movie that should be shown to young students in high school, that gives them a sense of motivation and direction in what they want to do. The portrayal of old-school Cambridge is nice.Overall: Definitely Recommended. Watch it with kids!"

0.0,playing_for_keeps_2012,This movie was okay but nothing great like the Note Book
0.0,playing_for_keeps_2012,Nothing special. The ending was typical and so was the entire plot for that matter. Only a mild twist on an overused generic romantic-comedy plot. I love Gerard Butler and I may have came to enjoyed this one more had it not been for Jessica Biel being his romantic interest.
1.0,playing_for_keeps_2012,I really enjoyed this movie...I liked the story line and the cast...it was a touching story...

1.0,stoked_the_rise_and_fall_of_gator,"This is not a shameless plug for a friend. Watching this, I couldn't help but think that David Maysels himself would make this film had he lived to do it. I will never let my boys skate, that's for sure."
1.0,stoked_the_rise_and_fall_of_gator,"Before I saw this movie I thought I was going to die. I thought Gator would come kill me in my sleep and steal my toenails from the garbage.

1.0,stoked_the_rise_and_fall_of_gator,The life of Skateboarder Mark Gator who ended up raping and murdering a girl and hiding her body in the california desert. The ending of this film is messed up how someone can be driven do such a thing.
1.0,stoked_the_rise_and_fall_of_gator,Awesome documentary even if your not a fan of skateboarding
1.0,the_armstrong_lie_2013,The disappointment and revulsion so subtly palpable in Alex Gibney's deep-voiced pastoral narration of Lance Armstrong's wrecked cycling career make for a thoroughly intriguing character study.

1.0,the_armstrong_lie_2013,"Lance Armstrong represents human beings at its peak, the highest point of success, he shows us the clouds and throws us hard into the deepest valleys of despair and disappointment. Armstrong is an outrageous; disgusting symbol of how far a human being can go to achieve their goals."
1.0,the_armstrong_lie_2013,Watching someone basically sink a dagger into your childhood fantasy is no easy sight. This was painful but at the same time so acutely produced and developed I enjoyed it.
1.0,the_armstrong_lie_2013,A fascinating and unvarnished look into the biggest fraud on 2 wheels.
