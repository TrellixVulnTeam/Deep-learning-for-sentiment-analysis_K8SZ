1.0,the_martian,Very. Entertaining and smart

1.0,the_martian,"THIS MOVIE WAS SO AWESOME I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT!!! There wasn't a part of it I didn't like. There's no strong language though, I don't know why that's in the rating. You haven't lived until you've seen The Martian."
1.0,the_martian,"Martian takes a funny, yet thrilling look at the perils of survival"
0.0,the_martian,"Although the visuals are well done, there is nothing surprising about this movie. You can tell early on how it's going to end, because it's so obviously fitting the common American triumph trope. I felt no suspense, and though acted well the main character has little depth. Meh."
0.0,the_martian,I enjoyed this movie but I hated the use of sarcastic humor and too much music which ruined the film for me. I like space movies to be serious. I would recommend it for kids but there was some really unnecessary profanity in the film. A dumb Hollywood movie.
1.0,the_martian,"Loved this movie, very funny"
1.0,the_martian,An absolutely great movie. It is so great that it is re-watchable
0.0,the_martian,"I don't understand. It's trying to be funny, right? Just no."

1.0,the_martian,"This is, without a doubt, Ridley Scott's best film. Funny yet very dramatic and suspenseful. Other than The Force Awakens, this is the best Sci-Fi movie of 2015."

1.0,the_martian,Best movie I've ever seen!
1.0,the_martian,"This movie had Drama, Comdia, Action and Suspense. Matt Damon performance as Mark Watney was absolutely perfect and supporting actors had a good performances also this movie deserves a Oscar."

1.0,the_martian,Matt Damon delivers in this scientifically accurate beauty of a movie.'Nuff said
1.0,the_martian,You have to see this one!
0.0,the_martian,Fun..Cliche'd..and too optimistic to a fault. High entertainment value...but lacks that surrealism that would make the movie a bit more compelling.
1.0,the_martian,"Well, it is one good movie, although some places are unreasonable. Like surviving a tornado that's thousands of Newtons, that it is inpossible to have a tornado on Mars because of the thin atmosphere"
1.0,the_martian,A brilliant film with incredible performances from Matt Damon and co.
1.0,the_martian,Fantastic movie. What sci-fi should be. Not since Contact have i seen such a smart sci-fi.
1.0,the_martian,"The Martian has made history, a movie that is supposed to be about a serious topic has been turned into a comedy quote show put on Matt Damon. The movie still offers the very realism of landing on Mars."

0.0,the_martian,"Pretty Boring, not really into space adventure, but I LOVED Gravity! Don't understand why this one was not that great. Boring, and way too much talking!

1.0,the_martian,"Matt Damon solo performance, He is Stunning and of course The Mars set is stunning too !"
1.0,the_martian,$11 and really solid.
1.0,the_martian,"The movie Scienced the shit out of Mars.This is what I'm talking about when I say ""science-fiction should use real science not."""
1.0,the_martian,This movie is epic. I have now seen it about 20 times and it gets better all the time. It has everything. Brilliant
1.0,the_martian,"Science nerds, ftw!!!"
1.0,the_martian,Matt Damon at his best with the same movie theme - being rescued. I love all the scientific/space jargon. It makes space more relatable to common folks like us.
0.0,the_martian,Laughable. The ability to suspend disbelief vanishes immediately and never returns. The acting is awful and the final scene where he's caught by the captain with a red ribbon is the ultimate disbelief. I'm sorry that 92% of you convinced me to order it up.
0.0,the_martian,Piece of crap. Matt Deamon is about as much fun as a woodlouse eating cornflake haha. Send me away from space!!

1.0,forbidden_planet,50s scifi at its best

1.0,her,5/5. I never thought I would be so emotionally invested in a love story between a man and a computer. Her is an emotional roller coaster and one of the best films of 2013.
1.0,her,What a beautiful movie. Unique. I've never seen anything like it and i loved the themes that her explores. All the characters were great and there were some amazing performances from Phoenix and Amy Adams.

1.0,her,One of the best movies of the new century so far.

1.0,her,A rare sensibility movie.
1.0,her,"A fantastic film that really makes you wonder, and draws the line of ""can we love something non-living, organic?"" With great performances by Joaquin Phoenix, Amy Adams, Scarlet Johansson, etc, it make this film one of the great lesser known films of 2013"
0.0,her,That was so boring and weird.

0.0,her,"This was a sick, weird, boring piece of crap. A real yawner."

0.0,her,"HATED it and walked out about 2/3 of the way through. Not into group cyber-sex in the pitch dark. I did not enjoy his personality, nor hers. The 2/3's I was creepy, but even worse. boring."

1.0,her,I loved this. It displayed how difficult it is to have a relationship when we really don't know who we are. The evolving AI was done so well and leaves us all questioning our own evolution. Well done - highly recommended for those that enjoy thinking about realities.
1.0,her,"A great take on artificial intelligence. A men falls in love with his operating system...if you think about it, not so far fetched.... A very layered, emotional and warm movie. A love poem starring just one person. Or two?"
1.0,her,Freakin' amazing. Not many films are like this one. Love story for modern society and a tale about how we become more disconnected from society with the advancement of technology and our fear to interact and love each other!

0.0,her,This was a waste of $2 from Redbox.
1.0,her,Absolutely beautiful.
1.0,her,Graceful and stylish; Jonze's sharp commentary about connectivity manages to turn its science fiction set-up into awareness about isolation. Her is a modern jewel that only promises to get better with time.
1.0,her,"Great show. Watched on AA137 DFW-HKG Aug 24, 2014. Joaquin Phoenix is great, and whichever German actress played the voice if the OS is seriously sexy, at least as far as her voice is concerned."

1.0,her,A love story beyond all sense of humanity... Make us to think how complex and deep are the human emotions.

1.0,her,Quietly stylish and thought provoking
1.0,her,one of the finest love stories on screen
1.0,her,I love this movie so much. I think this movie is similar to Lars and the real girl but better. This movie is touching and the soundtrack really fits well with the movie.
1.0,her,"This is one of my favorite films, and I know that audiences will either think it's silly or think it's beautiful. I'll say this. Give it thought that someone out there is willing to love something enough to have hope that it will love them back.Perfect film, smart, wonderful, loved every moment."
1.0,her,Absolutely loved this. An incredible examination of what it truly means to be in love. I give it the highest recommendation.
1.0,solaris_1976,M-F-O9.2[Andrei Tarkovsky]
1.0,solaris_1976,"A dauntingly complex and emotionally powerful study of grief and human emotion. While it may be quite different from Lem's book, Solaris still shines as perhaps Tarkovski's best movie.One of the greatest movies of all time."
1.0,solaris_1976,I'm still lost in space.
1.0,solaris_1976,"No, it's not 2001. But this is one hell of a movie. Starts out very slow, but when our protagonist arrives on the space station, things become tense. Tarkovsky reaches a level of profundity nearly unprecedented."
0.0,solaris_1976,Good luck staying awake.
1.0,solaris_1976,"Great Soviet sci-fi movie, one of the few actually. The philosophical tale clearly made as a response to Kubrick's 2001."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Majestical, beautiful and cerebral with dialogue that's uber-smart and poetical. I later learn this was Tarkovsky's LEAST favourite film. What a treat I am in for watching the rest of his ouevre."
1.0,solaris_1976,Such a Beautiful masterpiece filled with lost and grief. Easily my favorite Tarkovsky film.
1.0,solaris_1976,Una de mis pel√≠culas favoritas de toda la vida...

0.0,solaris_1976,"Based on Stanislaw Lem's novel, I don't understand the raves. Long and boring with no payoff. Stay away!"
0.0,solaris_1976,"Interesting concept, painfully dull."
1.0,solaris_1976,Director Andrei Tarkovsky utilizes the medium of science-fiction to pose profound questions about mankind and the meaning of life. The result is a chilling and thoughtful motion picture.
1.0,solaris_1976,"Painfully slow as it may be, Solyaris uses this meditative pace to deliver a hypnotic and innovative film experience."
1.0,solaris_1976,"A masterful exploration of loss and guilt that leaves Hollywood attempts in the dust, an argument could be made that 'Solaris' surpasses even Kubrick's '2001' in the science fiction genre. A close contender for my favourite film of all time."
1.0,solaris_1976,Mindbending! It will trick your mind till the very end
1.0,solaris_1976,"Tarkovsky's Solaris is a mysterious, ambient film with philosophy and psychology to spare. The sets are elaborate and the final moments encapsulate a sense of disbelief and consciousness at the same time. A truly excellent sci-fi (if it can be called that)."
1.0,solaris_1976,"This review is for the Russian, 1972, version...An absolutely beautiful film - intellectually and aesthetically - SOME holes in the storytelling, but mostly due to the nature of the surrealism of the narrative. Highly recommended; and, one of my new favorites..."
1.0,solaris_1976,Andrei Tarkovsky's brilliant reworking of the Stanislaw Lem novel about cosmonauts faced with a strange alien intelligence that communicates using recreations of people from their memories. Fascinating film; eerily introspective and compelling.
1.0,solaris_1976,"""Don't turn a scientific problem into a common love story""."
1.0,solaris_1976,This is my favourite movie of all time. But please can the date be corrected in RT? It is 1972 not 1976.
1.0,solaris_1976,"La respuesta Rusa a 2001 de Kubrick....si, tan viajado como suena."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Really a masterpiece, with outstanding photography."
1.0,solaris_1976,"What it is to be human. What it is to be in love. What it is to be stuck having to choose between the two. Memories, reflections, regrets, infinity. Mind blowing, and absolutely hypnotic."
1.0,solaris_1976,"This haunting reply to Kubrick's ""2001"" perhaps surpasses it."
1.0,solaris_1976,Better than '2001'? Quite possibly.
1.0,solaris_1976,This is not a film but a visual poem about love and humanity.
1.0,solaris_1976,"The greatest science fiction film I have ever seen, and one of my all-time top 3. In fact, Ran is its only competition for my favorite movie."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Quanto mais tentamos procurar vida al√©m do nosso planeta, mais nos perguntamos sobre a nossa exist√™ncia."
1.0,solaris_1976,What can I say? It is visually incredible. The themes leave you thinking for days. The cinematography and the editing are daunting. This film is irresistible to me on so many levels. Truly one of the greatest Science Fiction films of all time.
1.0,solaris_1976,"It's a lot more punishing than most sci-fi film, but that's because Tarkovsky creates such rigid characters to match his settings."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Absolutely incredible. Upon watching this for the first time, it instantly became my new favorite film of all time."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Beautiful, quite possibly the best science fiction film ever."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Watch this along with Stalker, another masterpiece. Questions the nature of consciousness and reality in a thoughtful, intelligent way. Better by far than the remake. This film can be difficult to locate."
1.0,solaris_1976,"I saw this in the theatre when I was little. I had no idea what was going on, but I loved it anyways. By the time I saw it again, in my late 20s, I had read the book several times, and found the film even better than I remembered. (And THEN I found out that Tarkovsky's other movies are even better!)"
1.0,solaris_1976,brilliant! absolutely mesmerizing!
0.0,solaris_1976,hated this movie. Russian stuff is SO SLOW. Minutes 5-15 or so were the only interesting part of the whole film.
0.0,solaris_1976,Appallingly slow paced. Not a good sign when you could easily have cut the first 50 minutes of the film. Semi-experimental in style. Muddled in thematic & philosophical intents. Not a good adaptation of what is a great novel.
1.0,solaris_1976,A Sy Fy master piece and a reflection about human nature...
1.0,solaris_1976,"brilliant, unforgetable,"
1.0,solaris_1976,Whilst others may talk of Star Wars or Bladerunner (taking nothing away from them) this movie is stunning in its revelation that essentially all stories are about a man and his inner universe..simply perfect

1.0,solaris_1976,Possibly the best Sci-Fi movie ever made.

1.0,solaris_1976,"My favorite foreign film, this sci-fi movie almost becomes a horror, showing the pains of not being able to let go of the ones you love. Visually it is a treat, especialy in the opening scene. It really makes you think, especially after the fantastic ending."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Despite not quite a faithful adaptation of Stanislaw Lem`s novel, Tarkovsky`s film remains a sci-fi masterpiece!"
1.0,solaris_1976,A low key philosophical sci-fi masterpiece.

1.0,solaris_1976,"It's late and there's nothing I can say after a single viewing that will do justice to how this film affected me, so I'll only say that I'm ashamed that it's taken me this long to fill this particular gaping hole in the realm of my film viewing experience."
1.0,solaris_1976,"This movie is haunting. Not because it's very scary, but there's something about the atmosphere. And also the Ocean. It's a very slow moving film, but it really pulled me in. This one's going to take many viewings."
1.0,solaris_1976,A classic. Must see for movie-lovers. This film is so much bigger than sci-fi.
1.0,solaris_1976,Don't waste your time on the US remake with George Clooney This is the version you should see.
1.0,solaris_1976,A mediative and engaging film. Completely unlike any other movie I have seen.
1.0,solaris_1976,Awesome achingly beautiful film

1.0,solaris_1976,Tarkovsky not for everyone.. but this good
1.0,solaris_1976,An excellent psychodrama. The best science fiction film I have seen in years.
1.0,solaris_1976,The outer reaches of within.
1.0,solaris_1976,This is very philosophy science fiction. Earth for Solaris makes person's mind an embodiment.Why did he have wanted to make such a movie? Steven Soderbergh directed an American adaptation of Solaris in 2002. But ending is different.
1.0,solaris_1976,"Beautiful meditation on love and the divine. When asked to choose between Camus's hopeless happiness and Dostoevsky's depressing hope, Tarkovsky keeps you guessing. Of course, it's difficult to analyze the film in words, and I think that's the point."
1.0,solaris_1976,"I laughed , I cried , It was a masterpiece"

1.0,solaris_1976,"Brilliant and incredible. A beautiful, compelling science-fiction epic that has yet to be matched...one of the greatest of all time."
1.0,solaris_1976,January 2010 - It is alwasy hard to explain poetry and how it affects us. The images and the words in Solaris are of the same nature. You don't need a logic or straight story but you feel it and you cannot ignore its attraction.
1.0,solaris_1976,"Mesmerizing cinematography, symbolism and a timeless feel cement this film amongst best in the science fiction genre. Tarkovsky√¢??s shots in space are just as graceful as his panning shots of the Earthly beauty. The film commanded my full attention from the first frame."

1.0,solaris_1976,Andrei Tarkovsky is simply one of the greatest directors of all time.
1.0,solaris_1976,It's my favorite sci fi movie. Intense in it's use of emotions AND philosophical insight. For a near 3 hour movie it flows beautifully and it describes human nature better than any other sci fi movie can.
1.0,solaris_1976,"Stanislaw Lem's philosophical meditation on ""inner space"" in ""outer space"", brought to the screen by Tarkovsky. It's a long slow but the performance's are so good and some of the imagery staggering so that once accustomed to it's slow pacing it has a hypnotic hold."

1.0,solaris_1976,"Moving and thought provoking sci-fi. See the remake *after* the original, and you'll agree it stinks :)"
1.0,solaris_1976,This is Solaris. Unique. Tarkovsky 100%. See Stalker and you acquire the taste.
1.0,solaris_1976,"I like this the most out of Tarkovsky's movies (Stalker comes close behind, though). Beautiful, serene and ""psychological""."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Sure, it's long and boring, but it's also very rewarding."
0.0,solaris_1976,more like SNORE-ARIS. Ugh. If I wouldn't have been in The Paramount I would have just turned it off.
1.0,solaris_1976,Tarkovskys excellent movie!Have not seen the american version.
1.0,solaris_1976,"Tarkovsky captures the ineffable. Certain moments approach a cinematic apotheosis in terms of psychological depth as well as technical mastery. His command of the medium here is still without parallel today, almost forty years later."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Loaded with beautiful shots. A contemplative, thought-provoking film that poses many probing existentialist queries."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Subtle, beautiful, evocative, haunting... definitely ranks among the top 10 in my vast Sci-Fi movie collection. Not for everyone, mind you - no Lucas-esque space battles here - but very rewarding for those with patience and a questioning mind."
1.0,solaris_1976,Just watched this a second time and blew my mind. One of the greatest and thoughtful sci-fi films.
1.0,solaris_1976,A surreal treat from the USSR. Especially the driving scene in Tokyo.
1.0,solaris_1976,My favourite movie of all time. Never tire of this chilling and moody masterpiece of modern Cinema. Tarkovsky's finest hour (though he would argue with me if he were still alive!)
1.0,solaris_1976,"Fuck people who don't like Tarkovsky, fuck everyone who calls his films tedious and, most importantly, fuck the remake of this movie. There, I vented."
1.0,solaris_1976,Una inquietante respuesta a la odisea de Kubrick. El final es memorable.
1.0,solaris_1976,"Despreciada por los cr√É¬≠ticos de Tarkokski *que la consideran una pel√É¬≠cula menor dentro de su filmograf√É¬≠a, Solaris me parece una pel√É¬≠cula bell√É¬≠sima, una muy digna adaptaci√É¬≥n del libro de Stanislaw Lem."
1.0,solaris_1976,"It's not the size that matters, it's the motion of the ocean..."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Strap yourself in for some exquisite and intelligent and mature film making. Some hate its languid pace, but for me it captures the essence of what the film is all about - subtle exploration of inner space, rather than the usual sterile plot or action driven movie. Unforgettable classic.."
1.0,solaris_1976,Beautiful and stylish! Fucking LONG.
1.0,solaris_1976,"I like the way that the story has little drama but makes you feel uneasy watching it, where the idea of having your past, your stilted thoughts return fascinating. Yet, this was one of the most hardest films for me to watch and my least favourite by Tarkovsky."
1.0,solaris_1976,"yes, this is a long, slow film. but in my opinion, every minute of it is masterful. would easily be in my top 5 if not for the fact that all tarkovsky films are near perfect: choosing my favorite is like choosing a favorite child....its morally wrong."
1.0,solaris_1976,Way better than the remake. An enthralling Sci-fi journey with a psychological twist. Very surreal camera work.
1.0,solaris_1976,"This movie, although very slow and not a real sci-fi movie like we are used to know, is superb. The ""crazy"" talks in a space-can with rooms llike an old caste. The incredible love story between a real and a ""dream"""
1.0,solaris_1976,"Encountering ""The Unknown"" one has to face a fifth colony - his soul...Outstanding movie, quite outstanding!!!"
1.0,solaris_1976,Andrei Tarkovsky is simply one of the greatest directors of all time.

1.0,solaris_1976,Atmosphere is all you need. Great acting. Beautiful shots.
1.0,solaris_1976,"Hypnotic, amazing movie. Long? Sure! Arty? You bet!"
1.0,solaris_1976,Excellent plot. Outstanding photography.
1.0,solaris_1976,A slow and somber dissection of the human condition of loneliness in a very off put and obscure manner. It's a very frightening movie because it's so out there yet it hits you regardless with what Tarkovsky is trying to say.
1.0,solaris_1976,one of the best movies I have see in my life
1.0,solaris_1976,"""Solaris"" is considered the Soviet response to Kubrick's ""2001"", and is in many ways a better film. Many science fiction stories open with a mystery and conclude with an answer. ""Solaris"" only leaves us with more questions, but provides a new way of thinking about issues that we don't understand."
1.0,solaris_1976,"loved it, stayed in my mind for a long time"
1.0,solaris_1976,Un trance espectacular de m√°s de dos o tres horas de duraci√≥n.
1.0,solaris_1976,"5 OMG's. Just bought the Criterion Collection version, and it's much better than the Ruscico."
1.0,solaris_1976,"A trip inside of the soul, and what it means to have a memory of love in space and time. It also presents the future as cira 1972 Tokyo roadways! Great, great imagery, if not Tarkovsky's very best."
1.0,solaris_1976,"A science fiction love story psychodrama, beautiful hypnotic film."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Waa-wa-wi-wa, whatta movie!"
1.0,solaris_1976,"It's sooooooooooooooo long. There are serious periods of languid shots and no dialogue and then when they do it's all in Russian. Made me cry like a baby, though. Repeatedly!"
1.0,solaris_1976,This is great! Slow at times but beautiful. Doesn't resemble Noir like the silly remake. I think this film raises far more question and even contains a political text about current Russia. More later...
1.0,solaris_1976,loistoteos. harmi kun jenkkien piti t√É¬§m√É¬§kin menn√É¬§ pilaamaan.
1.0,solaris_1976,A breath taking film about love. Not much more need be said. Except its amazing!
1.0,solaris_1976,Best sci fi flic ever. Stanley Kubrick could only wish . . .
1.0,solaris_1976,Its a masterpiece...more later.
1.0,solaris_1976,"A slow moving piece of art, but very worthwhile watching it."
1.0,solaris_1976,"One of Tarkovsky's best, and one of the best sci-fi's ever made"
1.0,solaris_1976,"A piece of Art. An ""introspective Sci-Fi movie"". Why should we look outside to find answers about ourselves?... by the way, you may wear a ""gafa-pasta"" if you don't want to fall asleep in the middle of the movie...."
1.0,solaris_1976,"The original Solaris (not the Clooney remake) is the only sci-fi film I've seen that approaches the profoundity of 2001. The effects are so poor they are laughable, yet the strange story and its characters had me in their grips very quickly."
1.0,solaris_1976,MASTERPIECE......i have only used that word for three other films but the second this film was over there were a variety of questions in my mind......This is what great films do to you...a vast journey into humanity....through the eyes of Kris Kelvin we come to understand our humanity..
1.0,solaris_1976,Georges Klounoff is great in this movie.
1.0,solaris_1976,"Andrei Tarkovsky's masterful visualization of the Stanislaw Lem novel. Beautiful, stylistic and deeply profound, this is precisely what cinema is or at least should be about."
1.0,solaris_1976,"this is an amazing movie. slow and long, yes (neither of those things is bad here). do not see the remake with clooney. i actually favor this over 2001 space odyssey"
1.0,solaris_1976,"A perfect representation of a solitary future... Tarkovsky built a station, a philosophy and an ideal, all without a single solid rocket booster."
1.0,solaris_1976,A sci-fi film less about the uncharted reaches of outer space than those within us all.
1.0,solaris_1976,"It¬¥s a Tarko. Not really a sci-fi movie, but a journey to the human soul. Love it to death."
1.0,solaris_1976,"you thought being at group zero on september the 11th would change your life, well you haven't seen solaris yet"
1.0,solaris_1976,Rivals 'Armageddon' as one of the greatest space epics of all time.
1.0,solaris_1976,"The Soderbergh version of this film simply doesn't do it justice. If anyone likes to see Solaris, PLEASE watch this film and not the recent remake."
1.0,solaris_1976,very good film but hard to watch get inside your head but that what it's all about...:-)
1.0,solaris_1976,We know the ocean is the brain... Deal with that!I commented on the 2002 remake by mistake somewhere else. That is an average quality photocopy of this terrific film
1.0,solaris_1976,"Confounding, frustrating, baffling, and utterly powerful. That final shot is brilliant."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Slow and stark, perhaps overly, but stylish and profound. Phantasy turns against itself."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Absolutely brilliant: beautiful, moving, horrifying, and thought provoking. Tarkovsky's film is one of the true masterpieces of science fiction as it examines grief, human identity, love, and the powers that both make us human as well as tear us apart."
1.0,solaris_1976,This is one of the greatest science-fiction films ever created.
1.0,solaris_1976,"Excellent! A long movie, at 2 hours 50 minutes, but worth every minute. One of the >BEST< Sci-Fi movies ever--a beautiful, poetic film contrasting reality and our inner desires. Don't even consider the 2002 remake--in my opinion."
1.0,solaris_1976,One of the best movies about love
1.0,solaris_1976,I love the Tarkhofski's one.
1.0,solaris_1976,"While I enjoyed the American version well enough, I easily prefer this one. While the American one focused on love, this focused on what makes someone human, and the result is a film which is much more complex and compelling."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Brilliant, deeply philosophical, and from the Russian/Soviet perspective. Not counting the ridiculously long driving scene early in the movie, its nearly flawless."
1.0,solaris_1976,Tarkovskys best picture. Long and slow but never boring. Top 10 movies of all time.
1.0,solaris_1976,"hell yes. No interest in seeing the remake, remaking this is the height of presumption."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Don't bother seeing the Americanised mainstream version of this cult Tarkovsky classic.Visually stunning and mentally stunning... hypnotic, oceanic, influential and by far quirky!"
1.0,solaris_1976,Tarkovsky's best... He's arguably the only good thing to come out of Russia.
1.0,solaris_1976,"Tarkovsky is a genius, and this is why."
1.0,solaris_1976,a slow-paced examination of what it means to be humani miss sci-fi like this
1.0,solaris_1976,"Slowly paced, but every second on screen is not wasted. It's not slow for slowness sake, but Tarkovsky forces you to be introspective, to think about what you are seeing and what it might mean to you. The ending, of course, is brilliant."
1.0,solaris_1976,a wonderful exploratory film that shines in its visionary direction and luminous acing.
1.0,solaris_1976,Strange haunting film classic. A must for every film buff
1.0,solaris_1976,"At times, this can be the slowest film you'll ever sit through. And yet, few films have ever managed to keep me hypnotized enough to be unable to pull away. Tarkovsky's directing here is beautiful, and befitting of the psychological depths here."
1.0,solaris_1976,The Russian counterpart to 2001. More philosophy in films please...
1.0,solaris_1976,my favorit film and book
1.0,solaris_1976,The best sci-fi movie ever because of the metaphysical exploration : What are the things you'll do different if you can ? What is your deepest dream ? your deepest need ?
1.0,solaris_1976,"A thoughtful and compelling science fiction drama in which exploration of the unknown turns out to be exploration of the self. It's slow, challenging, but hypnotic. In my humble opinion, the best science fiction film of all time."
1.0,solaris_1976,All I can say is why did it take me so long to see this. Tarkovsky captures my heart and head
1.0,solaris_1976,"It takes a while to get going and moves slowly once it does, but it's Tarkovsky; that's his thing. Stick with it, though, and it becomes a brilliant, shattering meditation on incarnation."
1.0,solaris_1976,Didn't 'really' get it until I owned it and could take my time with it. Absolutely love it
1.0,solaris_1976,Absolutely stunning!
1.0,solaris_1976,This film is very strange. Sometimes it may be one the slowest film you have ever seen... but it is one of the most fascinating as well.
1.0,solaris_1976,this is a deep meditation into your being. the ambience is superb and delivered strange feeling. the highway scene is amazingly strange.
1.0,solaris_1976,This movie is fascinating. It really makes you think. I couldn't take my eyes off it. You probably have to like stuff like ambient music and be awake enough to pay attention (it's long but I wouldn't cut a thing.)
0.0,solaris_1976,"Just watch bits and pieces of it, not what I expecting.......I seen it more confusing."
1.0,solaris_1976,"3 hours of meditation and thought. The most original and beautiful space movie ever made, by a guy that just knows how to make movies that are beautiful, creating and meaningful."
0.0,solaris_1976,"read the book, instead"
1.0,solaris_1976,Near perfection. Seriously.
1.0,solaris_1976,"Always mentioned as the ""Russian answer to 2001,"" this movie might be just as thought provoking. Definitely more emotional."
1.0,solaris_1976,"A true work of art which is still so relevant, so fresh, innovatine, moving and (I think) will always be."
1.0,solaris_1976,"old, but very strong and impressive.. as good as the book but in a tarkowskij- way :)"
1.0,solaris_1976,"Absolutely brilliant in every way. Meditative, haunting, and mystical; this film extends itself to the limits of human consciousness and the deceptive empiricism we like to call 'science.' Just brilliant."
1.0,solaris_1976,Tarkovsky's Solaris rules!
1.0,solaris_1976,"Based on the haunting novel by Stanislaw Lem, this film captures almost perfectly the mood and mystery of the book -- a rarity in sf. A conscious planet reifies our deepest, most painful memories -- are we mad, or do we have the chance to remake a failed past? No easy answers."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Liked this one better than the american version. Also don't try to read the English translation of the book, its lost way too much in translation."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Forget the re-done this is the real thing. A philosphical movie about life, guilt and human relations. Not easy to to to you but just plain brilliant."

1.0,solaris_1976,"Very heady, thought provoking film. Brilliant!"
1.0,solaris_1976,"A great movie, seen it a copule of day ago and never was disappointed. You don`t really expect visual effect of this kind of level from the 1972 film. But the main thing is ofcourse is how the actors play, how the make think about why are they doing it in the ways they do, great film."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Great thought provoking movie but the ending is just so out there, it confuses more than resolves things. Better than the Clooney remake in most respects."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Forget about the re-make, this is the version to see. The drama's more effective and the visuals are cooler."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Solaris 2002 est tr√®s bien aussi, mais je veux pas comparer ici. Si vous aimez les films, lisez le livre certains passages mon donnez froid dans le dos, si si. stanislas Lem nous a quitt√© en 2006."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Amazing film. Yes, it's slow and methodical, but Tarkovsky is at his best here."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Great sci-fi fairytale. If you are going to watch solyaris you should watch the original first. The hollywood remake has its merits too, but looses some of the magic of the original. highly recommended."
1.0,solaris_1976,"le meilleur film de science fiction, et c'est plus que de la SF, merci TARKO!"
1.0,solaris_1976,Russian cinematography at its best
1.0,solaris_1976,"One of the greatest science fiction films of all time, stylistically beautiful and incredibly thought-provoking, this original version (later somewhat remade by Soderburgh) has the powerfully philisophical dialog that the remake lacks - a signature of Tarkovsky and his Russian foundation."
1.0,solaris_1976,This is like a surreal travel into the human mind. It is clearly not a movie for everyone. Heavy weight film.
1.0,solaris_1976,Impactante...nunca espere que una pelicula de tarkovsky me gustara tanto...

1.0,solaris_1976,"Gorgeous cinematography, inspired narrative structure. The switches between colour and black and white are inspired, and inspirational. Watch this."
1.0,solaris_1976,"A master piece, the travel of a cosmonaut as a difficult track to forget the human weaknesses, the space seen as a philosofical playground for humanity."
1.0,solaris_1976,"Such a great film, though sometimes that doesn't matter. Someone else must introduce you to the film. It is never the case of finding it on your own. Great rebuttle to 2001."

1.0,kubo_and_the_two_strings_2016,"While this is a ""family film,"" the basic themes are adult - community, family, death, grief, mourning, and memory.

1.0,1010678-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,"Every bit an icon as it is a staple in science-fiction cinema, Invasion fits an entire story of political and fear-driven commentary within a short amount of time.

1.0,1010678-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,Classic allegorical 1950s sci-fi piece whose ideas and themes haven't dated at all. Story about people being replaced by emotionless duplicates still provides thrills and chills. Even the studio-enforced happy(ish) ending can't spoil it.

1.0,1010678-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,"This is classic sci-fi. I have to put this down with the 1978 version, both have their own 'twists' which add their own flavour - but this was the one that started all the remakes.

1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"Not cheezy at all, and very interesting. This movie was perfect for the cold war, and the message still means a lot today.

1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"Much better than the remake. A film that gets people in touch with a higher truth. That the human race's survival means thinking in larger terms; thinking that we're more alike than different. It envokes the lyrics of ""Imagine"" by John Lennon."

1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,By far one of my favourite movies. Simple message the whole world really needs.... shame it may never happen.

1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"An excellent piece of classic cinema during a time of widespread fear across the globe.

1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"1000% better than the 2008 version. Sure, it's b/w and from 1951 ""studio technology"", but TRUST me...this is pretty much my fav movie ever, and I was appalled @ the ""remake""! If it ain't broke, don't fix it! This original 1951 version is CLASSIC, and for a reason!"
1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,"This has some really good acting to it. There was plenty of passion, fear, curiosity, and tension... not to mention hope. The new one has a few down-sides to it and was abit dissappointed."

1.0,1005371-day_the_earth_stood_still,A perfect movie which deserves multiple viewings. Rennie is just right as Klaatu who visits planet Earth to deliver an important message affecting the human existence. Some of the special effects are dated but still an intelligent entry in the sci-fi generation of the '50s.

1.0,terminator,One of the best and well know sci-fi movies ever.
1.0,terminator,In top 10 films all time.
1.0,terminator,"Iconic. I would pay good money to see Arnie as the villain again, and no money at all to see him pregnant/twinned with an afterbirth/baby-sitting John Connor/you name it. Arnie is an emotionless Cyborg, I refuse to believe anything else!"

1.0,terminator,Supremely well paced action film that manages to be smart as well as exciting. A seminal work and prototype for the modern merging of action and science fiction. James Cameron appears to have taken many cues of Ridley's Alien.
1.0,terminator,Watching the original this morning. Not bad for 1984.

1.0,terminator,The most overlooked movie of all time.  The most underrated love story of all time.  The plot for this movie was written in a van.  The movie's exposition is delivered crouched in a 1980's Chevy.  Yet it is still one the most original story-lines ever conceived.  My all time personal favorite movie.
1.0,terminator,what can I say about this film apart from its fantastic and definitely deserves 5 stars

1.0,ex_machina,"A film about a man who wins the chance to help test an AI on its intelligence. Within under two hours, Ex Machina brilliantly explores multiple ideas as well as depths of its three main characters.

1.0,ex_machina,"Me gust√≥ mucho el film, creo que la combinaci√≥n de un buen gui√≥n y una fuerte interpretaci√≥n de los actores dio a la pel√≠cula un sentido de direcci√≥n inmejorable, creando un ambiente tenso y un desenlace poco predecible y satisfactorio."

1.0,ex_machina,"Not a sequel, not a prequel, not a reboot... Finally a movie with a (rather) original plot, and a good one too. So they can still make new movies in Hollywood ? Good news.Witty, pretty... Not the most entertaining, but smart and pretty smooth."
1.0,ex_machina,Excellent film. Ditto any other good review
1.0,ex_machina,"The idea of the AI itself is just way bombastic! Thrilling, dark yet mysterious storyline with a terrific flow of plot. Consider this as one of the best film in 2015!(But here comes a question, how do the AI recharge herself after getting into the city??)"

1.0,ex_machina,Everything about this movie is a masterpiece.
1.0,ex_machina,"I found myself going over this over and over in my mind. While watching I thought maybe Ava wasn't an AI at all, but a doppelg√§nger of Nathan, and Nathan would turn out to be the AI."
1.0,ex_machina,"Easily one of the best movies of 2015, the claustrophobic feel of Ex Machina allows the movie to be creative with its runtime, and its mature, complicated psychological themes make it especially memorable."

1.0,captain_america_civil_war,Favorite out of the whole Captain America trilogy.
1.0,captain_america_civil_war,"I need six stars. Loved it.Loved the real tension between characters and worldviews.

1.0,captain_america_civil_war,Captain America is a bad ass and he's played so well by Evans. I'm not a huge Iron Man fan and I find Batman boring but I've always been a sucker for Captain America and Superman- real superheroes if you ask me.

1.0,captain_america_civil_war,I loved this movie!!! It had great action scenes and a plot that kept you wanting to see how it would all resolve.

1.0,wall_e,"Breaths life into,as you can think at first,lifeless things."
1.0,wall_e,I NEED MY OWN WALL-E NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!this is Pixar's # 1 in my opinion. It's funny how EVE represents an apple device and WALL-E is a Microsoft. It is just great in every way

1.0,wall_e,"Brilliant from smart to finish, WALL-E never panders to kids, in fact it may Pixar's most adult film - with a first 30 minutes that is ambitious, risky and even audience alienating if not done right. Thankfully, WALL-E deserve every ounce of praise it gets."

1.0,wall_e,Very enjoyable movie...even the tenth time!!
1.0,wall_e,"While my favorite Pixars will always be The Incredibles, the Toy Stories, and Monster's Inc., will not deny the fact that WALL-E is Pixar's absolute best and most important movie. It is a movie that truly has something to say. Near perfection. Bravo."
1.0,wall_e,Visually stunning. Incredible story. A remarkable animated film that presents an interesting social commentary.
1.0,wall_e,"This is the best movie I have seen in soooo long! I laughed, I cried... This is totally in my top 3 favorite movies. So funny and you just cannot help but fall in love with wall-e. I grew up with E.T.... and this just knocked that out of my top list."

1.0,wall_e,"Not my favorite, but certainly the best of Pixar. There is a difference."
1.0,wall_e,I challenge anyone to watch this and not fall for Wall¬∑e!
1.0,wall_e,"Wall-E is beautifully made and it manages to tell a love story without any dialogue at all (something which Up did the next year to the tenth degree). It's brilliant, but what keeps it from being my favorite is the perhaps overbearing themes throughout."
1.0,wall_e,Best animated film ever!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,wall_e,"Designed to tug at your heartstrings, but done with such nuanced flair, I wish I could give it a bonus star."
1.0,wall_e,A film you can never get tired of.
1.0,wall_e,It has a GREAT message and the animation is a fantastic example of how far Disney has come.
1.0,wall_e,"If you can get past the obvious politicalism and ignore the poor fat people jokes, this one is hillarious! Oh, and be sure to catch the short ""Presto"" before Wall-e starts. Get that popcorn and get seated!!"
1.0,wall_e,"Another memorable Disney-Pixar gem. A simple and well made science fiction movie that kids and adults will enjoy, along with the important message of caring for the environment, the earth, our home."
1.0,wall_e,"Tell me a movie that in the first 30 mins., that has no dialog but conveys so much within that time frame with that kind of CGI beauty?"
0.0,wall_e,Movie is borning and lame
1.0,wall_e,"In addition to its undeniable sweetness, there is ecological commentary embedded in Wall-E that succeeds without preaching at its audience."

1.0,wall_e,"still such a wonderful/beautilful film,stunning cgi & good story with funny scenes & charactersone of the best pixar films so far, a masterpiece"
1.0,wall_e,"The movie was full of heart and it made us all turn the other sheeck, stop and think about the world for a moment."
1.0,wall_e,Eva and Wall-e's love is truly touching. Teaches kids to stay close to good friends and you can accomplish anythimg
1.0,wall_e,"Had been looking forward to this film since I saw the first trailer and was not disappointed. Once again, Pixar delivers a great love story between two endearing characters and also (though unintentionally) delivers an environmental message of what we humans are doing to our home."
1.0,wall_e,Really good n funny movie
1.0,wall_e,I cried at the brilliant emotion portrayed in this superb romance from Pixar.
1.0,wall_e,The perfect animated movie
1.0,wall_e,Another great example of what Disneys Pixar has to offer. A very moving movie even though there was no dialog. Its almost as if I could feel what Wall-E was feeling.
1.0,wall_e,The primary use of body language in this film makes it unique. The ptomaine displays it's boldness in a good light.
1.0,wall_e,"Arguably Pixar's masterpiece and inarguably one of the greatest films in cinema history, ""WALL-E"" is supremely intelligent, touching, and nostalgic, with characters and themes more poignant than most live-action pictures could only dream of possessing."
1.0,wall_e,This movie is wonderful.
1.0,wall_e,"It's very hard to pick a favorite Pixar Movie, but for me Wall-e comes very very close. The way the story is told makes you care so much for the main character's journey, which combined with mind Blowing visuals and sounds, results in a Amazing Movie! Thanks again Pixar"
1.0,wall_e,This has got to be one of the greatest movies I have ever seen in my entire life.
1.0,wall_e,"Wall-E is a maturely conceived production that largely succeeds emotionally, visually, and intelligently."

1.0,wall_e,"Convertido en un cl√°sico de Pixar gracias a su emotividad fuerte, escenograf√≠a e im√°genes bell√≠simas y potentes, y una premisa simplemente perfecta. Es toda una oda al g√©nero de la animaci√≥n y de la misma manera, a la humanidad."
1.0,wall_e,"Pixar had done toys, bugs, cars, monsters and superheroes. They'd already done a film set underwater. So, a film set in space with robots as main characters was an obvious choice, right? Well, they pulled it off spectacularly. It's one of my favourite films of all time."
1.0,wall_e,I love it great childrens movie
1.0,wall_e,"A love story of robots Wall-E and Eve attempting to save Earth over a plant, how simple for Pixar to make another grand slam. Also has a cool message in which you must not rely entirely on robotics to prolong your human life. It'll make you fat."

1.0,wall_e,this movie was everything i expected it to be and more. really adorable!! who knew a cock roach could be so cute!
1.0,wall_e,"This just prooves that the Pixar folks are supreme storytellers. You would expect the visual greatness, but that takes a backseat to the characters. While later viewings may make me wish for a bit less commentary, and more of Wall-E exploring Earth... this movie is just plain great."
1.0,wall_e,"Amazing how they can tell such an amazing robot love story without saying a word. Beautiful visuals and heartwarming story., just the thing we expect from a Disney Pixar."

1.0,wall_e,By far the best pixar film of all time !!
1.0,wall_e,"Where do I begin? Lovely, charming, stellar images. Forget it being one of the best Pixar films, it's one of the best Sci-Fi films period. WALL-E and Eve have great chemistry together, and the way it looks is just breathtaking. And wait, it's a movie promoting environmentalism that's....SUBTLE???"
1.0,wall_e,Can't saw nothing bad about this movie. Everything was excellent!! PIXAR does it again! A Classic!! An animated 2001.
1.0,wall_e,Freaking phenomenal. The sound design is truly the highlight of Wall-E and of course it's full of beautiful animation. How did Andrew Stanton go from this to John Carter?

1.0,wall_e,"Wall -E is just wonderful, especially the first part where Wall-E is on his own just going about his daily business. Nothing else I can add to all the rave reviews it's received, except to say see it on a big screen!"

1.0,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,"Although a very slight drop from the previous film (Dawn) being a bit long/slow at times, it does continue to entertain and keep the reboot collection in tact.

1.0,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,"War is one of the best films in general and one of the best third films in a trilogy that completes the arcs it created for its characters, tells a unique original story while also homaging that makes sense, but also does unexpected things with story and how it plays out."
1.0,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,Serkis and Harrelson sky rocket this movie into being perhaps better than it has any business being. Its commentary on the way we treat one another within society and what truly makes us human is astoundingly visceral and though provoking. Maybe the best film of 2017.
1.0,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,"Wow. That's all I have to say, it was brilliant. The story is complex and interesting, there were certainly a lot of emotional parts and the action wasn't the best but still one of the best I've seen in a long time."

1.0,discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie,My favorite by Bunuel! Truly fabulous!
1.0,discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie,The only disappointing thing is that the giant lips with legs wearing a hat on the cover of the dvd never shows up in the movie.
1.0,discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie,"[color=#ffffff]Bu√±uel's brilliant, savagely witty masterpiece skewers terrorism, socialism, and politics, combining dark humor, reality, fantasy, and biting social satire.[/color]"
1.0,discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie,"Possibly the best movie I have ever seen. Each scene is a treasure. Superlative acting and thinking. A scathing depiction of the bourgeoisie, a hilarious portrayal of a new class. I will stop talking; words cannot express conveniently what this film represents."
1.0,gojira,"It never falters, delivers on all of it's promises, and has an entertaining and very mind-absorbing plot, which bears more meaning than most of us can possibly even imagine. But in the end, one thing's for sure, and that is that this is Godzilla, and he has never. . . ever. . . been better."
1.0,gojira,"holds up very well. top 10 movie. analogy of nuclear war. haunting with a guy in a rubber suit, how do you pull that off with such a great visual ad aural movie?!"
0.0,gojira,I thought this movie was boring. I dont get how Godzilla became such a huge thing if this was the original.
1.0,gojira,My favorite movie ever
1.0,gojira,"A timeless classic that dealt with nuclear issues, still relevant today."
1.0,gojira,A good deal of time in my childhood was spent watching Godzilla movies. I loved the campy ones back then but have developed an appreciation for the original as I have aged.
1.0,gojira,"Good film, great story, great lesson and is full of action"
1.0,gojira,I LOVE GOJIRA!!!!!!!
1.0,gojira,"This is my favorite movie of all time. Gojiras suit is really menacing and he just looks real Ishiro Honda can make movies, sadly people think the new Godzilla movies are better but in my opinion this is the best."
1.0,gojira,"A cinematic masterpiece, historical movie treasure. This film is awesome. Special effects are tremendous. The use of miniature models is superb. Night scenes with Godzilla photographed flawlessly. Social message is strong and clear given the dark times of the postwar world and a fear of nuclear war."
1.0,gojira,I was delightfully surprised by the human elements in this movie. It's one of the rarest horror movies to make me sympathize sincerely for humanity.
1.0,gojira,100/A+. One of the best postwar commentary and anti nuclear films. Yes it's the same movie with a guy in a giant lizard costume destroy miniature sections of Tokyo and toy military vehicles.
1.0,gojira,The original Godzilla film is a masterpiece of Japanese cinema!
1.0,gojira,"The most iconic movie from Japan, Godzilla or Gojira is a impact of cinema with it's classic technology of a man in a rubber suit. So satisfying to see destruction at it's best!"
1.0,gojira,"Spectacular, deeply political, and emotionally moving artwork!!"
1.0,gojira,Great Movie with a great message about the atomic weapons
1.0,gojira,Best monster from Japon and one of my favorites.
1.0,gojira,A masterpiece. Both very dark and very haunting.
1.0,gojira,"One of my all-time favourite movies and in no way a B-movie, but a grim, heart-felt disaster movie which metaphors Godzilla in a perfect way."
1.0,gojira,One of the best monster movies.
1.0,gojira,"One of, if not the best monster film ever made, great film, second, in my mind only to Jaws"
1.0,gojira,You Rottentomatoes people need to give this movie a 100% postive.
1.0,gojira,Great with the actors treating this as a natural disaster
1.0,gojira,A timeless classic! Nothing else to say but you need to watch this!
1.0,gojira,The roaring granddaddy of kaiju films.
1.0,gojira,A truly epic and dramatic piece of Japanese cinema.
1.0,gojira,"If you're uninitiated, I can almost guarantee that the tone of the third act will surprise you, even if you aren't impressed by Tsuburaya's now archaic, but nevertheless ingenious effects"
1.0,gojira,My absolute favorite film ever made
1.0,gojira,Probably the best monster movie ever made.
1.0,gojira,The very first and best godzilla movie ever made and it came 60 years ago
1.0,gojira,Amazing! Best Monster Film Alltime
1.0,gojira,"Not a classic monster movie. The classic monster movie. It may not be my exact number one favorite Godzilla, but its close. This is an amazing and intriguing movie. It's dark and somber and its not to be missed."
1.0,gojira,One of the greatest monster movies of all timeGreat acting that makes feel for the character Great effects (for its time)Great cinematography And great soundtrack that will last forever
1.0,gojira,The original masterpiece Gojira. It's potent and has impact and is a classic for a reason.
1.0,gojira,"Devastating, enthralling, and actually quite frightening; Gojira is a biting piece of post-war commentary and as timeless as it is politically astute."
1.0,gojira,Man in rubber suit tramples on matchstick models of Tokyo as denizens look up in terror. The original Godzilla is all that and more. The original Godzilla is far different from the tag team slogfests that followed. Much imitated (I'm talking about you Jurassic Park) but rarely bettered.
1.0,gojira,"Even after all these years, it's still a great movie."
1.0,gojira,"Gojira(Godzilla) is a film of great suspense, brilliant storytelling, amazing effects(for time) and spectacular characters. These factors and more make this my personal pick for the greatest movie of all time."
1.0,gojira,"While the special effects are dated, it still holds up to this day as the best monster movie of all time, offering emotionally gripping human drama that provides a chilling realistic atmosphere. It all builds up to an epic third act that will forever leave us questioning our ethics and morals."
1.0,gojira,original definitely a classic monster movie
1.0,gojira,A chilling masterpiece deserving of a 60 year (and counting!) franchise

1.0,gojira,The amazing birth of the most iconic monster in film history
1.0,gojira,"A Product of the Times, Yet Also Far Ahead of it's Time, Godzilla (or Gojira) remains as a staple of the monster movie, and one of the few to truly take advantage of it, dated, yet timeless, it's a movie that stands as tall as it's title monster"
1.0,gojira,One of the greatest monster movies ever. Genuinely scary too.
1.0,gojira,Godjira is one of the few 1950s monster films that has managed to stand the test of time. It is fantastic!

1.0,gojira,Perfection! Awesome atomic warfare allegory!!! Brilliant!!! So thought-provoking!!!
1.0,gojira,A master peice by every definition of the word. It truly brings to life the horrors of nuclear war and is much more serious and gritty in tone than the more campy sequels of the 60's and 70's. Looking forward to the new one coming may 2014!
1.0,gojira,This movie is Beautiful. A masterpiece. More than a monster movie
1.0,gojira,Gojira is more than your average monster flick; it shows the suffering and pain of a nation that experienced first hand the horrors of the atomic age.

1.0,gojira,Incredible and great. Gojira has a great story and its monster was ficious.
1.0,gojira,"Possibly my favorite monster movie of all time. Godzilla looks menacing and the gritty, black-and-white cinematography and the dark tone makes the destruction of Tokyo look that much more catastrophic."
1.0,gojira,"Every manga, every anime, every cartoon, every movie that deals with monsters has its foundation and influences based around this one iconic monster."
1.0,gojira,"Everyone knows Godzilla, it's a fact. This is the film that started it all, with a strong Anti - Nuke message and a hell of a lot of destruction. It is easy to see why this movie is a cultural icon!"
1.0,gojira,Manages to be a bleak and effective allegory while at the same time being a fun monster movie.
1.0,gojira,"DVD Original, Theatrical"
1.0,gojira,"A great entry in science fiction cinema worldwide. From beggining to end, it is amazing to watch. It takes itself much more serious than what the average person might suppose, and it's a definite ""must-see"" for any sci-fi fan."

1.0,gojira,The criterion edition makes the picture quality look better than ever. And i actually like the 1956 American version as well.

1.0,gojira,Beautiful! Rich! Moving! Gojira!
1.0,gojira,"More than just a monster movie, a great social commentary. For those who think the idea of a man in a rubber suit is stupid, it looks far more realistic than CGI! What a classic movie, I enjoy it more every time I watch it."
1.0,gojira,"One of the most incredible movies of all time. No, really. It's far beyond the cheesy 60's Godzilla and totally takes it seriously. As well, its far better than even the U.S. Raymond Burr version. As good, if not better, than the classic King Kong, and deserving of much more appreciation."
1.0,gojira,"Groundbreaking monster film, that tells of the dangers of nuclear bombs. Deals with serious issues via a form of entertainment. Great classic film."
1.0,gojira,Unexpectedly depressing and emotionally resonant. A franchise that turned into silly fun started out as a fascinating anti-war masterpiece.
1.0,gojira,The Classics can never go out of hand. 4 Stars! check it out if you are a godzilla fan!
1.0,gojira,"Truly one of the greatest foreign films ever. It breaks the mold of what a monster movie can be, and started a whole legacy of its own. One of my all time favorites."
1.0,gojira,"On the surface 50's monster B-movie, underneath allegory for war and nuclear weapons. Corny and cheesy at times, it is also haunting and terrifying when it needs to be. This movie pretty much launched the kaiju and tokusatsu film industries in Japan."
1.0,gojira,Stunning japanese masterpeice.
1.0,gojira,Easily one of the best monster movies ever made. The movie looks great in black and white and has nice charm to it. This movie had good special effects for the time and is very enjoyable.

1.0,gojira,The origianl that shows the beautiful classic affects of Eiji Tsubaraya. And doens't feature perry mason to ruin it.
1.0,gojira,This is a great monster movie that goes beyond the typical campy stuff and actually tells very dark tale with a powerful message about war and its affect on humanity.
1.0,gojira,men in rubber monster suits... this is what classic movie making is ALL about
1.0,gojira,This film got me into Godzilla. Plain and Simple.
1.0,gojira,Classic monster movie. It has never grown old for me.
1.0,gojira,"This is my FAVORITE Godzilla movie, I like it more than final wars. Why? Because it starts the legend of Gojira (Godzilla)"
1.0,gojira,"Absolutely astounding. No other film in the series (with the exception of Return of Godzilla) captures the power and horror of the beast. He is the bomb, and while watching his destruction of Japan, you start to believe it"
1.0,gojira,"If you've only seen the American re-edit, then you haven't seen Godzilla. This one packs an emotional whallop!"
1.0,gojira,As much as I love the Burr version (and I do) the original Japanese version of Gojira (Godzilla) is an absolute masterpiece. It truly captures the horrors that Japan suffered in the aftermath of the atomic bomb.
1.0,gojira,"Godzilla is the man, The beginning of a 50 year monster icon."
1.0,gojira,This is a MASTERPIECE
1.0,gojira,"The original Japanese masterpiece, as it was meant to be seen. Yeah, the American version is a nice 50's monster movie, but this version transcends beyond that, and it's message can be heard for modern audiences at last."
1.0,gojira,"Gojira aka Godzilla (1954) is THE greatest monster movie ever made, and if you can get passed the 50 year old low budget effects you'll see the way Godzilla was meant to be seen"
1.0,gojira,The Japanese version is better than the American (Raymond Burr) version.
1.0,gojira,"A Frankenstein fable for the atomic age, supported by brilliant acting (yes! in a Godzilla movie) and ingenious lighting make this Kaiju classic no laughing matter."
1.0,gojira,"Very dark, and sometimes scary, especially layered shots of Godzilla and the people running at his feet. Very moving, and heavy. Akira Ifikube's score is incredible, and makes the film work. An excellent cast, and compelling story make this a deep impact in cinematic history."
1.0,gojira,"After so many years and so many viewings this film hasn't lost a bit of power or effect. It stands above the rest not because it was the first in the Godzilla series, but because it experiments heavily with a narrative style that resembles what we call cutting edge today."
1.0,gojira,"I'm serious, Godzilla has balls. Other movies go great with Megadeth!"
1.0,gojira,Easily the best monster film ever.
1.0,gojira,The most powerful most moving most purposeful Godzilla movie and the first of them all

1.0,gojira,The original! Watch the Japanese version to understand the movie better.
1.0,gojira,"THE monster movie of the 20th Century - though also much more. As dark and disturbing a nuclear allegory today as it was in 1954, GOJIRA is, quite simply, a masterpiece."
1.0,gojira,"This movie is a masterpiece. It is more than just a monster running loose film, it is a terrifing reminder of the horrors of nuclear weapons and testing. Seeing a mother huddled in rumble with her two children, telling them they will all be with daddy soon, is heart wrenching in a horrifing manner."
1.0,gojira,Fantastic. Puts a smile on my face every time.
1.0,gojira,"The original Godzilla was a horror movie with no pretense of good and evil, simply the mind-numbing destruction of a man-made force."
1.0,gojira,The one that started it all - deep amazing and moving - this is not just a guy in suit this is a real film a cry against the arms race and the maddness of war. (not that guy in the suit films are bad).
1.0,gojira,The Classic! You Must See!!!
1.0,gojira,One of the best monster movies ever - especially the uncut Japanese original.
1.0,gojira,Nuclear weapons are bad. Movies with big giant fire breathing monsters on a rampage are awesome.  I really want to watch the rest of the Godzilla movies now.
1.0,gojira,This is the original Japanese edit without all the American crap with Raymond Burr sliced in. It's so much better!!
1.0,gojira,This is the best monster movie ever made. It is simply amazing.
1.0,gojira,"The absolute pinnacle of monster movies. This is the measure by which all others are weighed, measured, and found wanting."
1.0,gojira,I love all the TOYO Godzilla films ... but here it started. Even better is the real original version sans Raymond Burr
1.0,gojira,"The first one, and definitely one of the greatest. The original Japanese version, this one, is FAR superior to the Americanization with Raymond Burr. Scarier, too."
1.0,gojira,"Just... too... awesome. This is the kind of monster movie I grew up with, in fact it's the king of them all. It also has a great meaning behind it."
1.0,gojira,This is the one that started it all. The original Japanese cut that is more powerful than the American cut. A classic to change people's view on giant monster movies.
1.0,gojira,"This movie is the original Godzilla, and it's bad ass for being from the 50's. FUCK CLOVERFIELD!"
1.0,gojira,best science fiction film made in japan and the best of the series of godzilla
1.0,gojira,Just terrifying. Still the best monster on film.
1.0,gojira,Top notch sound effects and costumes! A++
1.0,gojira,The Japanese version is better than the American if you don't mind subtitle.
1.0,gojira,"After growing up with the silly American re-working of this film and eventually discovering the original on a low-quality bootleg copy of a copy, it's wonderful to finally have a proper version of this film in my collection."
1.0,gojira,"Sad, unflinching and potent."
1.0,gojira,The first and Still the best.
1.0,gojira,"the ultimate classic that spawned more than 20 sequels and made monster movies what they are today. every monster after this was modeled after godzilla, but you gotta love the big ol lizard. if your a fan of him, you have to have seen this movie. its where it all started."
1.0,gojira,One of my favorite films of all time
1.0,gojira,This is the original un-cut Japanese version which is much longer and more in-depth than the heavily cut American Version.
1.0,gojira,"One of the greatest movies ever made, finally released in America in it's unsanitized version. Even my father, who self identifies as a right wing Republican, loved it when we sat down and watched it together. Watch it with a friend, you'll have something to talk about at the end."
1.0,gojira,The greatest move ever filmed. The true king of all movies.
1.0,gojira,"It's a masterpiece, I am proud of tha t this film affected famous directors after all. It's classic but still better than the remake in Hollywood"
1.0,gojira,Definitely a masterpiece. Groundbreaking filming techniques make this movie a must see for any science fiction fan.
1.0,gojira,great. i didn't think the first godzilla movie would be smart
1.0,gojira,Much more grittier and gripping than the dubbed American version with Raymond Burr. Japanese movies also sound more serious in the original Japanese.
1.0,gojira,"Back when Godzilla movies were serious. Basically, an allegory for the A-Bomb. Also, the greatest giant monster movie of all time."
1.0,gojira,"The original Godzilla, and the only good one. More a social commentary then a monster flick, this movie is compelling and beautifully filmed. One of my favorited movies since I was about 3."
1.0,gojira,"Way betterthan the Americanized bastardization of it. The metaphor was straightforward, yet moving nonetheless."
1.0,gojira,It is an all time classic plus the start really of all the big monster movies. Plus it is one of the better Godzilla films too.
1.0,gojira,A seriously great monster movie.
1.0,gojira,Accept no substitutes.
1.0,gojira,Accept no substitutes.
1.0,gojira,"Do not watch the American cut, accept only the original source of all our terrors, the one and the original. Everyone who made this movie would have PERSONAL connections to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and THIS is their story, a film which has no peers."
1.0,gojira,Haunting and Original! This flick is more than just a monster movie. It packs a real message about the dangers of nuclear weaponry and will no doubt leave you in tears.
1.0,gojira,A short review..if you have never seen a Godzilla movie.THis is the one you should see
1.0,gojira,"Say what you want about the sequels, but don't make fun of this one. It actually succeeds at being serious and bleak."
1.0,gojira,THE greatest monster movie ever made. And that is not an opinion.
1.0,gojira,Pure classic. If only there were more movies like this.
1.0,gojira,Total Classic...I tend to not like monster movies but this is like few others. A lot of politcal comentary in this one.
1.0,gojira,"The classic, the one that started it all and really deserving of classic status, but only the Japanese version not the inferior American version."
1.0,gojira,"For being 1954, spectacular effects, also makes you think about the effect of nuclear weapons. The line from the song godzilla comes to mind. ""History shows again and again how nature points to the falling of man."""
1.0,gojira,"screw Jaws and The Host, this is the best monster-on-the-loose flick ever made, AND a poignant statement about the horrors of war. if you can see the original Japanese version you'll never look at men in suits the same way again."
1.0,gojira,"The Rolls Royce of monster movies, ""Gojira"" is simply a legendary classic."
1.0,gojira,"Possibly the most brilliant and deep monster movie ever, ever. If you've only seen the american version, this is a totally different film."
1.0,gojira,"The original 1954 version is much more in depth than many would be lead to believe, and Akira Ifukube's score is stellar. The American version while butchered is still pretty good."
1.0,gojira,see the original version from japan. It is awesome.
1.0,gojira,"Both versions are great. I think comparison between the two is unnecessary, now that they are sold together. The original is great, Burr is great too. He really knew how to ""serious"" it up! Godzilla used to be scary; but was always fun!!"
1.0,gojira,a landmark in cinema history. incredible movie. one of the best movies ever made.
1.0,gojira,the original is always the best
1.0,gojira,"The 1954 Japanese version is a masterpiece with an obvious allegory and symbolism to WWII and the atomic bombings in Japan. Oh, and the U.S. version is still pretty fun."
1.0,gojira,"The original 1954 masterpiece, and it's FAR different from it's many sequels and imitators. Brilliantly done, and the symbolism is powerful."
1.0,gojira,"""Just go and watch it dammit!!!"""
1.0,gojira,More than a mere monster movie with a guy in a rubber suit smashing cardboard buildings and model tanks and planes. An artful and somber allegory to WWII and the atomic bomb. See this before the American version. It's better.
1.0,gojira,If you don't like this...you aren't a real person. Gojira forever.
1.0,gojira,The Original -and The Best.
1.0,gojira,"Although the effects are dated, the movie remains a compelling allegory for nuclear warfare. While it's not the goofiest, it's the best ""Godzilla"" film. Akira Ifukube supplies a pulse-pounding score."
1.0,gojira,"The one that started it all. If you are a serious Big G fan, you'll watch both. If not, avoid the campiness and watch the original Japanese version. It's more enjoyable."
1.0,gojira,The one that started it all. Japan's allegorical piece about nuclear weapons which would be the foundation of an unlikely long lived franchise.
1.0,gojira,Very underrated. Actually has some very moving scenes and a real message and point. Essential to see the original Japanese version.
1.0,gojira,"A man in a rubber-suit, do I need to say more?"
1.0,gojira,"The beginning of the greatest series of films, ever."
1.0,gojira,Best monster movie. Ever.
1.0,gojira,most people see a giant rubber suit . . . those people are fucking retarded
1.0,gojira,basically the best giant monster film on earth
1.0,gojira,The ultimate giant monster movie. The American version (Godzilla: King of the Monsters) is passable but misses the point.
1.0,gojira,Japanese version all the way! How it was meant to be seen.
1.0,gojira,Godzilla rocks!!!!!!!!! I have loved this movie since I was a little kid!
1.0,gojira,One of the best Japanese films ever made. This is the one that started it all.
1.0,gojira,"The greatest movie ever made. I've seen it over 3,000 times!!!!"
1.0,gojira,Hauntingly beautiful anti-nuclear movie.
1.0,gojira,"Not only a great monster movie, Gojira is a powerful allegory for the atomic age from the one nation that knows the true horror of atomic power."
1.0,gojira,Its Godzilla whats not to like
1.0,gojira,"Godzilla's darkest and perhaps crowning hour, one that represents the monster as not only a city destroying fiend but a threat to man's very extistence. As many other reviews have said the undercurrents of this movie are very deep and potentially very disturbing as well."
1.0,gojira,"Even better in the original Japanese version- Find out how they REALLY feel about us and our ""devices"""
1.0,gojira,"The ORIGINAL!!! No Raymond Burr, etc.."
1.0,gojira,"I was a fan when I was a kid, but I am sticking with this film especially because it is incredible, given that it is from 1954. With the effects they had at the time, this is by far one of the best movies ever made."
1.0,gojira,"very good, very sad, anti war and nuclear weapons movie"
1.0,gojira,This is the very first Godzilla movie for the period it was one of the best post war (WW2) films ever done. The original is a must see. Hands down.
1.0,gojira,"The best G-film period and also a landmark for Horror and Sci-Fi. This film paved the way for other Japanese films, shows, and games to become popular. A film that will go down in history."
1.0,gojira,"The best Godzilla film is the original. unlike every movie after this one, this is genuinly a good movie. (I do like all the other movies, but lets be real, their cheesy as hell.) This movie is full of symbolism about nuclear weapons. I urge everyone to see this movie."
1.0,gojira,"Not what you would expect from the King of the Monsters. This is him before the fame and foes acting as an analogy. a statement in post war Japanese fear and anxiety, a horror of it's time and classic of ours"
1.0,gojira,"Best monster movie, ever. Some of the camerawork is truly brilliant, and Godzilla is a great commentary on post-Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan."
1.0,gojira,"The best Godzilla by far. Its raw film making doesnt patronise the viewer like most modern movies, allowing the simple effects, storyline and atmosphere work its magic."
1.0,gojira,The quintessential Japanese monster movie.
1.0,gojira,The movie that started it all. This movie i saw when i was a little kid and got me into the whole moster movie thing. I have been a fan every since and this movie captivates everything that is amazing about the original movie monster.
1.0,gojira,Do yourself a favour and look past the fact that there's a man in a lizard suit and don't let yourself miss this timeless sci-fi classic! It's was the catalyst for the giant monster movie and also drives home a deeper message about the horrors of nuclear weapons.
1.0,gojira,"The original, the classic. The one that started it all."
1.0,gojira,Great Nuclear Message without all the American Bastardizations.
1.0,gojira,One of the greatest films of all time
1.0,gojira,I've never quite gotten over this movie.
1.0,gojira,"The quintessential giant monster film. Arguably the only one in the genre that can be considered a masterpiece of cinema. Dark and somber in tone, with tons of subtleties. Easily on par with the best the movie world has to offer. Also, giant monster smashing shit."
1.0,gojira,The lack of respect given to this movie and Ishiro Honda sickens me.
1.0,gojira,EXCELLENT. I finally have seen the REAL version. And I loved it.
1.0,gojira,The original. Nothing more to say.
1.0,gojira,Best monster movie of all time.
1.0,gojira,"Finally, America gets to see the origonal film that made Godzilla a ledgend"
1.0,gojira,"It is the undisputed king of all monster movies, a dark and deeply disturbing metaphor for the monster that is American hubris."
1.0,gojira,"They should do a remake, but not like the one they already made. A japanese remake. 'Twould be sweet."
1.0,gojira,"Not just a fantastic monster movie, that's just the selling feature. It's a fantastic anti-war/anti-nuclear movie depicting scenes of struggle and hardship much like the aftermath of Hiroshima."
1.0,gojira,Legendary! That's all you need to know!
1.0,gojira,"Possibly the best monster movie made. Must have been chilling to see only 10 years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the anti-nuclear arms race message is much clearer in the original version."
1.0,gojira,"This is one of my favorite movies. A terrific anti-war film, one that could only have been made in postwar Japan. And, of course, it brought us the immortal character of Godzilla."
1.0,gojira,"A tense and terrifying monster movie, yes, but also a touching requiem for the horrors visited by World War II, and a call for nobility and self-sacrifice to return in the post-war age."
1.0,gojira,"The original, and best Godzilla is the most serious, dark and depressing of the series with an anti-war message that is as clear today as ever. Very strong characters and thought provoking writing lead this monster masterpiece."
1.0,gojira,My most favorite movie of all time. Not only is it about a giant monster destroying everything it also has a deep and inspiring message. To top it all off there's no Steve Martin. This started a life long obsession for these films.
1.0,gojira,Classic Japanese horror/sci-fi movie. I could sit through a 1000 of these things. I Love this stuff!
1.0,gojira,"Don't see Godzilla, see Gojira."
1.0,gojira,Perhaps the most misunderstood movie of all time. The Japanese version is without question a cinematic milestone.
1.0,gojira,"By far the best godzilla movie, especially the original japanese version without the american scenes in.Definately a defining moment in cinema history."
1.0,gojira,The original and best monster movie ever made.
1.0,gojira,Classics are the best not some movie remade over and over to make money...whom ever made this had something to get across to other people. obviously the attact on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But even in it seriousness still a great movie.
1.0,gojira,This movie pretty much changed my life. I like the original Japanese and Raymond Burr versions for different reasons.
1.0,gojira,"It's a classic and upon recent repeat viewings, an actual movie with characters and emotion and stuff. That was a nice surprise after watching every single other Godzilla movie."
1.0,gojira,Best Kaiju movie ever...hands down!
1.0,gojira,"The original Kaiju film as only Ishiro Honda could have told it. Here Godzilla is a tragic character, an animal who is trapped in a hostile world of technology that is not his own. Gojira is both an amazing and poignant film. That is, unless Raymond Burr comes around."
1.0,gojira,This is probably the best of all the Godzilla movies. I had to buy it when i saw the new DVD. This movie is too good for anyone to miss out on. It is a classic.
1.0,gojira,"The original Kaiju film as only Ishiro Honda could have told it. Here Godzilla is a tragic character, an animal who is trapped in a hostile world of technology that is not his own. Amazing and poignant. That is, unless Raymond Burr comes around."
1.0,gojira,"First-rate cinema, mainly due to Ishiro Honda's smart direction, Akira Ifukube's dread-filled score, and Eiji Tsubayara's special effects. Be sure to check the original Japanese cut and not the hacked up American version. The first Kaiju film is the most thoughtful and interesting."
1.0,gojira,This is the only version that should be viewed. The American version feels like a lobotomized abortion compared to the original Japanese cut.
1.0,gojira,One of the best monster movies.
1.0,gojira,"While I love the Raymond Burr version- and the many sequels- as camp fun, seeing this is like an epiphany. Who knew that a giant monster movie could be so profound, political and, yes, deep."
1.0,gojira,"Forget what you think you know about Godzilla movies, this is a beautiful anti-nuke film which really is king of the monsters. Timeless."
1.0,gojira,The original without Raymond Burr is an absolute masterpiece. What a way to symbolize the horror and destruction of the a-bomb after WWII. I highly recommend picking up the Special Anniversary Edition so that you can see both versions and (hopefully) agree with me. ^^
1.0,gojira,"The best Kaiju film ever, and I'm not jumping on the bandwagon when I say this. It truly is the greatest Kaiju eiga ever made. Don't believe me? Watch it and you'll see."
1.0,gojira,"I really recommend seeing the orgional film, it may defy expectations."
1.0,gojira,accept no imitations. the one and only gojira from the master of kaiju ishiro honda and toho studios
1.0,gojira,"I love the entire series to tell the truth, but the first installment is a nearly perfect bit of film and one of the best movies ever to come out of Japan."
1.0,gojira,The greatest Godzilla film of all time. And number 1 on my top ten list. Gojira is a classic monster film that gets way less credit than it deserves. A brilliant masterpiece in my eyes.
1.0,gojira,The embodiement of the feelings of horror and destruction of the atomic bomb in the form of a 30 story tall lizard.
1.0,gojira,If you can ignore the outdated special effects this is a great monster movie.
1.0,gojira,Japan has never escaped the shadow cast by the mushroom cloud. This is the embodiement of their terror. Not to be mistaken for the fluffier stuff that came later in the series.
1.0,gojira,"Best Godzilla movie ever, and a great allegory about nuclear weapons."
1.0,gojira,"This is a very good movie. Although it is a giant dinosaur, the Japanese know how to make a good monster movie. I can understand why this movie has a anti-nuke message, especially since the movie was released during the Cold War. I think this is a must see classic for everyone!"
1.0,gojira,"Godzilla is the greatest badass in monster history. Not even the Seventh Voyage of Sinbad dragon trumps the theme song and the radiation breath of this lizard. Sorry, Ray."
1.0,gojira,Amazing! I love this movie. YES!
1.0,gojira,one of the greats. all time classic must see monster film. next to king kong one of the most influential important films that few have seen. see the japanese version it truly is a masterpiece
1.0,gojira,the greatest monster film. original japanese version is the only version in my opinion. masterpiece
1.0,gojira,Original 1954 Japanese version of Godzilla without Raymond Burr present (but usa version is also included here). Ishiro Honda's film is a cinema classic.
1.0,gojira,"Somber, sad, haunting, and utterly essential. Really."
1.0,gojira,"The original ""Godzilla"" is still the best. An absolutely groundbreaking and revolutionary film, a monster movie with a message, it's somewhat cheapened by it's multitude of sequels."
1.0,gojira,"Far different from the Raymond Burr ""americanization"" an atomic allegory"
1.0,gojira,"The original Godzilla film was made as a horror film with symbolism to show the negative side to nuclear weapons, long before the campier and sillier films of the 60s and 70s."
1.0,gojira,One of the few horror movies that has a message that still has meaning.
1.0,gojira,Great film of iconic proportions
1.0,gojira,Finally we in the West can watch it without the American cut-ins and dub! Amazing film.
1.0,gojira,First and best. Ingore the man in suit and just watch the greatest film ever made in it full glory.
1.0,gojira,"The original, and still the best."
1.0,gojira,"Sort one of my favorite movies of all time. EVER. King Kong can bite my ass, at least Godzilla said something new, rather than ""it's beauty and the beast, but with GORILLAS and DINOSAURS""! I'll take socio-political commentary over flights of fantasy in at least THIS instance."
1.0,gojira,YEAH! Godzilla/Gojira rules either way! It's about time the original showed up on America's shores . . .
1.0,gojira,By far the greatest monster film ever created. This film does homage to the horror of the hydrogen bomb by artfully suggesting worldwide non-proliferation as the answer.
1.0,gojira,classic monster movie from Japan
1.0,gojira,Gojira (Godzilla) is far better than the American counterpart. I hope Toyo releases a restored version to DVD.
1.0,gojira,A true masterpiece on the horrors of war. Still relevent today. Don't be fooled by what you may have heard about Godzilla. Give this one a chance.
1.0,alien,"One Of My All-Time Favorite Movies.Alien Is Scary, Superbly Directed And Acted And Really Is That Movie That I Can Watch Again And Again And Still Love it. A Classic"

1.0,alien,"Esta peli es una obra maestra, se siente cre√≠ble en todo momento, a diferencia de la nueva entrega (Alien Covenant), nos presenta un espacio vac√≠o oscuro y sinuoso ideal para una pelicula de terror espacial."
1.0,alien,My fav movie of all time. This movie is so GREAT!!!!
1.0,alien,I love this movie. I saw it in 1982 when I was 11 (don't tell my Mom). I checked my closet every night for the next 7 years before getting into bed... The atmosphere and lighting was ground breaking. The later Alien movies are okay but can't match this.
1.0,alien,"In this thrilling movie, Ridley Scott effectively taps into our fears and keeps us on the edges of our seats every minute. The great score and camerawork only add to the electrifying horror of this classic."

1.0,alien,"One of my favorite movies ever. More horror than sci-fi, it worked on me partially due to my claustrophobia."

1.0,alien,One of the most innovative horror films ever made it's simply a masterpiece.
1.0,alien,"Great film. Classic. And with every Alien movie since, they haven't been able to recreate the atmosphere the first created."
1.0,alien,Classic science fiction/horror movie about the crew aboard a space cargo ship who stop to check out life forms its sensors detect. The chest scene is one of the most memorable scenes in cinematic history. Sigourney Weaver though is what makes this movie a classic I really love.
1.0,alien,"While its characters might be a bit lacking in depth, this hardly takes away from any of the spectacle of the perfect cinematography, set design, and surprisingly tight script and direction."
1.0,alien,"Still a fantastic science-fiction film, Alien is just a gory, fun, and even scary at parts experience. I still view this as one of the best science-fiction films ever made!"

1.0,alien,Best horror movie of all time. My favorite Sci fi
1.0,alien,"Re-watching all the Alien films with my son, in preparation for seeing Covenant (OK, so not the Aliens vs. Predator ones ...). This was just as scary and good as I remembered it, although some of the special effects are a big cringe worthy."
1.0,alien,Intrigue and suspense mesh beautifully in this classic sci-fi thriller from Ridley Scott.
1.0,alien,A true sci-fi classic.
1.0,alien,I love this movie. It shows the definition of horror and no one can hear you scream. The atmosphere feels terrifying with every character being picked off one by one. It gives jumpscares and enough suspence to keep you holdin the urge to use the bathroom in the theater.
1.0,alien,"Pel√≠cula que rompe de manera brutal con el terror, simplemente una gran obra del g√©nero del Terror, enmarcado en un contexto de ciencia ficci√≥n."
1.0,alien,"Visually breath-taking even now, this Ridley Scott masterpiece brings to life one of the seminal villains of filmmaking history with a masterful stroke. Instead of relying on gore to provide it's horror, suspense has you on the edge of your street even after it ends."
1.0,alien,"Slow, atmospheric and sublime. Will probably never be bested."
1.0,alien,"One of my all time Alien Classics, lol, Shut up, It's me all time Classic.An amazing adventure that rocketed me into the Alien/Sci-Fi realm."
1.0,alien,Great cult classic that relies on tension more than jump scares.
1.0,alien,"Arguably the best straight up sci-fi horror movie ever made, Alien is a slow burn that grabs you tight and doesn't let go until the credits roll. The acting, suspense, direction, musical score, and script are all top notch, and the film stays scary even after multiple viewings."
1.0,alien,"This is one of the best sci-fi horror film's of all time, the tension is on point with some of the scariest scenes put to screen."

1.0,alien,still holds up as one of the greatest films/horror films of all time.

1.0,alien,So people think Aliens is better than Alien? Really? Come on...
1.0,alien,"I loved the sequel but this is the original concept, characters. In addition, the design of the ship affected was dirty, gritty and that was a fresh approach to so many previous crafts. Loved this film."
1.0,alien,Sci-Fi and horror converging into a masterpiece!
1.0,alien,This movie is the best in science fiction. Ridley Scott in 1979 created a film with imagined technologies far beyond its time.

0.0,alien,"From the moment I turned this movie on I couldn't get into it. It was slow, had uninteresting characters and I didn't like the plot too much. It's more of a horror flick and I wasn't expecting that. The chest hugger scene was great though and allowed me to give this movie at least a star lol 1/5"

1.0,alien,"as a kid I almost couldn't sleep after watching this, now the addition of the maggot scene.... holy crickey."
1.0,alien,"Just as scary and atmospheric as the original. There are moments where it was understandable to remove some of the shots and extras, but there are also some scenes where it heightens the scariness of the scene and provides even more insight to the mysterious creature."

1.0,alien,Mastery of slow-building suspense. What makes this movie work so well is lack of information we are spoon fed. We are given the bare minimum of what we need to know about the alien; its motives and origins and it only makes it more terrifying.

1.0,alien,a must have un the colection
1.0,alien,One of the best suspense build ups of all time. And one of the best horror climaxes. Visceral and with great feminist undertones.

1.0,alien,"Alien is without a doubt one of the most influential Sci-fi films ever made-- up there with Star Wars, Blade Runner, and The Terminator. The performances are extraordinary, and the plot is highly refined. My only problem is that some plot points seem unnecessarily tacked on."
1.0,alien,One of the best horror movies ever made. I know a lot of people don't see this movie as a horror flick but just because it's set in space and is in the future is moot. The fact it makes you sit on the edge of your seat and jump at every turn is what mades it amazing.

1.0,dr_strangelove,M-F-O8.6[Stanley Kubrick]
1.0,dr_strangelove,"One of the best comedies of all time. It's hilarious, it's smart and it's incredibly quotable. It also stars Peter Sellers in three (!) roles, and he absolutely steals the show."
1.0,dr_strangelove,A funny and interesting piece of satire
1.0,dr_strangelove,"A pioneer of the dark comedy genre that is meant to befuddle the average and amuse the arrogantly intelligent. That being said, I am arrogantly intelligent."
1.0,dr_strangelove,Best comedy of all time.
1.0,dr_strangelove,"So realistic and valid to contemporaneity times when despots in the penchant for nuclear arms. Ludicrous to the highest degree, thus effective in the message, it wants to convey. If it's shown worldwide in 2017 that sure will make a universal upheaval against nuclear arms."
1.0,dr_strangelove,This film is a wonderfully directed and acted piece of art which brings comedy to a stressful situation. I can see why it is remembered and revered even to this Day.

1.0,dr_strangelove,Mein F√É 1/4hrer I can walk!
1.0,dr_strangelove,Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is a landmark achievement in filmmaking for director Stanley Kubrick. Dr. Strangelove's darkly funny theme is brilliantly captured by the master actor known as Peter Sellers.

1.0,dr_strangelove,Until I saw this movie I never knew how good of an actor Peter Sellers actually was.
0.0,dr_strangelove,""" Comedy"" that tries to make fun of communism without a single laugh. Aged badly."
1.0,dr_strangelove,"Considering Sellers was supposed to play MORE roles and the movie was entirely shot in three major rooms, Kubrick STILL delivers a pound-for-pound heavyweight in cinematography and the darkest of comedies. On my weekly ""must-watch"" list."

1.0,dr_strangelove,"It's simple, if you don't know every line by heart, you ain't."
1.0,dr_strangelove,Kubrick puts the cold war into a soup and sets the dish on fire. Egosentric madness with nuclear intentions. A cowboy riding a nuclear missle to a mutilated ex-nazi sub-third-reich wetdream planning. Razor sharp and brilliant.
1.0,dr_strangelove,Just the best satire. Some metaphors too.
1.0,dr_strangelove,Meu amor por este filme √© infinito.
1.0,dr_strangelove,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time, this movie is a great comical satire and has a great soundtrack too, like in every stanley kubrick movie. really good acting, really good cinematography."
1.0,dr_strangelove,"There isn't really much that can be said about Dr. Strangelove that hasn't already been said, or begins to tread into personal political projection.The benchmark for every modern satire. Unbelievably funny, and razor sharp in it's dissection of post WW2 American foreign policy."

1.0,dr_strangelove,"Probably the greatest black comedy of all time. Released at a time where the seriousness of the cold war and nuclear annihilation was at it's peak, he's able to turn the situation into a great satire. Kubrick's best work, and my personal favorite of his."

1.0,1003033-brazil,"Brazil is a combination of Orwellian, Kafkaesque, and Cyberpunk themes/aesthetics that creates a surreal experience, fudging the lines between film and dream, which is both bizarre and delightful. I would recommend it, just be sure to fill out you 27B/6 and sign your receipt."

1.0,1003033-brazil,"Brazil tickles the mind, portraying the entire film from the perspective of Jonathan Pryce's Sam Lowry.

1.0,1003033-brazil,"If I were to try to describe Brazil in only a few words, those words would consist of visceral, intense, sardonic, entertaining, and at times surreal.

1.0,1003033-brazil,An amazing visual feet. A chilling vision of the Orwell's 1984 mixed with a quirky sense of humor. Strange and surreal. The story of a man trapped in the gears of the bureaucratic machine trying to find his dream girl.
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Terry Gilliam's visionary Orwellian masterpiece is as unique as it gets. You really haven't seen anything quite like it! Odd, unusual, hilariously dark and full of mesmerizing visuals, it's a must see for all film lovers. Gilliam is a true artist!"
1.0,1003033-brazil,Brazil is like Monty Python in the future. It is that funny and good.
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Everything that a Terry Gilliam and a scifi film should be. However, Mr. Gilliam is not so great at dialogue. You will have to suffer through some of the clunkiest dialogue ever but its well worth it."
0.0,1003033-brazil,"Seen it, but I just don't understand what people like so much about it. I couldn't wait for it to finally end. Plus, Gilliam is a shit director who's made little more than Time Bandits..."
1.0,1003033-brazil,"One of my favorite films of all time. So surreal and hopeless and sweet. Even with the weak ending, it still had me wishing I could go back in time and see it again for the first time."
1.0,1003033-brazil,"If Phillip K. Dick and Douglas Adams wrote 1984 chances are it would look something like Brazil; Visually goregous, smartly written, just as funny as it horrifing, and as interesting as any dystopia I've ever seen."

1.0,1003033-brazil,Gilliam's masterpiece.
1.0,1003033-brazil,"One of my all-time favorite movies. A dark fantasy on many levels. One of my favorite playwrights, Tom Stoppard, helped Terry create a masterful script. The music and sound help carry the movies tense atmosphere. Don't bother with any version other than the final cut."
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Love that movie. Really reminded me of the book of George Orwell, 1984. i love how dark and criative are the visuals in this film, the acting is also great, everthing works. Simply an unique master piece."
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Terry Gilliam's dystopian comedy is something of a cross between A Clockwork Orange, Monty Python and Blade Runner.

1.0,1003033-brazil,This film should be shown to all of the vice deputy sub assistants working in human resource departments.
1.0,1003033-brazil,Dystopia at its best. The idea that red tape and paperwork can actually cause a man to dissapear is a prominent feature in the film. This is a great film. It has several different endings that were filmed and it is difficult to decide on a favorite.

1.0,1003033-brazil,"loosly based off the orwell novel 1984, set in somewhere in the 20th century, this fantasy is packed full of terry gilliam's imagitive storytelling and is a biting satire on 80s' indulgences such as cosmetic surgery. a wonderful film"
0.0,1003033-brazil,"INCREDIBLY OVERRATED. Yes, it's got some good imagery and makes some decent political/social statements and it even conjures a fair amount of thinking in the viewer. But it's just not worth it. The movie is so scattered and irritatingly surreal (and not in a good way either)."

1.0,1003033-brazil,"Completely surreal and dull at points, which caused me to strongly consider giving this a poor rating, but the intelligence behind this film wins overall."
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Director Terry Gilliam's Brazil captures its message of insane bureaucrats, surrealism, and insane dark humor to a tee. This movies way of showing how needlessly complicated we make things to supposedly make them easier is brilliant, and by far one of my favorites."
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Monty Python's take on 1984. If you like Orwell, you'll like this."
1.0,1003033-brazil,"Such a wonderfully weird film. Terry Gilliam is a master with visuals, and this is easily the one of the best things that he's ever done. It certainly hasn't aged either since its release 26 years ago. And hopefully, it'll continue to stand the test of time."

1.0,antz,"My favourite Pixar. Great story, intelligent, funny script, and well-chosen cast. Superb animation and memorable music score. A winner in every department."

1.0,antz,'Existentialism is an ANTism.' This has to be one of the best underrated 'kids' film ever. Holds WAY up.
0.0,antz,"When you would compare it to A bug's life, you would be dissapointed how much DreamWorks has copied from it. While a bug's life is childish and funny, Antz uses excessive idiocy to make people laugh. Truth to be told it does not deserve 95%. Good actors have wasted their talents on this film."
1.0,antz,"surprise, it's a cute movie"
1.0,antz,I love the story that the creators try to tell
0.0,antz,"Antz is a movie that takes it itself WAY too literally; and after a while, not only does it become boring, but annoying."
0.0,antz,"Just because there is a prolific director voiced a character, doesn't mean you should look past the actual plot and seriousness of the movie. Blatant rip off of A Bug's Life."

1.0,antz,Great social commentary. competing with pixar even during the beginning
0.0,antz,Slept through most of it.... and gladly!
1.0,antz,A very well executed animated film that has been forgotten.
1.0,antz,"Maybe not by much appealing in color and visual but in the flow of the story and the outstanding star power voices of the the cast, for sure the 'Antz' will certainly captivate you and your eyes to keep on watching..."
1.0,antz,Imagine A Bug's Life but with a better cast and a darker storyline. Brilliant stuff.

0.0,antz,"Should not be on top movies ever. Boring characters, decent plot, nasty animation."
1.0,antz,"In my opinion this is Dreamworks best film. Funny, mature and wonderfully animated, too bad Dreamworks would rather make films stuffed with pop culture references then this."
1.0,antz,love this film so much
0.0,antz,Hated it....probably because it came out the same year as A Bugs Life.
1.0,antz,"The movie's higher intelligence and advanced use of it's premise showcase DreamWork's penchant for non-catering, which makes it's thematics feel more admirable, if a little alienating, considering its time and mixed appeal."
1.0,antz,Woody Allen and Jennifer Lopez made this movie funny and clever. A great family movie for sure.
0.0,antz,This movie is terrible in every way and a horrible excuse for an animated film. The film reeks of Bug's Life knock-off and was poorly executed across the board.

1.0,1000085-2001_a_space_odyssey,"Contains some of the most powerful and moving scenes I've ever seen in a movie, has a landmark score, and really makes you think. What more do you need from a sci-fi? Sure, some scenes drag on for a little bit, but that's a small gripe in an otherwise perfect film."
1.0,1000085-2001_a_space_odyssey,Probably the most ambiguous yet beautiful and peaceful film I've ever seen.

0.0,1000085-2001_a_space_odyssey,"I don't know why so many people love this movie, I found it rather boring. It was like the author stared to write one story then got board with it, started writing something else didn't no where to go with it, So started writing a third dis-related story and weakly tried to tie them all together."
1.0,1000085-2001_a_space_odyssey,An unforgettable story that defines the sci-fi genre and bores the living crap out of people who are unable to appreciate its art
1.0,1000085-2001_a_space_odyssey,"The non plus ultra of the art of cinema. A philosophical tale, but a concrete stargate between film and reality."

1.0,1000085-2001_a_space_odyssey,This isn't a film. This is a spiritual journey and the second greatest film ever made.
1.0,1000085-2001_a_space_odyssey,Stanley Kubrick is a visionary! He graced us with this thought provoking work of art and one of the most influential films of all time that can not be understated.

0.0,1000085-2001_a_space_odyssey,I will never figure out how this is supposed to be one of the greatest sc-fi films of our time. You need to be on acid to make any kind of sense of this crap at all.

1.0,1000085-2001_a_space_odyssey,"One of the greatest films ever made...easily. 2001: A Space Odyssey is the ultimate film of hypothesis and the ultimate example of how meaning can be so much more impacting through imagery, rather than words."
0.0,1000085-2001_a_space_odyssey,The slowest movie I've ever attempted watching. I lost interest and patience before I could appreciate or finish the film.
1.0,1000085-2001_a_space_odyssey,Toujours aussi superbe et deroutant a regarder. Et c'est ce qui fait que ce film reste culte encore aujourd'hui.
1.0,1000085-2001_a_space_odyssey,A mindtwisting picture way ahead of its time. An all-time classic
1.0,1000085-2001_a_space_odyssey,2001: A Space Odyssey is a sheer meditative piece set in outer space. Kubrick uses light and sound in a way that I haven't seen before in a feature film and may be I'll not in the future either. It's a great film and one that needs to be treasured.
1.0,1000085-2001_a_space_odyssey,My seventh favorite movie of all time.

1.0,arrival_2016,"It might not seem like much, but ends up delivering much more than expected. Complies and goes that extra mile sci Fi is meant to accomplish. It is a ""must"" (a very enjoyable and EMOTIOnal one) for all sci Fi true lovers."
1.0,arrival_2016,"A near-perfect movie that deals with science, humanity, warfare, family, and the concept of time, but ultimately leaves the question of life and its meaning to the audience. If laser guns against monster aliens are your thing, go see ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" instead."
1.0,arrival_2016,Nothing like a good Ol' fashioned alien movie to make you appreciate your family.
1.0,arrival_2016,Best ever!! Let's your brain fell useful.

1.0,arrival_2016,What a wonderful film. I was a bit confused at the beginning but my confusion was cleared up by the ending. This is by far the best Science Fiction is recent years. Highly recommend for any one who likes a thought provoking story instead of the special effect driven crap that we usually get.
0.0,arrival_2016,Good cast. Horrible movie. Couldn't understand half of the dialog. Long periods of no dialogue at all. Totally confusing. Kept using previous scenes. Don't waste your time.
1.0,arrival_2016,"I gave this movie 5 stars and it definitely deserves it. When the end came around, it gave the movie a whole new spin! This is a movie I could watch over and over again. I highly recommend it!"

1.0,arrival_2016,"An absolutely excellent film. I went in with no expectations and was blown away by the mood, concepts and the captivating central character."
1.0,arrival_2016,"Finally saw this. Had seen some negative reviews which kind kept me from watching it. Honestly may be my favorite 2016 movie now. Definitely not an action movie, but such a smart thoughtful experience from beginning to end."

0.0,arrival_2016,"So...""Arrival"" was basically the 2007 Sandra Bullock movie ""Premonition"" combined with ""Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind."" Cinematically, it was pretty. Story/Plot-wise, it was predictable and boring. I fell asleep watching it."
1.0,arrival_2016,Good for what ails us right now

1.0,arrival_2016,"Amazing movie, exactly what I want from sci-fi"
0.0,arrival_2016,"Worst movie since ET. Amy Adams is helpless and hopeless. People act in completely unrealistic ways that make no sense. ""Then a miracle occurs"" is the premise of the move."
1.0,arrival_2016,"Made me think. The ideas were intriguing, and there was kind of a plot twist / surprise in the end. A little formulaic about the reactionary nature of humans (or maybe just realistic). I loved the idea that time is nonlinear. And I want to meet those aliens!"
1.0,arrival_2016,Very well done. Amy Adams is perfect. Best Sci-fi movie since Contact.
1.0,arrival_2016,Give it all the praise!!! Amazing movie
1.0,arrival_2016,"Both Villenveuve and Adams are at their best here. Visually and emotionally stunning. I am, and always will be, dumbfounded that Adams did not receive more recognition for her role in bringing this story to life. The character work and use of misdirection is peak storytelling."
1.0,arrival_2016,WOW this is truly a SFX masterpiece!!
1.0,arrival_2016,"A smart, expertly paced and acted sci-fi thriller. Arrival, once again, proves director Denis Villenueve is one of the modern masters of our time.5/5 stars"

1.0,arrival_2016,Great acting and a great story! The plot twist at the end is one of the best I've seen in a long time! A must see for Sci Fi fans!
1.0,arrival_2016,This is a special movie. It's not an action movie. It's not a thriller. Its not singular. It's nothing so pigeon-holed. It's f-ing smart. It's beautiful. It's masterfully crafted. Stop reading this. Go watch it.
1.0,arrival_2016,Imagine the thrill of Close Encounters combined with the awe and wonder of 2001 A Space Odyssey. Director Dennis Villeneuve and Writer Eric Heisserer are now at the top of my list of favorite directors and writers.
1.0,arrival_2016,Sublime. Perfectly executed and a fascinating look at perceptions if reality.
1.0,arrival_2016,"I am generally not a fan of science fiction or thrillers, but Amy Adams successfully helms this excellent film that questions our pre-conceived notions of what science fiction really can be."

0.0,arrival_2016,"What a waste of my time, confusing and utterly stupid. WTF is what came to mind at the end. I only watched all of the movie waiting for something to tie together, never did. Had lots of questions that were never answered, just like tv show Lost."
1.0,arrival_2016,I think this is a beautiful movie
1.0,arrival_2016,A well-executed science fiction thriller that also carries a thought-provoking concept down to its structural core.
0.0,arrival_2016,"Best movie by far to fall asleep to! Other than that...overrated, boring, and nothing special. Wish I never saw this movie. What a waste of time and money."
1.0,arrival_2016,Enjoyable sci-fi quasi-thriller with some familiar themes from Contact.
1.0,arrival_2016,"Incredibly powerful movie, a true ""statement of the human condition"".This story is a Shakespearean Tragedy masquerading as a sci-fi movie. That it didn't win multiple academy awards is shameful."
0.0,arrival_2016,Normally I agree with the tomatometer and audience score. I found this the most boring movie I have seen in a long time. I actually watched it to the end in the hope that it would redeem itself but no luck on that front.
1.0,arrival_2016,my favorite film <3
0.0,arrival_2016,"Incredibly pretentious. This is a ""chick flick"" disguised as sifi. The style is ridiculously slow. The concept of the aliens was very good, but the interesting part of the movie, how to understand language was skipped over. Silly movie how it got 94% ratings from the pros is a head scratcher."
1.0,arrival_2016,"Thoughtful, emotional and very moving. Something we all think about but can't quite fathom the logistics of meeting intelligent life outside of our own. Amy Adams shines."
1.0,arrival_2016,"Loved this movie, the plot was so brilliant and i feel like it desserved more awards."
1.0,arrival_2016,An absurdly good contact movie made with believe communication and an incredibly dense plot. One you'll want to pay very close attention to.
1.0,arrival_2016,Inspiring! Stunning sound effects.
1.0,arrival_2016,For once a symbolic story that goes against the typical vilified alien invasion type plot. A beautiful message linking advance communication and precognition skills. One of the most emotionally driven sci-fi movies of all time.

1.0,arrival_2016,Amazing. This movie is so innovative and interesting. The story and plot line are creative.
1.0,arrival_2016,One of my favourite movies of all time. Amazing. Moving.
0.0,arrival_2016,"I liked the timing and the main topic of the movie. But, the movie proceeds so slowly until the point that it was driving me crazy. I think the exact same plot with exact same acting quality could be done, half the time that this movie took (which is 111 minutes)."
0.0,arrival_2016,"The more I reflect on it, the worse it gets."
1.0,arrival_2016,"This movie is a masterpiece. Every line and every scene is significant and very well though/planned out. The subject matter was brilliant as well, communication...it shines a light on just how complicated it is. This is the best movie I have seen in recent memory."

1.0,arrival_2016,Fantastic. A Must see.
1.0,arrival_2016,"Arrival is something different to the other sci-fi movies, it¬¥s more focus on comunication and inteligence of the humans than the aliens. Amy Adams is amazing so as the story that it will blow your mind at the third act of the movie"

0.0,arrival_2016,Not sure how this show got 93%! Was all excited to see it and boy was it a waste of time. First 45 minutes shear boredom. It was so dark I could hardly see each scene. Could have been so much better. Wish I could get me money back. Human Human Human ink blot ink blot octopus are now aliens!
1.0,arrival_2016,"A really good movie. Im a smart person but I don't know if I'm smart enough for this movie. I really liked it, not one I'll buy but one I'll watch when ever its on to try and better understand it."
1.0,arrival_2016,A tour-de-force. Equally riveting and revitalizing as it is meditative and poetic in its exploration of humanity.
0.0,arrival_2016,This was easily the worst movie I have seen in a while. The boring drawn out plot that had such a poor careless ending. I literally would put this movie on any time you're having insomnia as it is guaranteed to remedy that issue. It only deserves 93% as sleeping medicine. Absolutely awful flim
1.0,arrival_2016,"One of the most underated movies of 2016. An amazing original story, great cast and cinematography. But the music waa on another level. The actors did not have to speak, the music told the whole story."
0.0,arrival_2016,"One of the most boring ""aliens come to earth"" movies I have ever seen. The plot is also implausible and forced. Other than some of the visual effects, the film is unwatchable."
1.0,arrival_2016,"Simply marvelous. Excellent script, actors, everything was amazing"
1.0,arrival_2016,It's not really a complex movie it's pretty easy to understand...it's just meh. Starts strong then gets a tad slow for a hour then gets going last 20 mins. Not really a great story but does make you think about what if you knew your future.
1.0,arrival_2016,Smart sci-fi for adults.
0.0,arrival_2016,Quit possibly one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time
1.0,arrival_2016,Never thought I'd see a movie so thoughtful about Squid aliens and language. But I couldn't be happier about it.
1.0,arrival_2016,A total tear jerker!
1.0,arrival_2016,"Though you will see plenty of nods to past sci fi films and plenty of re-hashed themes, Arrival amply creates an amazing thought provoking sci fi with human morality. Amy Adams is on top of her game once again and once you fully grasp the film and its heady concept, you will be blown away."

0.0,arrival_2016,"Still unsure what I just watched. Their really was nothing to gain from watching this film. Spider aliens come to Earth, one person figures out how to communicate with the aliens within days, the aliens already know English, and they leave. Oh and they get married. Waste of time."

0.0,arrival_2016,Nothing happens. Aliens come to save humanity in hopes that one day humanity will save them. One woman is the key and saves both. Aliens leave. The end. No action. Incredibly slow. Nothing to engage the audience. Would never recommend to anyone.
1.0,arrival_2016,"Arrival is a highly inspiring movie, setting up the topic of extraterrestrial visitors from a whole different point of view. The intelligent storyline and a tense yet not overly thrilling narrative make this movie a great sci-fi experience."

1.0,arrival_2016,Intelligent sci-fi. Amy Adams is a national treasure.

1.0,arrival_2016,The GOOD movie from 2016 about Amy Adams and aliens the government doesn't quite trust. Arrival is smart and stays smart all the way to the end rather than just turning into a CGI action movie in the third act like a lesser movie would have. The twist is great and it makes you think.
1.0,arrival_2016,"Wow... this movie was basically perfect for me. Great sci fi (my writing passion), linguistics (my education), smart story, & an almost gut wrenching finale when the truth comes together & my mouth is left gaping from the mind-blowing outcome. Phenomenal movie."

1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Immediately iconic, Boris Karloff is amazing, Frankenstein is the greatest of the Universal Monsters."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Despite being in someways radically different from the book, Frankenstein the movie, is still able to hold it's own against the critically acclaimed novel, whilst both complimenting and changing the source material to it's particular needs and specifications."

1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Boris Karloff will always be the best movie monster of all time, and has set the stage for many inspirations to come in the decades! A cinematic masterpiece from beginning to end!"
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Frankenstein is stylized, dark, and a highly influential piece of cinema. It does stray much from Shelley's original vision, but it also creates an unforgettable story full of haunting images."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Colin Clive's mad performance and the legendary Boris Karloff dominate this classic. It's a shame that Clive died so young. His nuanced performance, alongside the moody but innocent Karloff, make this a genre standout that is imitated even today."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Still a FANTASTIC Film! While maybe not the scariest film I've seen (back then it was!), but the film is well-acted, has a good story showing the monster is not really bad but just misunderstood, good pacing and is just a classic!"

1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Iconic horror film, dated but still impressive."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,A disturbing bet yet eye opening film of what happens when man himself decides to become the creator instead of letting nature take it's normal route.

1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Deviating from the novel, which is my favorite of the Victorian era, the fact that it was concocted by a group of simple Hollywood marketers is quite apparent. I new it would be campy, but I think that aspect made it funner to watch."

1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Frankenstein is my favorite classic horror series. Boris Karloff is the perfect actor to play the monster. In the end I really end up feeling bad for him b/c he tries so hard to fit in nobody accepts him.

1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"The finest horror film ever made. James Whale is a great director. And Karloff, what an amazing, talented actor. He is responsible for the worlds greatest horror icon."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"IMO, it's still the greatest! It's so iconic and has impacted every good horror director. The monster is loose!"

1.0,1007818-frankenstein,James Whale's masterful adaptation of Shelley's tale of family tragedy and science gone wrong. Not quite DRACULA but one of Universal's horror lynchpins.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Boris Karloff! Classic
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,A horror film classic!!!! This is my favorite Universal Monster.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Boris Karloff is amazing in this film as the not-so-gentle giant. An all-time classic.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"A materpiece. From Boris Karloff's brilliant pantomime to Colin Clive's manic jadeness this is a classic. The production design, from the expressionist motifs to the legendary laboratory are iconic."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,A classic for a reason.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Karloff is once again amazing and doesn't utter a complete sentence in the film. Wonder what it would have been like if Lugosi had not turned down the roll of the Monster?????
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Still stands the test of time
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Hollywood has made some really, really great films: Casablanca, this...I'm sure there are others."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Universal did no wrong in the '30s and '40s when it came to monster movies.

1.0,1007818-frankenstein,This is the very best of the Universal Monsters era...the golden age of horror ghouls. I love Frank!
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"OK, this had NOTHING to do with the book, but broke new ground, regardless."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Dear lord!! There is something about this movie that gets me. Older horror movies, with the grainy dark black and white cinematography, always have that particular creepy thing going for them and this is the one that REALLY took it home. It still is creepy today IMO."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,I am a big fan of the classics and this is one of my faves.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,possibly the greatest horror movie of all time. karloff was the mannn.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"A perfect horror film, even if it's dated. Man playing God is never good. Clive is just about the worst parent in film history, and Karloff's performance is probably as great as any I've seen."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,the original frankenstein film rules
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"An absolute wonder! It may not be all that faithful to Mary Shelly's gothic tome, but it's iconic nonetheless. Karloff is extraordinary, you'll feast on the cinematic wizardry on display."
1.0,blade_runner,√ìtimo filme com o futuro sombrio que viria a influenciar muitos outros filmes nos anos seguintes. A hist√≥ria √© um tanto confusa no in√≠cio e o ambiente eternamente √∫mido cansa um pouco pelo filme ser longo.

1.0,blade_runner,"For 1982, this visuals are mindblowing, but one theory remains. Is Roy a replicant? In the final version, it's clear that Roy isn't, but in the director's version, it's clear he is. If I had to pick which version to go with, i'd say the director's."

1.0,blade_runner,"Classic sci-fi movie that pulls all the right punches, this is one of those movies that should be viewed twice: The original cut followed immediately by the director's cut. A dark, dismal view of the future with Rutger Hauer chasing you through a building is a fun ride, to me."

1.0,blade_runner,Full review coming soon.
1.0,blade_runner,I picked up a copy of the 2007 'Final Cut' of this magnificent film. It is even more hauntingly beautiful than I remember the original theatrical release and the first Director's Cut. Worth owning the Blu Ray!
1.0,blade_runner,Fascinated by the world created entirely on film. Characters remain memorable forever. Doesn't hurt to have been a H Ford fan to begin with.
1.0,blade_runner,"Few movies get better the more you watch them. This is one of them. A cult classic, which didn't fare well at the time of it's theatrical release, because it was way ahead of it's time. Today, it is seen as a great movie."

1.0,blade_runner,still such a iconic 80s sci-fi classic watched the final cut but I still prefer the original version it had a better ending/editing
1.0,blade_runner,this is a a wonderful movie and i just had a few thoughts as to what caused it to be a great movie. i believe the actors they had for the part were perfect for the role they played. the ending is confusing and hard to understand thought.

1.0,blade_runner,"One of the few times that Ridley Scott's visual sensibilities meshed seamlessly with the screenplay. For the inventive Science-Fiction/Noir style it needs to be remembered, for the narrative and intriguing ideas it deserves to be constantly revisited."
1.0,blade_runner,great movie with a great performance from harrison ford in his iconic role although since i watched the final cut it was slightly more confusing
1.0,blade_runner,This and Aliens are my fav two sci-fi films of ALL time!
1.0,blade_runner,The music by Vangelis and the gorgeous cinematography of Jordan Cronenweth are the highlights of this film.
1.0,blade_runner,"One of the greatest sic-fi flicks of all time, if not the greatest. This film really discusses the issue of being human, and in the end it makes it's statement when the replicant saves the life of the human trying to kill him, proving who is more humane."
1.0,repo_man,My favorite movie ever.
1.0,repo_man,"One could say this movie is many genres and things jumbled up into one. Whatever it is, it definitely isn't boring. This movie is one of the most random, cooky, and outlandish out there. But it's great. It covers a lot of important themes."
1.0,repo_man,"Characters that jump off of the screen. A plot so far fetched that even the most serious of watchers will crack a smile. Off the wall, exciting, and with killer tunes to boot. You'll be eager to grab a white and blue beverage after the show. A cult classic!"
1.0,repo_man,An all time great film..... watching it again out of respect for Harry Dean Stanton.
1.0,repo_man,Classic cult film. The life of a repo man is always intense!

0.0,repo_man,One of the dumbest movies I've ever seen. I don't know why I even watched it to the end?
0.0,repo_man,"Although toted by many as a classic, this film does not leave anything other than two questions; How and why was this made?"
0.0,repo_man,I'll just say outright that I don't get this film. It has a somewhat decent scifi premise but only a few scenes expand on this. Mostly this is just bad comedy bits and other bits of nonsense strung together. I was not a fan.
0.0,repo_man,11/26/2015: Not a good movie. The acting and story were both pretty bad. I don't understand the high scores.
1.0,repo_man,"Alex Cox was mildly Godardian. This and the Sid Vicious biopic, Sid & Nancy, were really quite wonderful and then nothing. Repo Man was insanely watchable, though, and once you've seen it it's nothing you'll ever forget."
1.0,repo_man,"A film that defies any rules for filmmaking, it seems. It is such a thoroughly bright, original, and unexpected work that it remains unmatched by any for the title of ultimate cult classic."

1.0,repo_man,Great movie. Emilio Esteveez is utterly believable as the young punk who ends up working in system.
0.0,repo_man,Whoever came up with this storyline had no imagination.
1.0,repo_man,Quirky film about an aloof punk-rocker who accidentally becomes an auto reposseser. They actually manage to fit in a whole subplot about aliens somewhere in the mix. many memorable lines and moments of intentional camp make this a bizzare classic.
1.0,repo_man,It all about the junk in your trunk
1.0,repo_man,"Zeitgeist of the cool and disaffected. Still perhaps the best movie soundtrack ever assembled. Oddly Emilio's best work. Monkey father of MTV creation, it should be noted."

1.0,repo_man,"Otto is a suburban L.A. punk who accepts a job as a repo man and finds himself embroiled in a wild plot involving a '64 Chevy Malibu, the CIA, and a dead Alien. This movie has a vicious sense of humor aimed straight at the jugular of the Reagan era. The greatest punk soundtrack ever compiled."
1.0,repo_man,"My favorite cult classic ever! It's a cool film, with only one boring scene. It's plot is all twisted around from stealing cars, to deadly alien inventions. It's jokes are also hilarious. Overall, I recommend this to anyone."
1.0,repo_man,Excellent cult film!
1.0,repo_man,Repo Man probably does not compute for many folks...it is a surreal story about Southern California in the 1980's so may have too much subcultural specificity....Also you need to like Punk Rock...
1.0,repo_man,Funky 80's classiic with a confused yet extremely sexy Emilio Estevez

1.0,repo_man,"Such a strange little film. But every aspect it tries to incorporate really works. The sci-fi element is good, there is a lot of funny lines and scenes, Harry Dean Stanton is great, Emilio is great...worth a look if you can handle strange films."
1.0,repo_man,"Crazy flick, totaly worth checking out"
0.0,repo_man,"When you hear this called a ""cult classic,"" think ""crap movie."" Probably only good if you're stoned or creatively chemically modified, it sure didn't improve with more beer."
1.0,repo_man,My favorite thing about this movie is that it goes EVERYWHERE. From drug use to punk rock to gang wars to car chases and even to ALIENS...this movie is packed to the brim with variety. It's got everything. And the reason why it's perfect is because it does it all PERFECTLY.
0.0,repo_man,"This movie sucks worse than an industrial strength vacuum cleaner. Never trust any movie that is referred to as ""cult"". It's code for ""crap"". To say it's crap is an insult to excrement!  One or two good one-lines though - but that's it."
1.0,repo_man,"Genius from beginning to end. A cynical punk hooks up a cynical older repo man who teaches him ""the repo code"". Basically it involves car chases, stealing people's cars, snorting speed and other fun stuff. Great 80's punk soundtrack and lots of bizarre humor with a great cast."
0.0,repo_man,"Towards the end of the movie, I said ""If that car starts flying, I'm going to punch myself in the face!"" Well...the car started flying..."

1.0,repo_man,Indescribable. Just amazing in every way.
1.0,repo_man,My fave film ever. Alex Cox came up with teh idea for the film whilst renting a flat with a guy who was a Repo man. They also shot a lot of it on the streets of L.A without permission...Classic!

1.0,repo_man,"Holy crap, this movie is so amazing that it cannot be believed. Any movie with Harry Dean Stanton in it is worth watching, but this movie completely defied my expectations. The opening and closing scenes are probably the best opening and closing scenes of any movie . . . EVER!"
1.0,repo_man,"One of my all-time favourites. Black sci-fi punk comedy that is totally original. And funny! Overlooked upon initial release, the film has attracted a cult and has inspired a generation of filmmakers."

1.0,repo_man,"It seems only a select initiated have both seen and dig this one. The world's clearly full of assholes, otherwise."
1.0,repo_man,"a movie before its time, or, a movie that gave birth to a generation of the best kept secrets."
1.0,repo_man,This is a classic movie. Emilio Estevez and Harry Dean Stanton are awesome in this movie. The fact that you never see what is inside the trunk is a great move. The X-Ray evaporation deaths that leave the smoking shoes is legendary. And the end....Classic.

1.0,repo_man,This movie is strange but good
1.0,repo_man,So many factors make Repo Man such a great flix. It's Emilio Estevez best film; Harry Dean Stanton is a riot and it has one of the best soundtrax going from the Iggy Pop to the Juicy Banana..Repo Man's always intense; one of my favorites now let's go get a drink
1.0,repo_man,the film that got me into Hardcore. I still have the original soundtrack cassette! surreal... the film that probably touched a young Tarantino.....

1.0,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_return_of_the_king,"Mr. Jackson, you have created a masterpiece in film-making that will stay as timeless as the epic itself.

1.0,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_return_of_the_king,I loved it! :P :P :P
1.0,children_of_men,Wonderful. Has everything one would want in a movie.
1.0,children_of_men,a masterpiece showing the full range of emotion on film. the bleakness is an amazing backdrop for a journey of personal redemption.I love how the world isn't overexplained. elements of it come through in passing
1.0,children_of_men,Master film-making. This movie got me to start watching movies in the theater again. Kudos in every notion. Tears of joy at the end. Thank you Universal.
1.0,children_of_men,"One of the best films I have ever seen. The performances, the cinematography, the story. Everything is rich with color in this dystopian sci-fi thriller. Definitely worth a watch."
1.0,children_of_men,"Maybe the film with the greatest cinematography ever made. In addition to being a phenomenally well written, directed and acted dystopian social spectacle. A film that should be considered one of the best and will be more widely appreciated in the future."
1.0,children_of_men,"There is a lot that can be said of the greatness of Children of Men, but it is that it begs us to understand the importance of children in that without them we have no future."
1.0,children_of_men,"From the documentary style and wildly imaginative writing, you can feel the sickness and the depravity of the world, the constant war and danger, but the implications it hints at are sophisticated and relevant for the foreseeable future and has the most profound impact."
0.0,children_of_men,Is an absurd movie...
1.0,children_of_men,"A terrific movie. It's rather a stretch to call it scifi, but I suppose because of the future setting, and the scientific nature of the problem, it counts as such. But it side steps all of the tropes. Clive Owen gives the performance of his career."
1.0,children_of_men,"This very realistic and quite possibly prophetic drama featuring plenty of suspense, action and intelligent dialogue raises many important political and humanist related questions that are more relevant today then ever before."
0.0,children_of_men,Waited 11 year to get round to watch this and thought it was awful
1.0,children_of_men,"*****Grim, bleak, and yet at its centre full of hope. 'Children of Men' is a fantastic, if sometimes depressing, look into the future, with an amazing performance by Clive Owen and astounding visuals. Highly overlooked."
0.0,children_of_men,"It's reviews like this that have caused me to lose faith in RT. This movie was barely B grade. Terrible acting, plot was interesting but didn't progress or have any substance. Little character development. Anticlimactic and the ending was a disappointment. Don't waste your time."
1.0,children_of_men,"A bit hard to follow, but after reading, fantastic plot, great political thriller and scary relavent for today"

1.0,children_of_men,"Children of men is equal parts thrilling, haunting, human, bleak and beautiful, and it is by far and away one of the best movies of the 2010's."
1.0,children_of_men,An eerily prophetic and emotionally devastating picture that stands to become a beacon of originality in the annals of cinema. Definitive and essential.
1.0,children_of_men,"So raw, so real, and incredibly intense. A believable future in chaos."
1.0,children_of_men,"Visually stunning, ""Children of Men"" counts with amazing performances and a masterful direction, its final act left me without words and made me tear up in a reflection about what humanity and hope is. Truly a modern sci-fi master piece."
1.0,children_of_men,"OMG...what can I say, from horrific to sublime. I've known about this film since it came out and heard all the praise heaped on it. But, my eyes are so red. Maybe I'll finish this some other time."
1.0,children_of_men,"Amazingly awesome, a perfectly made film. The single shot battle sequences are jaw-dropping, and after the first 20 minutes you're completely hooked on the story."
1.0,children_of_men,"In my nearly 50 years, this is definitely one of the top 10 movies I have seen. I did not see it until 9 years after it came out. It seems now quite prescient."
0.0,children_of_men,This movie is boring and full of nonsense talking. Stopped movie after 40 mins watching both me and my sister think it's bad. I don't know who can like this stupid movie

1.0,children_of_men,"Mucho mucho good, Alfonso."
1.0,children_of_men,"The final battle scene, apparently shot with one camera, twisting and turning and climbing, is worth 4 stars alone. A beautiful, powerful, thought provoking masterpiece."
1.0,children_of_men,"So much symbolism, so much complexity, so many emotional scenes and so many great shots! This is as perfect as a movie gets. I cannot say I found many faults with this because I was too busy looking at this beautiful film truly a masterpiece"
1.0,children_of_men,A masterpiece. Buttressed by the fact that it is even still astonishingly and eerily relevant today.
1.0,children_of_men,"Showcasing powerful cinematography of Emmanuel Lubeski and benefiting from Alfonso Cuarons' confident direction, Children of Men offers an unforgettable cinematic experience."
1.0,children_of_men,"Suspenseful, action-packed and superbly acted and shot dystopian thriller with an amazing cast that will leave a lasting impression on you long after the credits roll."
1.0,children_of_men,"There's none of the labored exposition these types of dystopian thrillers usually have and Cuaron packs every frame with details that slowly reveal a complex world outside of the main plot. It's also tremendously moving, because the film has the perfect balance of cynicism and hope."
1.0,children_of_men,"After seeing this movie several times over the years, I can safely say, ""I think that Children of Men is one of the greatest films ever made."""
1.0,children_of_men,"One of the most poignant films I've seen - a unique work of heartbreaking beauty.

1.0,children_of_men,"All around great film. Very intense, very beautiful. I'll be thinking about this one for a while."
1.0,children_of_men,It's grounded in a reality that's so depressing yet beautiful. Hope leaves in this masterpiece.
1.0,children_of_men,Children of Men is the best film of 2006 and one of the best science fiction films that have been made. Alfonso Cuaron makes his masterpiece.
1.0,children_of_men,It bothered me so good.
1.0,children_of_men,"Excellent Movie! Excellent direction, acting, cinematography and visuals. A must see for the biggest movie lovers."
1.0,children_of_men,"I am a huge fan of Sci Fi films, this movie easily makes the place of MY TOP 5 Greatest Sci Fi films EVER!!! If you haven't seen it, you would have to be completely mental not to!!!"
1.0,children_of_men,confusing at times but an unexpected film
1.0,children_of_men,"It marks the date when Children of Men is one of the least of Sci-fi and human story with magnifying concept of peace. Every blink is a wasting, Children of Men should be watched before you reach your peaceful sleep."
1.0,children_of_men,"Literally, the best movie of all time."
1.0,children_of_men,"A good post-apocalyptic script, lives the classic ""in the future we're all dead"" spirit. Gives a peek at what music will be like in 2020 as well. I'm excited."
1.0,children_of_men,I watch this movie every Christmas. The perfect picture of hope against the backdrop of despair.

1.0,children_of_men,What an exceptional film. Pretty scary look at the future.
1.0,children_of_men,Very good movie. Harsh times really reveal who you are. With no law or control you can choose to be hero or monster
1.0,children_of_men,A fascinating possibility of the future. Worth seeing simply for the messages it sends.
1.0,children_of_men,"Owen, Moore, Caine . . . what more can I ask for in a cast. The film's cinematography is eerily beautiful and the range of emotions it elicits is sometimes overwhelmingly. I could not help but think that were this event to happen, this could very likely be the outcome."
1.0,children_of_men,"Beautiful, powerful and emotional filmmaking rarely happens nowerdays, but when you put Alfonson Cuaron ast he director then that is exactly what you'll get."
1.0,children_of_men,One of the finest sci-fis of the past 10 years and quite possibly the best shot. Cuaron stages unbelievably long continuous takes that are mind-boggling in their complexity. The car chase sequence in the first act alone (featuring the intangible camera) is worth the price of admission.
1.0,children_of_men,"I missed the begining, so hoping it will show up again on HBO soon, but I really liked what I did see."
1.0,children_of_men,Just saw it again. This movie is a fucking masterpiece!

1.0,children_of_men,One of the greatest achievements in the history of film making
0.0,children_of_men,The Futuristic part was ok but the story really wasn't that good....or maybe it was the acting....ok they were both bad!
1.0,children_of_men,"A striking and disturbing real world look at real world problems. Cuaron masterfully creates a universe that is more fact than fiction. The sublime talent and chemistry between Cane, Owen and Moore only make it seem all that more genuine."
0.0,children_of_men,despite a good cast this one is as dead as the human race is in it.
0.0,children_of_men,They said it couldn't happen again they were SO wrong.Children Of Men + Clive Owen = 911 x 2536Why cant i put minus stars?

1.0,children_of_men,"Great for any film fan. The long sequences are truly amazing, and extremely difficult to pull off with the quality that Alfonso Cuaron did. A movie you MUST see, for its technical superiority and its thought-provoking story."
1.0,children_of_men,Awesome movie. Action packed & thought provoking.
1.0,children_of_men,"Dear car chases, film yourselves more like the one in this movie. Also, Science fiction movies, be more deep like this movie too."
1.0,children_of_men,"Terrific. Stunning. Everything about this movie worked. Especially the cinematography. This is the movie that I would show to possible new friends. If they didn't like or at least appreciate the amazing long take uprising scene, I would kill them on the spot. That's how amazing this movie is."

1.0,empire_strikes_back,Great follow up to A New Hope. Lots of great scenes and lines. Humour is spot on once again. Boba Fett is a cool addition. Great sequence at the end between Luke and Darth Vader. And of course there's the mother of all plot twists!

0.0,empire_strikes_back,This movie is bad because no military strategist would ever land troops on a planet like Hoth. You would just bomb the surface or destroy the entire planet and boom you have the end of that line of the story. A logical and much more likely outcome.
1.0,empire_strikes_back,"The best of the series. Darker than its predecessor, but even more enjoyable. Right from the start with the AT-ATs at the Battle of hoth it shows tremendous ambition. Darth Vader is a fantastic villain and the tooing and frowing between Leia and Solo adds some decent comedy"

1.0,1000617-aliens,"Awesome!! James Cameron has a gift for making the 2nd movie as good or better than the first. Aliens has a lot more action than Alien, which used tension and pace to build the fear. They are both amazing in their own regards. Aliens is loaded with action."

1.0,1000617-aliens,"Strong women, fierce creatures, slimy corporations, cute kids, terrifying horror, tense drama, explosive action, and belief-suspending science fiction: There is no other movie like it on earth or Acheron (LV-426)."

1.0,1000617-aliens,One of the best movies ever made. Almost as good as Blade Runner. Need I say more?
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Easily one of the best James Cameron movies. With fantastic action, this is one badass thrill ride. This and Terminator 2 prove why Cameron is the god of action sequences."

1.0,1000617-aliens,"Hard to find fault in this film, by far the strongest in the franchise. It's just another example of James Cameron being a master of sci fi action pictures. It's got a great storyline great cast and great visual effects. It's the one Alien film you can watch over and over."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"More of an sci-fi action flick than a sci-fi horror flick like it's predecessor, Aliens delivers an explosion of thrills that improves on the ideas of the first film."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Filled with great performances, gorgeous direction, and exhilarating action, Aliens is still one of the greatest Sci-Fi films ever made."
1.0,1000617-aliens,I would love to see a new one of this caliber!!!!
1.0,1000617-aliens,A superior action sequel better than than the first.
1.0,1000617-aliens,My one comment on this movie is as follows... take down Gene Siskel's lackadaisical attempt at writing a review on this timeless masterpiece.
1.0,1000617-aliens,One of the greatest films of all time.
1.0,1000617-aliens,Awesome sci fi horror movie!
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Aliens is one of the rare sequels that is even better than the original. By taking everything such as the masterful execution of suspense and character development, Aliens transcends being just a horror thriller but also a great action and drama movie as well."
0.0,1000617-aliens,"This is a very hard movie to get through, reminded me a lot of Avatar. How can this be that big a drop in quality from the original."
1.0,1000617-aliens,A great sequel to a ground breaking film! Riply is the most bad ass chick to ever hit the movie screen and she does not even mean to be bad ass either. The alien is one of the most unique creatures ever created.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Better than the original. Filled with more action than the first and somehow builds on an even better atmospheric story, and still has the same amazing effects as it's predecessor. Well James Cameron, I will accept you for some movies, and this shall be one of the movies."
1.0,1000617-aliens,best overall of the series.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"James Cameron is my favorite director, and possibly the best director of the 20th century. The detail he puts in this movie goes without saying."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Without argue, Aliens has made itself a big name compared to the original and brings you to a whole new scene of the same xenomorph monsters we always loved before!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"This is an outstanding movie. Moving, action packed and fast paced."
1.0,1000617-aliens,One of the best films I have ever seen. Loved every second of it.
1.0,1000617-aliens,It's some of the same formula from the last movie but comes off fresh with a new cast of more fleshed out characters (except ripely). Debatably this is a better sequel but it's unfair to compare the two because they are different genres but they are both fantastic movies.
1.0,1000617-aliens,The rise of Bill Paxton.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Excellent movie. For it's time it did exceptionally well with effect. Aliens used no CGI effect, it was all puppets and costumes - genius"
1.0,1000617-aliens,One of the best sequels ever made and a sci-fi horror action classic
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Thrilling roller coaster of a film that has a little bit of everything...sci-fi, horror action, gore...you name it, it's got it all tied up in a nice, tight package. Great acting, wild effects and great direction help make this the true classic it's become."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Once again,the even better sequel Aliens,gives us what made its original great ,and adding more with its colonial marines,strong performances,action packed,with its non-forgettable quote ""Its game over man,game over!"",and the weapons make this sequel worth the while to watch."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"A full blown science fiction classic. It was as great (albeit starkly different) as the first and far better than the rest in the series. The atmospheric tension, and surprisingly good acting made this film a roller coaster ride of thrills, kills, and big black aliens."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Faster paced than the first, but just as good. ""Aliens"" is once again a superb entry in the genre."
0.0,1000617-aliens,-: that fucking little girl...opposite of plot driven story telling. Everything seems so predictable and unnatural.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Game over man, Game over"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"while Alien was a masterpiece of a horror/ sci-fi film, Aliens was a masterpiece of an action/ sci-fi film. easily the best action movie ever made, with an original story that has been duplicated many times *cough* Halo *cough*"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"While ""Alien"" is a fantastic Sci-Fi Horror film, ""Aliens"" is a fantastic Sci-Fi Action film with horror elements. It's well directed, superbly acted, and more memorable than the original. Oh, and the Colonial Marines, really awesome!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"American classic enough said, but really what else is their to say about Aliens"
1.0,1000617-aliens,James Cameron not only reinvented the scifi horror of Alien but turned it into a heart stopping military action film with some of the most lovable soldiers ever put to film.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"A sharp contrast to the original (a roller coaster ride of action and violence, yet still intense and frightening, capped off with a legendary performance by Sigourney Weaver."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Heartbreaking, thrilling and exhilarating. There has never been a move classic thriller/horror movie. It's not at all hard to get sucked up into it's madness."
1.0,1000617-aliens,The bitch of all action films!!
1.0,1000617-aliens,"My favorite Alien film! One other Cameroon's classic. Action, thriller, horror and emotion Aliens all have it. One of the most successful sequel of the movie history..."

1.0,1000617-aliens,One of the few times a sequel is actually better then the original. 10/10
1.0,1000617-aliens,"The greatest sequel ever made! May not be a horror film like the first one, but Cameron created a suspenseful, thrilling, and action packed alien film. Expanded the universe to a whole new level!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Similar to its counterpart in themes and plot but much more intense and gripping, Aliens combines the best parts of the horror and sci-fi genres to create an awe-inspiring action masterpiece, as well as utilising the considerable talents of Sigourney Weaver and James Cameron."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Action,Suspence,Scares,Plot,Characters, and the badass xenomorph queen makes this movie a great watch."
1.0,1000617-aliens,Best action syfi ever

1.0,1000617-aliens,"The best Alien film ever made! The first was a horror film, this is the action roller coaster ride. It's the best film in the series, and far superior to that crap spin off film Prometheus."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Tense, intelligent and innovative. Aliens is as good as its predecessor"
1.0,1000617-aliens,Amazing! With great special effects and exceptional acting. This is a great improvement over an outstanding preceder
1.0,1000617-aliens,"The best sequel of all time, James Cameron does the impossible and takes the atmospheric and heart pounding ""alien"" and makes it a fast paced thrill ride sequel."
1.0,1000617-aliens,Classic of our generation
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Truthfully, one of the best movies I've seen and arguably one of the best movies of its decade, while the killer performance Sigoueney Weaver blew me out of my socks, the plot development with the suspense mixed in, makes me say 5 stars!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Possibly the best movie ever made, in my opinion. For a movie from the 80's, this one had it all: actors, crew, effects, plot, action. Everything."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"The zenith of sci-fi films. Weaver eclipses her role once again, as Cameron takes the reigns in a more intense action directing with memorable moments and relatable characters."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Even better than the first, ""Aliens"" is just as creepy, but more intense and filled with memorable scenes, lines and tons of action."
1.0,1000617-aliens,This is how you make a great sequel.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"While not only scary, it's well written, perfectly action packed, phenomenally acted especially by Sigourney Weaver, and like it's predecessor, creative in terms of set design. Aliens stands very tall within the sci-fi film pantheon."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"In my all time top 5. Michael Biehn's ""Hicks"" character is right at the top of my all time favorite characters as well as performances. The movie holds up so well almost thirty years after it's release. Genius cinema."
1.0,1000617-aliens,The tension was so thick you could cut it with a knife!
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Another example of James Cameron making a superior sequel, Aliens is without a doubt an improvement by adding explosive action and gritty performances."
1.0,1000617-aliens,My favorite movie in the Alien series. Space Marines with super weapons versus vast army of savage Aliens!
1.0,1000617-aliens,The best Alien-movie ever!
1.0,1000617-aliens,I own this on DVD and on Blu-Ray in a four movie pack along with:* Alien (1979)* Alien3 (1992)* Alien Resurrection (1997)
1.0,1000617-aliens,This might be better than the first movie! :)
1.0,1000617-aliens,This movie is a great action movie. Classic. Love it! James Cameron's best work.
1.0,1000617-aliens,5/5 * An extremly effective action horror thriller that surpasses the original in some respects presenting the main lead as a horror iconic hero with visceral and emotional fury.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Aliens is the classic example of a great si-fi movie. This film is one that every Sci-Fi, James Cameron, or Alien fanatic should check out."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"""Aliens"" is even more action-packed and alien-filled than the original."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Next best movie ever made... Game over man, Game over!!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"I actually had never seen this until last night. It was PHENOMENAL. Alien was good....a good solid horror movie. But this movie was just amazing. Ripley is a strong female leader, but she can be maternal as well. And the story....just....freaking....wonderful."
1.0,1000617-aliens,Classic. Badass female character taking on monsters. Intense and entertaining. Loved it.
1.0,1000617-aliens,Aliens throws intense action sequences into the mix and still retains much of the terror and horror from it's predecessor and both are surprisingly blended together magnificently. Aliens is a great sequel and an equally great movie.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"As James Rolfe (the AVGN) said, James Cameron can go to the grave knowing he made two of the best action sequels ever in cinema, one of which is ""Aliens."""
0.0,1000617-aliens,"Another shitty shitty movie. The action scenes are boring. There is no suspense. The ""military are bad"" theme is old and tired and not explored in any nuanced way here. The climax is hilariously awful. AJDSKFJDS"
1.0,1000617-aliens,Probably one of the best action movies ever made.
1.0,1000617-aliens,Best Sci-fi honor of all time.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"SIgourney. Ah, Sigourney. Sigourney, Sigourney, Sigourney."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"My second favorite movie EVER. Ripley is the Heroine every woman in movie/pop culture history (other then Princess Leia) wants to be. It's survival horror at it's grandest, it's just entertaining popcorn perfection."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Even better than the first, it's like the first was made just for this one. It's the action version of the first but also has just as many scares."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"A very different film than its predecessor, Aliens proves that taking a different road can sometimes be just what is fitting in a sequel"
1.0,1000617-aliens,Everything a sci-fi action movie should be.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"One of the greatest American films of the 1980's, ""Aliens"" captures and defines science fiction media."

1.0,1000617-aliens,Still one of the best if not THE best alien movie of all time.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"One of the most suspensful movies I've seen in my life; literally on the edge of my seat/yelling at the TV the entire movie. Great performance from Sigourny Weaver and easily the best in the series, took what was great about the first and improved on it!"

1.0,1000617-aliens,Possibly the greatest film ever made. Superb!
1.0,1000617-aliens,"There are two kinds of people in the world; people who prefer the movie Alien to Aliens and people who prefer the movie Aliens to Alien. And you can't go wrong with that. Just add a lot of cool action and suspense, with a plural to make an awesome sequel."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Awesome movie. Very tense, very suspenseful, very action-packed, with an excellent performance from Weaver."
1.0,1000617-aliens,One James Cameron's best films and the best film in the alien saga Aliens is one of many sequels that is better than the first and the big difference is that this film is action packed.
1.0,1000617-aliens,One of my all time favorite movies! A must see for any horror fan!
1.0,1000617-aliens,By far the best of the Alien movies. Sigourney Weaver comes back from the first film with a powerful persona while still having a maternal sense about her when it comes to dealing with her crew and the little girl.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Next to Terminator 2, this just might be the best sequel ever made!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"New direction, huge amount of aliens coming at the same time, makes this movie great entertainment movie.And James' direction, strong script, and Sigourney's acting, this movie also succeeded to be great drama."
1.0,1000617-aliens,Brilliant from start to finish. An all time favourite
1.0,1000617-aliens,In space no-one can hear you scream. In the movie theatre everyone will. I think this is the best in the series as seeing so many aliens then the queen is such a thrilling concept. Even better on blu-ray with the inclusion of MUTHUR mode.
1.0,1000617-aliens,All you need in a movie.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"In drastic contrast to the classic original, Aliens is classic in its own way. And by that I mean this is an action packed, extremely tense, and awesome film!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,One of the most suspenseful films I've seen in quite some time.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"a sequel that actually develops the ideas from the first movie and doesn't just try to copy it. Cameron has made a few good films, this remains his greatest."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"best action movie ever made, and awsome effects. and the directing is great. but the girl so annoying when she screams but I would be screaming to if there was a alien in front of me lol"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Whereas 'Alien' was one of the best horror films ever, 'Aliens' is one of the best action movies ever made. With a terrific lead heroine, a great cast of memorable characters, and some excellent effects/action sequences, this is easily one of the best sequels ever made."

1.0,1000617-aliens,"Aliens is the epitome of what a sci-fi/action blockbuster should look, sound and feel like."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"What happens when you make a sequel to a highly praised film by completely changing the director and genre? You get Aliens, a visually incredible film, with a faster pace, more focus on war and action and one of the most memorable finales in any film."

1.0,1000617-aliens,Better than the first (Alien).
1.0,1000617-aliens,"I think people don't understand how much this movie influenced media now watching it 23 years after it released.

1.0,1000617-aliens,"One of the best Sci-fi movies of all time! James Cameron as always turns the movies he directs into cinema gold. Everything and everyone that helped produce, star and create this movie deserves a full A+ rating. They dont make movies like this anymore!"

1.0,1000617-aliens,"Agree Agree Agree, This Movie Was Absolutly Badass"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"One of Cameron's best films, and a brilliant sequel to Alien, because it dared to do something different. i.e. Make a Vietnam film in space as opposed to the scary house style of the first. Ofcourse now it has been done to death, but Aliens stands the test of time."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Chilling and suspenseful, and doesn't rely too heavily on violence."
1.0,1000617-aliens,Great movie that keeps u at the edge of the seat.

1.0,1000617-aliens,"Where the 1st 1 was more of a horror come thriller this one is more action come thriller...I have to agree with a lot of the comments on here that its very rare to see a sequal that is as good as or dare I say it , better than the 1st..."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"One my favorite movies of all time. Great action, believable characters plus Bill Paxton is funny."
1.0,1000617-aliens,Pretty intense hardcore sci fi. Starts out pretty slow but gets rolling fast. Lives up to its reputation as a a superior sequel.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Aliens isn't exactly a suspensful horror film like Alien, but it is a darn good science fiction-action film. It does everything a sequel is supposed to do and does it well."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"If you want to make a good sequal, always have more guns. Guns and action. Guns and blood. More of what you feared in the first movie is what makes a great 2nd movie. More action, more people to get killed and a bigger area. This is what Aliens had and its what made it better than the first."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"With amazing action sequences, brilliant effects work, and a strong, multi-dimensional lead character, 'Aliens' is action filmmaking at its finest."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"this movie surpasses the original alien, although alien is darker and scarier, aliens is faster paced, and has more action, and aliens"

1.0,1000617-aliens,"One of the best sequel of all time! James Cameron went deeper into alien mythology and delivers not only a good horror movie, but also a pure action movie. And when you see the Alien Queen you know one thing - you will get away from her (bitch)!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,Ripley jumps from a monster horror flick to a balls-out action movie with such a fluid transition you barely notice it happened. Cameron is right at home and at the top of his game.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"I actually have an old starlog magazine where the director talks about what scenes had to be cut from the story in the first movie and viola! they all ended up here. More action than suspense or horror, but still enjoy this movie."

1.0,fantasia,Best Animated Feature of All Time.

1.0,fantasia,one of my favorites. this was all done before CGI
1.0,fantasia,"Stunning and beautiful animation matches the music perfectly.

1.0,fantasia,I personally loved this film. I don't think you will enjoy on bit of it if you don't like artwork or music. I loved how they associated the film/ artwork in the same rythym with the music being played. It really bridged the gap between art and music.
1.0,fantasia,Chernabog (Satan) is the most compelling character of the entire film.
1.0,fantasia,Great visuals and Music 5 out of 5
1.0,fantasia,"I really liked this movie, because it is just great and soothing to listen to like it will always but you in a good mood. Also the colors and pictures are very cool too! They use classical music for this movie, like Bach. The first song they play gets kind of aggressive then goes soft."
1.0,fantasia,"Fantasia may not have any dialogue, but I have a feeling that that is what makes it great. The animation is over its head for the 1940s, and the music that accompanies the sequences is charming. This one is still perfect in my book."

1.0,fantasia,"This is, by far, one of Disney's best films of all time."
1.0,fantasia,"It's been said that Fantasia isn't as good for kids as much as it is for adults and nerdy kids. It's defiantly an acquired taste but never the less Fantasia is beautifully made movie with a unique strategy of storytelling, and in my opinion it is the best Disney movie ever made."
1.0,fantasia,This is the closest thing I've seen Disney do that transcends animation into the realm of art. It's real food for the soul stuff. And all of its small failures seem only to add shading and depth to the over all exquisiteness of the film.
1.0,fantasia,The best animated musical ever.
1.0,fantasia,Best Film when I was a child. This is just amazing
1.0,fantasia,music with visual effects in perfect harmony
1.0,fantasia,"An original, inventive, imaginative and creative experience that, found in only a handful of films, allows audiences to create their own interpretations of the images on screen and turn them into meaning. Beautiful, colourful and brilliant, its one of the first exercises in excess movies released."
1.0,fantasia,"Disney's best. It surprises me why films like 2001 and Fantasia (films with little dialogue) aren't common. I know audience have come to except speech in film, but the music gets by so much more and is fantastic."
1.0,fantasia,Ok...we need it with a new full digital recording.We also need another Fantasia in full 3d

0.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,"A psychedelic waste pit of ugly UA animation, a song the only makes sense if you are on LSD, an bad acting."
1.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,"It's visuals may not be of the comprehension of some viewers (inluding me) but that can't remove the fact that Yellow Submarine is more than a musical, it's an authentic piece of art. Even many years after it's release, it has the same magic."
1.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,Endlessly inventive animation invigorates this tale of the Beatles saving a psychadelic fantasy land from a nasty horde of invaders. The images stagger the imagination and overall the film serves as the perfect complement to the Fab Four's late 60's material.
1.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,My favorite movie ever!

0.0,snowpiercer,"this movie was so spectacularly bad, I think that the ""fresh"" reviews on this site are some sort of social experiment..."
0.0,snowpiercer,Ugh. I could not get past the entire premise being a fantastically laughable plot hole. Could the writer have consulted a seven year-old with passing grades in science class before making this (spoiler alert) trainwreck?
0.0,snowpiercer,holy SHEET! what a senseless piece of shit
0.0,snowpiercer,"A blended coctail of Potential & Dissapointment, many of the movies moments are unrealistic & just when you think you're immersed in the story, you get yanked back out by some extremely cheesy moments."
0.0,snowpiercer,"Snowpiercer may have a great cast, but even that couldn't prevent it from being a big cliche and overacted trainwreck."
0.0,snowpiercer,Extremely poorly though-through movie

1.0,snowpiercer,"It's been a long time since I've seen a sci fi film this original. I won't say too much to avoid spoilers, but expect to be appalled at the class divide and the way the human race lives on in this apocalyptic future."
0.0,snowpiercer,"Probably the worst movie I've seen in awhile. It starts off great and even continues to be engaging. However, the ending completely ruined the entire movie. The entire film kept building you up and then nothing happens and the movie ends! Complete let down!"
1.0,snowpiercer,"It's a movie meant to be dark and gloomy because the train they stay in is basically a condensed version of the world we live in, a world ruled by greedy men and women but sustained by the poor and lower classes of society. It's a movie so real that it becomes quite scary."
1.0,snowpiercer,An great movie from 2014.
1.0,snowpiercer,"I've never seen anything like this film, and Tilda Swinton is amazing."
0.0,snowpiercer,This was the worst movie I have ever watched start-to-finish; I am shocked it has a 95% critic rating. The writing was atrocious and the acting was pretty darn bad as well. Definitely do not recommend wasting two hours watching this.

0.0,snowpiercer,I started to watch this on Netflix and couldn't get past the first 20 minutes. Should it have ever made it to the theater?
1.0,snowpiercer,Awesome movie and I hope they make snowpiercer 2 soon!
0.0,snowpiercer,Why are the ratings so high from RT and viewers for this movie? Makes me question their sanity.

1.0,snowpiercer,This is an interesting take on a new ice age it is unlike anything I've seen in cinema to date. It's definitely worth a watch.
1.0,snowpiercer,This movie is bugged out. I like it.
0.0,snowpiercer,This was the worst movie that I have ever seen. I don't understand the critics ratings. The storyline was pathetic and I couldn't imagine how the critics could love it so much. So I watched in horror at how bad it was on so many levels.
1.0,snowpiercer,Can't believe it's free on netflix. This movie is amazing. It goes way beyond any distopian future movie that has already came out. The acting in this movie really hits home and makes you feel for each character. If you have Netflix watch this as soon as possible it is worth the time.
0.0,snowpiercer,A painfully boring movie that was gratuitously and unnecessarily violent. Probably the worst science fiction I have seen in years. Simply cannot understand why it has so many good reviews as usually the Tomatometer has never let me down.
0.0,snowpiercer,"95% Tomatometer, WTF, this movie was terrible from start to finish. Just another movie produced and directed by liberal ideology."
1.0,snowpiercer,The part at the end (you know which part I'm talking about) is probably the best piece of acting I've ever seen.

1.0,snowpiercer,One of the most innovative movies I've seen in a long time.
1.0,snowpiercer,"This film starts with confusion and a destructive, appocolyptical world view. A train coursing through a destroyed earth-and all the earth inhabitants ""trapped"" on said train. What a fantastical and fresh take on the theme. Watch this. Words can't explain."

0.0,snowpiercer,One of the worst scripts ever.
0.0,snowpiercer,"Weird, barbaric, this movie hallucinates itself as profound but when it sobers up in the light of the morning, sees itself struck dumb by how foolish it really is. I don't recommend this movie at all. It is way overrated."
0.0,snowpiercer,Crap! Absolute crap. I am baffled by the grand reviews.
1.0,snowpiercer,A nonstop action thrill ride! I couldn't look away even once. The story is incredible. I honestly couldn't figure out what was going to happen next! Couldn't find a thing wrong with this film.So good! You've just got to see it! 10/10

0.0,snowpiercer,"Very disappointing given the Rotten Tomato rating, very poor movie"
0.0,snowpiercer,"This is fucked. Are you kidding me? If I wanted to watch Drive, stuck on a train in slow motion, I'd watch this movie. Just because Tilda Swinton (creepy) is in this, doesn't mean it's a good idea. So she screams drop your weapon and everyone does? Rotten Tomatoes is shit. and this is proof."

1.0,iron_giant,"Bird's Iron Giant, infused with both nostalgia and paranoia of the 1950s is a modern classic. Weaves themes of escalating war and battling xenophobia with a child's imagination. Like the movie's metal man himself it defies expectations and soars to great heights."

1.0,young_frankenstein,"This is my favorite Mel Brooks film. It ages very well and the gags still work perfectly. Gene Wilder and Marty Feldman are hilarious. Peter Boyle plays the very memorable monster. Brooks has many of his regular staples, but they all work perfectly."
1.0,young_frankenstein,"Spoofs express their best when the internal mechanic is the same from their source material: if it's intimate, it works. Because it has the biggest Schwanzst√ºck."

1.0,marwencol,"There are some things you don't get over, but it's amazing how we can make something so terrible into something so magically artistic. This is an amazingly strange documentary that gives new meaning to what people call ""meta."""
1.0,marwencol,"Deeply touching is the story of Mark Hogancamp, the victim of an utterly despicable tragedy and now a unique artist. This movie strongly affected me. Everyone should see it."
1.0,marwencol,"hi dear friend, should really see this!"
1.0,marwencol,Just saw this today. Beautiful and inspiring movie.
1.0,marwencol,"Many people exploit awful experiences, but this film seemed very genuine. It seemed as if Hogancamp inspired this movie, and didn't request it to be made. It was both sad and funny. I suggest seeing it if it is available to you."
1.0,marwencol,Excelente e inspirador documentario
1.0,marwencol,Pure and utter genius.
1.0,marwencol,"Not only was this movie beautifully made, it was compassionate and present to Mark Hogancamp's experience all the way to the end. No spoiler alert in the trailer either, which is refreshing. This movie is Oscar bound imho."

1.0,nosferatu,This is one the scariest movie ever. IT has great acing. it also a great story line.
1.0,nosferatu,Classic Absolute without more.
1.0,nosferatu,Best 1st of the classic monsters even Coppola can't remake but he did a good job the original is far more creepy
1.0,nosferatu,"Horror movies ground zero, I know Caligari came first, but nothing beats an old horror character. One of the best silent movies I have ever seen, the film have an erie mood with a painting kind of impression, making the horror experience even better."
1.0,nosferatu,Great Movie. One of the best.
1.0,nosferatu,"A classic movie introducing many filming techniques used in horror to this day. This movie also has a swapped gender role story line, which is very far ahead of its time. All together, it is an important movie in its themes and its cinematography."
1.0,nosferatu,"A true gothic story, Nosferatu is full of eeriness and has a chilling performance from Max Shreck"
1.0,nosferatu,"10 out of 10:Nosferatu may be a silent film, but it still manages to be creepy with its great set design and makeup and a nice feel."
1.0,nosferatu,"i'm pretty sure the simply fact that a 16 year old boy in 2016 genuinely enjoys this film, i DEFINITELY a good sign"
1.0,nosferatu,"One of the best films of all time, it was a master piece shot in the style of German Expressionism. It utilised several techniques such as stop motion and foreshadowing. The story itself was a loose adaptation of Dracula though the creepy effect is still haunting even till today."
1.0,nosferatu,"It is incontestably a historical piece of cinema, the birth of the vampire in popular culture as well as a great example of the German Expressionist moviment. A classic of the classics. 5/5 stars"
1.0,nosferatu,"This timeless horror classic is scary, but enjoyable to watch and is better than lots of horror films today. I could watch this a thousand times and it would still be creepy. This masterpiece has great music, great actors, and it lives up to its eeriness to this day."
1.0,nosferatu,Went to see it with my boyfriend and they had a live band playing for the sound. It was amazing!
0.0,nosferatu,although I highly respect it as it's probably the first ever horror movie and it was extremely groundbreaking I personally found it quite boring and not enjoyable
1.0,nosferatu,"Nosferatu is a classic Horror-film, with iconic scenes and one of the best Horror-movie antagonists. Nosferatu is a great film with a good tragic ending, and deserves five stars."
1.0,nosferatu,"Classic horror, the first vampire film."
1.0,nosferatu,"One of the finest of the silent era, Nosferatu remains an influence to the horror genre thanks to its gritty feel and creepy performance by Max Schreck that still delivers some chills even after many years!!!"
1.0,nosferatu,"I used to be scared by his face as a kid. I grew out of that and now I realize that its a great movie and its legitimately creepy, especially for the time"
1.0,nosferatu,beats the hell out of alot of movies nowadays
1.0,nosferatu,Shrek's terrifying disposition as Nosferatu adds a whole new layer of horror. Murnau is in top form as always. The visuals and tight structure are to be revered and are frequently mimicked in modern horror with good reason.
1.0,nosferatu,Stephanie Meyer needs to watch this!!
1.0,nosferatu,"Amazingly eerie and frighteningly alive despite the limitations of this silent era of filming. I am a lover of all things horror, and this movie fit the bill very well. The creepiness of Nosferatu still works even in 2014, where there is a high standard for horror."
1.0,nosferatu,"90+ years old and still the best version of *coughs* Dracula to date - startling use of shadows and negative photography, and Max Shrek is still bloody terrifying!"
1.0,nosferatu,very cool to see something that old.
1.0,nosferatu,"Wonderfully acted and hauntingly shot, Murnau's horror epic still retains its power nearly 100 years (!) after it was made. Hilariously, considering the circumstances under which it was made, it also might be the best film adaption of ""Dracula"" to date."
1.0,nosferatu,"It's a classic, what's not to love."
1.0,nosferatu,"Schreck plays the eponymous vampire with an almost savage simplicity, and teamed with Murnau's striking and frightful visual storytelling created some of cinema's most lasting and haunting imagery. While not out and out terrifying, Nosferatu is eerily spooky and chilling."
1.0,nosferatu,One of the greatest horror films of all time.
1.0,nosferatu,I Loved It! I've always Wanted to see it and I Personally Love Max Shreck's Creepy Performance! Its Hard To Believe that He was one of those Actors that couldn't get out of character! Fantastic!

1.0,nosferatu,Never thought a silent film could be scary...this is.
1.0,nosferatu,"Excellent, still scary after 91 years. Well worth watching to see where most later films in the genre got their ideas. Although clich√©d now, this was the original and once you set the modern horror clich√© aside, one can see the greatness in this film."
1.0,nosferatu,"A great silent classic, who put some extras to the legend of Dracula and vampires. Must see!"
1.0,nosferatu,"Creepy, beautiful and groundbreaking."
1.0,nosferatu,A true classic of the silent era
1.0,nosferatu,"It's the one that started it all. Five stars in the bank. Of course, I have to admit that this was just a bit more enjoyable watching in the context of John Malcovich's and Willem Dafoe's wonderful interpretation, ""Shadow of the Vampire""."
1.0,nosferatu,95% The makeup for Nosferatu is astounding for a film this old.
1.0,nosferatu,Bram Stoker's Dracula in a German silent film with Hans Erdmann doing the score is the ideal combination for instant horror success. Vampire culture meets the big screen for the first time in this historic gem. Look for this online as it will be hard to find.
1.0,nosferatu,"I think it's incredible how this film can truly scare without the use of any sound. The German Expressionist sets are great as well. The iconic use of shadow is great. This was the first silent film I ever saw, and it was an excellent experience."
0.0,nosferatu,"Nosferatu was creepy, but oh my god was it a boring movie. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was scary for it's time, but my was it boring."

1.0,nosferatu,"Scary and masterful, Nosferatu is probably the most influential Horror film ever made. This is the real first adaption of Bram Stroker's Dracula and is the best adaption too. Max Shrek makes a frightening performance as Count Orlock. Nosferatu is the best Horror film ever made."

1.0,nosferatu,"If you're into horror, or silent films; this is a must see! Excellent FX too."

1.0,nosferatu,No vampire film before or since has been either as disturbing or as artful.
1.0,nosferatu,"Nosferatu is both a cinematic treat and a cinematic threat. Dark and grim in all the right places, poetic and creepy. Schreck as Orlock is like the physical manifestation of death itself."
1.0,nosferatu,The imagery still hunts me at night!
1.0,nosferatu,One of the best films in movie history. Very creepy. A classic!
1.0,nosferatu,Creepy vampire movie...I think it's because it is a silent movie.

1.0,nosferatu,Still the most legitimately frightening movie vampire.
1.0,nosferatu,"Easily one of the most memorable horror films from the silent era, Nosferatu is one of the greatest adaptions of Bram Stoker's Dracula - even if it wasn't technically legally adapted - especially thanks to Schreck's unforgettably frightening performance as the vampire himself."
1.0,nosferatu,"The classic 1922 vampire that created a memorial film genre is amazing with the directorial work of F.W. Murnau, and Max Schreck's performance as Count Orlok."
1.0,nosferatu,"Perhaps the most iconic film in classical horror, Nosferatu sends audiences to all kinds of different dimensions of filmmaking techniques with this imaginative vampire story."

1.0,nosferatu,"One of the scariest movies I have seen in black and white. I liteally got scared. I was surprised by how scared I got during a silent movie, now that's bad ass. It's a good movie.

1.0,iron_man,The one that started it all. Iron Man set the tone for what is now a juggernaut in Hollywood. RDJ throughout the series has the best character arc and we see how it all began right here. 5 Stars.
1.0,iron_man,"Iron man is an amazing, fun, visually stunning and superbly acted movie that leaves films like the infamous Howard the duck and captain America (1990) in the dust."
1.0,iron_man,Amazing! Iron Man is awesome! I highly recommend it!
1.0,iron_man,"the best way you could have started off the marvel cinematic universe, to make it better maybe have included antman in a later film to get the real and true aspect of how the avengers was put together."

1.0,iron_man,"Re-watching the MCU movies, and I think this first one might end up being one of the best! I had forgotten some of Iron Man's rad origin story, but not how insanely charming Robert Downy Jr. is Tony Stark - smart, sexy & funny. The CG is still impressive a decade later too."

1.0,iron_man,Where it all began. Terrance Howard was pretty dumb to bail on the MCU over money. But in the end I like Cheadle better so it all worked out. Marvel knocked it out of the park with this one. I just wish we could have more Iron Man movies.

1.0,iron_man,"Way, way more awesome than I expected. One of, if not the, best superhero movie to date. I'm really looking forward to the second."
1.0,iron_man,"Such a fantastic movie. For a hero that is not as popular like Spider-Man, Hulk, The X-Men, Wolverine this turned out great. Among one of the best comicbook movies. I am sure part 2 will be on top to."
1.0,iron_man,Not since Christopher Reeve has some one played a comic book superhero as flawlessly as Robert Downey Jr plays Iron man.
1.0,iron_man,Just... so fucking cool.
1.0,iron_man,"Great movie. Very cool, pretty funny, and led by an awesome performance from Downey Jr."

1.0,iron_man,"Robert Downey Jr. Is an example of an actor who has beaten his demons, and rebuilt himself as a A-List actor, and it all began with this film. He is terrific playing Tony Stark, the wealthy, somewhat narcissIstic playboy who eventually becomes the titular Iron Man."
1.0,iron_man,Part 2 and 3 can't even compare to this original. Producers made Iron Man a laughing stock. Balance it out and make it serious as well.
1.0,iron_man,Probably the best Marvel movie there will ever be.
1.0,iron_man,"this is actually my favorite comic book movie. it makes you feel like you to could make an iron man suit. plus it makes you really want to have one. honestly, this is the only movie in the iron man trilogy worth watching more than once."
1.0,iron_man,This movie was great!
1.0,iron_man,it is a very exciting action marvel movie
1.0,iron_man,"A good movie doesn't just make for a good moment, but inspires you to greatness. Worst part of this movie is that it's taking a page from my childhood daydreams. They even got the cliffside house right! Well, now you know."
1.0,iron_man,"Totally enjoyable, fun, high-octane summer blockbuster. Possibly the best super-hero movie I've ever seen. Downey, Jr. is superb and I have to admit, I like Gwyneth with a little meat on her bones. Highly recommended."

1.0,iron_man,"absolutely fantastic, left me on the edge of my seat"
1.0,iron_man,One of the best comic book movies...
1.0,iron_man,Iron Man is the best Marvel has to offer and is a great origin story for the character of Iron Man.

1.0,iron_man,good movie like the storyline
1.0,iron_man,"If you're going to set out to create a cinematic universe, then you could do worse than have this be your first foray. By turns jaw-droppingly awesome and laugh out loud funny, this is practically pitch perfect throughout."
1.0,iron_man,A brilliant exciting film! Wow!
1.0,iron_man,iron man is awesomeness
1.0,iron_man,"Absolutely in love with RDJ in this role. I don't think I could ever get sick of watching him as Tony Stark. I'm also very fond of Terrence Howard's as Rhodey, and as much as I love Don Cheadle, this version of Rhodey remains my favorite."
1.0,iron_man,"Hillaurious, action packed and with a in depth story that will be expanded in more than just sequels this an exciting start to what can be an excellent franchise."

1.0,wings_of_desire,"A meditative work on what is human from the angel of angels. The Colombo actor adds a bit of vividness, but it is the Marion who captivates my attention."
1.0,wings_of_desire,A creative movie looking at German Berlin in the 80s without using the word Communism once. What better way to look at history than the eyes of timeless Angels.
1.0,wings_of_desire,"A black & white recommendation: if you are open to art and poetry in cinema, it is a must. If you just like Hollywood, miss it."
1.0,wings_of_desire,I give this a 100/A+.

1.0,wings_of_desire,"""Dedicated to all the former angels"""
1.0,wings_of_desire,"I think I fell in love with this movie first because I desire that it be true, and that the angels in which I do not believe believe in me, and second because it shares an aesthetic I had not yet uncovered in myself. I have often watched the first half alone, in search of solace of an unknown kind."
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Una gran lecci√É¬≥n de creatividad, profundidad , claridad y osad√É¬≠a f√É¬≠lmica. Incre√É¬≠ble la manera de conjugarlo todo sin raspar los l√É¬≠mites de la conciencia."
1.0,wings_of_desire,a great exemple of poetry in movies!
1.0,wings_of_desire,This film is poetry in motion. Breathtaking cinematography and a deeply moving meditation on humanity and the connections we make with each other.
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Probably the best film ever made. Also a record of a city and it's people and culture, West Berlin, that now only exists in the memory of those of us that were there at that time and in this film."
1.0,wings_of_desire,another good movie by Wim Wenders
1.0,wings_of_desire,A beautiful and complex masterpiece. A poetic film that I haven't completely understood yet but I am really looking forward to re-watching it. A worthwhile experience. So meticulously detailed and brilliant use of cinematography.
1.0,wings_of_desire,Wim Wender's offers his audience something of a lesson in Berlin's pyscho-geography alongside perhaps the most haunting protrayl of angels in film.
1.0,wings_of_desire,A stunningly simple yet beautiful film.

1.0,wings_of_desire,"Again, Wim Wenders. Great."
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Wim Wenders has such a unique style. He had the visuals down in Paris, Texas, but he really nail everything with this. Very poetic. Whenever I find myself describing this film to someone, I almost want to cry."
1.0,wings_of_desire,good movie and very physiological but few years later Hollywood had to made a remake with Nicolas cage and meg Ryan
1.0,wings_of_desire,Needless to say it haunts more and more at every new viewing.
1.0,wings_of_desire,great mix of using color and black and white so many awesome moments in this
1.0,wings_of_desire,Full of poetic beauty and sensitivity. A meditative journey for the soul
1.0,wings_of_desire,It's poetry in motion...pictures that is. If only more films were like this film. Amazing!
1.0,wings_of_desire,One of the most beautiful German movies I have ever seen!
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Wim Wenders finds means to say something that could not have been siad otherwise. It's a film about material, immaterial and the relationship in between."
1.0,wings_of_desire,I'd give up forever to touch you.
1.0,wings_of_desire,"The sequence with the author & thinker walking through Berlin, thinking about the damaged city along with the love vested in the color portion with the trapeze dancer are two points of extremely distinct grace that are surprising to find in one film."
1.0,wings_of_desire,Best movie EVER. Fact.

1.0,wings_of_desire,A truly amazing piece of cinema.
1.0,wings_of_desire,Fantastisk! Betongpornografi.
0.0,wings_of_desire,"This is the dumbest movie I've ever seen. I turned it off after 20 minutes of ""dummes, belangloses Zeug"". I'm not interested in hearing people's inner thoughts or to angels speak calmly about ""becoming humans""."
1.0,wings_of_desire,possibly my favorite all time film
1.0,wings_of_desire,watched this yet again last night because i just recently got it on criterion collection blu-ray. among the greatest ever.
1.0,wings_of_desire,"In many ways, the finest film of the 80's...perhaps ever."
1.0,wings_of_desire,i love this movie it so good
0.0,wings_of_desire,"Apparently, this is a classic. I actually fell asleep whilst watching it and woke up to find - to my disappointment- that it was still on. A shame, as Wender's 'Paris Texas' is one of my favourite films."
1.0,wings_of_desire,A very moving elegy about the yearnings of all of the inhabitants in a divided world. It's also one of the most truly romantic films I seen in how an angel is willing to give up his wings and immortality to be with the woman he loves. A film that truly stays with you.
1.0,wings_of_desire,The true value of the gift of humanity is both a sadness and a joy. (Wim Wenders is quickly becoming one of my new favorite filmmakers.)
1.0,wings_of_desire,Its film or poetry? I never felt this feeling before.........thank you Wenders
1.0,wings_of_desire,"It's not a film for everyone. Too artsy for some and too slow for others, but if you give it a chance, you're in for one of the finest films from any country, in any language. I didn't get into it at first, but once I started to understand this world of angels, it really started to grab me."
1.0,wings_of_desire,its an out of the world movie!! an outstanding experience!!
1.0,wings_of_desire,My all-time favorite film.
1.0,wings_of_desire,i say only one thing: scene in library!
1.0,wings_of_desire,A grand reunification tale.
1.0,wings_of_desire,Very few scenes ever captivated me more than watching the late Solveig Dommartin swinging herself with such enchantment in the trapeze while being watched by an angel in black and white.
1.0,wings_of_desire,Not so much a movie as it is a visual experience. It takes a director with real talent to create real emotions without having to use dialogue. Wim Wenders is that talent.
1.0,wings_of_desire,"beautiful film with a beautiful story, beautiful cinematography, beautiful words, beautiful style, and beautiful scenes.,Why am I me and why not you? Why am I here watching this movie and why not there doing something else? sure god couldn't have been more nicer to me.."
1.0,wings_of_desire,"a beautiful, mesmerising, haunting, lovely, poetic film that captivates you from the start. Bruno Ganz is perfect as the Angel who falls in love with a mortal.  Peter Falk adds an extra dimension - a great addition to the film."
1.0,wings_of_desire,Just saw this on the big screen for the first time. Love it.
1.0,wings_of_desire,This film is indescribable. Just reading the director's original pitch barely does the film justice. It has to be experienced.
1.0,wings_of_desire,"One of my all-time favorites. It's definitely the sort film that has to be watched without distraction and if you are looking to be spoon-fed a storyline, I'd keep looking. It's the sort of film that drifts, leaving it up to you to follow along."
0.0,wings_of_desire,The German version of City of Angels. I skipped and forwarded my way through it. Some poignant moments and I do understand what they were trying to do. I like the fact that it makes you feel for the struggles of mankind without the sappy ending.
1.0,wings_of_desire,Second best movie of all history
1.0,wings_of_desire,If I ever see this again I'm sure I will like it even more. The arthouse style is not that familiar to me so it took some time to get used to the pacing and style. The only thing that bothered me was Marion's monologue in the end. Seemed misplaced a bit.
1.0,wings_of_desire,the closest i've seen film come to poetry
1.0,wings_of_desire,"""Las alas del deseo"" Una hermos√≠sima pel√≠cula de Win Wenders; la primera parte de ""Tan cerca, tan lejos""."

1.0,wings_of_desire,Skip the American version and go straight to this Wim Wenders classic. Great cameo by Peter Falk and a nice twist to go along with him.
1.0,wings_of_desire,a sweet analysis of human complexity
1.0,wings_of_desire,"It's one of those films that is both artsy AND really cool. It even has a Nick Cave cameo. It was remade into City of Angels, only with all the cool stuff removed."
1.0,wings_of_desire,Beautiful. Achingly beautiful. All elements of this movie come together and present a wonderful celebration of life and all the little simple great things about it.
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Formidable, magnifico, an fear and any other words that come to mind in any country."
1.0,wings_of_desire,A haunting and atmospheric masterpiece. This film gets you into the head of an angel. It really makes you rethink all of the glorious little details of life. I loved it.
1.0,wings_of_desire,noch einmal: so sch√É¬∂n!
1.0,wings_of_desire,I cringed when this got remade with Nicolas Cage in it. One of my all time favorites.

1.0,wings_of_desire,The rancid gash from Meg Ryan and Niicholas Cage in the re-make was an insult...
1.0,wings_of_desire,Beautifully written and directed. Amazing photography. It send you to another sphere of thoughts.

1.0,wings_of_desire,Beautiful. Moving. Unique. Impressive.
1.0,wings_of_desire,"And elegiac masterpiece about as simple and complex a subject as what it means to exist in time, or, essentially, what is to be human. A film so rich that one viewing could never do it justice. Brilliant."
1.0,wings_of_desire,One of the great poetic experiences in the history of the cinema!
1.0,wings_of_desire,"sorti en France sous le nom : ""Les Ailes du D√É¬©sir"" ! Par le meilleur film avec le lieutenant Columbo ! (pourrait s'intituler ""Columbo et le mur de Berlin"")"

1.0,wings_of_desire,"es impresionante la mirada de Wenders acerca de la humanidad, de la vida en s√É¬≠ misma .... su cine es muestra de un cari√É¬±o por los peque√É¬±os detalles y las grandes casualidades. Lo dice todo con ""Ich weiss jetst, was kein Engel weiss""... una oda a la vida"

1.0,wings_of_desire,A beautiful film. The constant camera movements capture a sureal and unearthly character which was perfect for the film. Nothing about the black and white to colour and back feels trite. Everything about it works in every way. Could have easily been boring but instead is pure genius.
1.0,wings_of_desire,"Es ist nicht die Romantik des Films Ich liebe die meistenEs ist die Art, wie sie k√É¬∂nnen eine Verbindung mit Menschen und wie sie erreichtMenschen Gedanken"

1.0,wings_of_desire,"Yep. Still love it. Still love Peter Falk, still love Wim Wenders, still love it. Even the long talkey scenes. And the DVD has the deleted pie fight scene, which even cracks Wenders up. That's worth the price of admission alone."

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Its incredible how well James Whale's horror classic has aged. The greatest Frankenstein movie made is technically astonishing even to this day and Boris Karloff is both frightening and emotionally touching as Frankenstein's monster. Perhaps the greatest universal horror movies ever made.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,The best horror film ever made! Astonishing performances by Karloff and Clive! The reviving of the bride is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror films.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"This is a great sequel! I love that it, to me, has some comedic lines. Or maybe its just my brain because I LOVE Young Frankenstein? :)))"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,This movie does the impossible multiple times. It makes the monster into an endearing character. The movie makes you feel for the murdering mix of dead bodies. And most of all: it expands and exceeds the original. One of Universal's best!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,This was strangely magical and creepy with a heart hidden within itself.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"awsome, just awsomne!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"A true classic. Even better than the original. Ernst Thesiger practically steals the show with his flamboyant and macabre Dr. Pretorius. A must see, if not own, for any true horror fan."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Perfect! She's alive,she's alive...."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Alone, bad... Friend, good..."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the best Frankenstein movies ever.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"A Fantastic film. The Monster is more present in this film and is very enjoyable to watch. Boris will always be the best Frankenstein as far as I'm concerned. Elsa Lanchester is very Haunting and beautiful as the bride, yet her hissing is very eerie. If you love Horror movies this is a must see."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"I actually really liked it. The special effects were extremely impressive for 1936, Boris Karloff did an amazing job as The Monster, supporting actors and other roles were great actors,and the scene with the blind man for some reason really touched me. The whole friend idea I guess. I reccommend."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Really is one of the greatest movies of all time. Deserves to be among the ranks of Citizen Kane or Sunset Boulevard.

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"""The Monster Demands a Mate"" Exceptional! Bravo! , Greatest of all Frankenstein film. It's rare for a film to have a sequel which is way better than the original one or had the same level of appreciation!. One of my favorites of all time!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One Of The Worlds Greatest Horror/Thriller Movies!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"fantastic film - possibly better than original, shows more brutality than the original and more character development. A superb masterpiece of early cinema"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Another one of those rare sequels that outshine their predecessors. Also directed by James Whale 'The Bride of Frankenstein' manages to delve deeper into the characters from the original film. Again Karloff gives his all as the Creature who longs for acceptance.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"About as brilliant as a sequel can get. Great story, interesting characters, beautiful music, and the performances by the actors are amazing. Bride of Frankenstein is a true cinematic Masterpiece."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"This is definately my favorite of the sereis. Clive and Karloff bothe give great preformances and makes you feel for the characters, even the monster. dr. Pretoreous is one of the best villains on screen and possibley the best mad doctor portrayed in a motion picture. check it out cause its epic."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"The best of the Universal monster movies. Bride is that rare sequel that, after viewing, feels like an essential companion to the original, the other half to complete the story. It's also truer to the book (a little), and just incredibly satisfying all around."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"The Bride of Frankenstein is just as great as the original, but this time around, we feel for the monster."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Personal favorite. I love this movie. ""To a new world of gods and monsters!"""
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"No doubt about this...one of the greatest masterpieces ever seen. If you haven't seen it yet, do whatever it takes to get a copy !!!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,I love this film so much!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Clive and Karloff continue to own their respective roles. This time Elsa Lanchester is along for the ride and adds something special. I'd actually argue that this is superior to the original Frankenstein.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"As classic as Whale's Frankenstien is, his sequel is even better. A true masterpiece and one of the crown jewels in the Universal classic monster series!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"just like its predecessor, classic"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"I√¢(TM)d have to say all of the Universal Frankensteins held to a marvelously entertaining standard. Yes. Even √¢Frankenstein Meets Wolfman.√¢?  The humor James Whale injected into this one was quite a risk, but it came of beautifully, only increasing our sympathies for The Monster."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Yes. This is how you make a movie. Fantastic characters all around and insanely good lines.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Despite the fact that people will inevitably compare and contrast this with the original 1931 Frankstein, this is a different, pardon the pun, beast. Bride of Frankenstein is characterised by the camp and hammy performances of Ernst Thesiger and Una O'Connor and a sly, dark sense of humour."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Absolutely the best Frankenstein movie ever.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the very few sequels which improves on the first film. This is a blackly comic horror.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"This was the last of the great Universal horror films...after this, Universal took a downward trend into cheap camp, and the bright spots for the next 20 years were few and far in-between."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"More emotionally powerful than it has any right to be, ""Bride"" forever destroys the idea that a sequel is always inferior. Great emotion, iconic imagery, and even visual effects, are what make this widely considered one of the greatest thrillers ever put to film."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Director James Whale once again creates another great Frankenstein movie. As a sequel, the movie sticks a little more truthfully to the book and manages to give the monster a voice. A strange and at times funny film."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the best horror films ever made. A classic of the 1930s.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,30 Days of Horror Day 22:A sad horror movie.More on this come October 31st.

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"One of the best horror movies ever, where you can actually see character development and wher flaws are minimum"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,The rare sequel that outdoes the first film.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Lanchester was awesome and this movie was just great as well. This one was actually better than the first one which is saying something
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"It takes everything that works in the first Frankenstein and improves it. The shots are more iconic, the score is outstanding, the Monster learns to speak and the film mixes creepiness, pathos and still-impressive special effects into one incredible film. A visual masterpiece, regardless of genre."
0.0,bride_of_frankenstein,While i do love the old monster movies this is just not a good one. It was way too stupid. 16%
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"An absolute classic of a horror film. Karloff is fantastic, as are Dwight Frye and Ernest Thesiger. A shame The Bride isn't in it that much. Who knows what it would've been like then?"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,a highly entertaining film. a sequel which is better than the original. it had a bigger budget and it is obvious. sets are huge. there are more storylines. everything is much more complex. it is even funny at times. plus its tense and exciting. and beautifully filmed. classic.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Great sequel! It has all the elements that made Tim Burton, Tim Burton! Emo kids, Jack fans, all that gothic art direction, that surreal world and those dark and twisty were here first! Brilliant!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"I was no older than 10 when I saw this, and I had such a crush on Elsa Lanchester (I know, you don't have to say it)."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"maybe better than the first one, eh?"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Elevates the monster movie mythos to a whole other level. Unbelievable.

0.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Another oldie crapfest.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Atmospheric, campy and just plain fun to watch. I love the whole 7 film Frankenstein series released by Universal in the 30's and 40's but this one is my favortite. This, the second in the series, was the last one directed by James Whale."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Some say this is better than the first one, it's definitely a close one. More science fiction is thrown in with the black magic dr. and his miniature people, it's kinda weird but that's the only part I have a problem with, everything else is great!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"One of the great horror films, is also a biting satire of love and acceptance. Lonely guy wants to meet a nice girl, he gets two doctors to create her and she rejects him. But that's how it goes in life. The ugly guy will always be rejected by the girl for the good looking doctor."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"The best Frankenstein movie and one of the true Hollywood classics! It's also the rare sequel that is as good as, if not better than, the original!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Vast improvement over the predecessor. Tight script, unexpected characters and highly memorable scenes."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,the bride of frankenstein is my only weakness
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"The greatest sequal ever made. Far surpassing the original in it's scope, story, and ending. I love every frame of this film. A desire to have someone else so bad that you will do anything to get her, and realizing that it was not meant to be."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,fantastic movie about judging not on appearences and finding friends
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,all time horror classic
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Now this is a horror movie. Classic in every sense.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"One of my all-time favorite films, horror or otherwise.

Every actor is perfectly cast, and every production detail from special effects to music are spot-on."

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"The 1st was great, but this one maybe even ten times better."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,A classic. To this day Boris Karloff is still the original Frankenstein.

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,My favorite horror movie ever made. possibly my favorite movie of all time.It is one of the most beautiful movies ever made. the set design and musical score are amazing and the cast is first rate.

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Excellent sequel that's on par and even better than the first.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Better than FRANKENSTEIN on every level, Whale and Karloff seem to have grown into their roles with this franchise. Has yet to be surpassed (Fuck that DeNiro piece of crap)"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"I guess you could say this film is the Godfather Pt. 2 of horror. Its one of the very few horror sequels that manages to be better than the original. Don't get me wrong James Whale's Frankenstein is an absolute classic, but this one is better."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Oh please, if this isn't one of the greatest horror movies ever!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"One of those rare sequels that surpasses the original in every possible way. Karloff is brilliant as the sympathetic monster, the special effects are fantastic, and James Whale's stylistic direction is years ahead of its time! Loved it!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Otra prueba de que las segundas partes pueden superar al original. Mas diversion, mas subtexto, mas momentos inolvidables. Esta es la pelicula definitiva de la serie de Frankenstein."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Dr. Pretorius is so much scarier than Karloff in this. We feel so much more sympathy for the monster in this one and there are some very clever special effects. The best Frankenstein film I've seen.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,This is a good movie
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"One of the first extremely subversive horror films. A true Masterpiece. James Whale is a genius, he made one of maybe two films that showcased the brilliance of Mary Shelly's book."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Not just a great horror movie, this is great film, period. Weird and delightful."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Easily the best of the classic monster movies! This film took everything that worked in the first and built onto it a really moving and at times tear-jerking cinematic experience. This film is amoungst my top 10 favorite films of all time!

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Boris Karloff does it again with his great performance in this classic.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Quite possibly the best sequal ever made. Despite her short screen time Elsa Lanchesters bride is one of the most iconic Universal monsters, and my personal favourite."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,A masterpiece that is absolutely timeless and needs no further introduction or words.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"De toda una saga, de toda una epoca, la joya maxima de los estudios Universal."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"to the untrained eye this film simply reaffirms social norms and values, but it is subtly coded with subversive critiques of race, gender, and sexuality. i'm not saying the hollywood censorship codes were a good thing, but they certainly forced filmmakers to become much more clever."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"A very fun time. Some honestly wonderful special effects, too."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"An absolute classic! Really. To have created this film in 1931 is astounding. It's short and sharp, just like all those good, old films, and it's truly poignant at times. A must-see for lovers of b-grade horror and the like ;->"
0.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Bride of Frankenstein 2/10 Bring back the original characters and staying true to the original is not enough to save this movie. A complete downfall to the first, because it seemed like they rushed through making this script."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"This film was highly impressive for the time in which it was created... actually, it's fairly impressive now! And Boris Karloff is the ONLY Frankenstein's monster for me!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the few horror films that is considered a classic outside of its own genre. James Whale broke all the rules and pushed the envelope as far as was possible in 1935. Brilliant.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,I find this movie scary and disturbing. It sucks that smomeone had to die in order to create life. the reasoning behind that is sickening
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"James Whale totally outdid himself, it's one of the 100 best movies ever made. An artistic triumph!"

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"The greatest gothic horror film of all time. The jewel in the crown of Universal's classic monster movies. Spooky, atmospheric, touching, you name it, it's in here. Only an actor like Boris Karloff could have made this monster sympathetic. A great, great film."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Brilliant. Dr. Frankenstein's trying to get out but Dr. Praetorious keeps dragging him back! btw, this is a tremendous step in the development of ""the sequel."" Whale and his cohorts were wise enough to grow the world, rather than remake the first picture..."

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,A masterpiece that amazes even today.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"James Whale's masterpiece genre film. This film is remarkable, not only because of it's stunning black and white cinematography, but also for it's heart, whimsy and influence. This is the film that Tim Burton aspires to make. It won't happen."

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Un classique. Cette suite est encore mieux que le premier √É¬©pisode (1931). Une somptueuse photo en noir et blanc, un monstre on ne peut plus convaincant et une histoire qui n'a pas pris une ride. √É? voir."

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Better than the first in my opinion. Sad as hell.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the few occassions that a sequel is better than the original. I also like how Whale took elements from Shelley's original work and inocrporated it into this film.

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"A great classic, not really spooky as funny, though"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Few films so deftly mix stark horror and bizarre comedy. It's also one of the best movie sequels of all time. Watching The Bride of Frankenstein every year on Halloween night is a tradition with me.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"This film is a prime example of a sequel that surpases the original. Loe all Universal horror, but this is by far the best!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Taking the first film to a whole new level.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Better than the first Frankenstein. It attempts more of everything and gets more.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"This movie has everything! It's funny, touching, powerful... the only thing it isn't is scary! But that's perfectly okay! It's a great movie and it's got my all-time favorite film score."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"My first movie with Chet, PJ, and Kevin; Good times!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Required viewing for horror fans!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,A sequel that truly deliver's what we love about the original.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"In a way, I like this better then the first movie but won't make sense without it. Elsa and Boris are great!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"The best film from Universal's classic horror cycle, and far superior to the original. James Whale outdid himself."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Stunningly modern mix of humour and tragedy. Endlessly re-watchable from the arch prologue to the weird conclusion. James Whale knew a thing or two.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"The first sequel to truly top its orignal. Beautifully shot, haunting score and very funny, this is the best of the classic Universal Horror movies."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Creepy and atmospheric, this movie is fantastically entertaining."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"The greatest sequal ever. One of the greatest example of theater transcribed to film. Boris Karloff is amazing... He is why I did theater , all because of this film"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Absolutely gorgeous film. I think I enjoyed this one more than Frankenstein - more emotional by far.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"This flick walks the line, man. You're gettin chills one minute(if you let it, it is creepy), and laughing the next."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Much better than its predecessor. The movie has a more personal touch and is more stylized. Overall, it's a much better experience than the first Frankenstein."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Very odd. But at the same time very good. Universal never had a flop with horror films in the 30's.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Classic Universal Horror. This one is the best of the three Karloff films, which is saying a lot. There'e a bit of whimsey here, but it's dark, brooding and fun. The Bride is devastating and the monster SPEAKS!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"""Bride of Frankenstein"" was a terrific improvement over its predecessor. It added character, conflict, and a great score, and Whale made one of the best sequels in history."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,This movie is surprisingly fantastic.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,This is a rare case where the sequel is better than the original. Best in the series.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Amazing sequel. Equally as classic as the original.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"""Gin. It's my only weakness."""
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of my favorite classic horror films.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,James Whale at his best!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"James Whale hit cinematic gold with his sequel to Universal's smash hit Frankenstein. From Karloff's sympathetic portrail of the monster to the grandios sets, Bride improves on the original in every way."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"One of the best sequels ever made, no matter what movie series you consider."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"I saw one scene: the final one. I take its memory out and fondle it every half moon. Knocked me on my ass. Beautiful. Walesevolved expressionism into the horror genre. I am a pedant, a monster far worse than Boris Karloff any day."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Although not a horror film, this movie is one of the best films from the 30s. Holds up EXCEPTIONALLY well."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,This is the best horror movie of all time.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,It's my only weakness...
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Definately the best Frankenstein movie.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Because of this movie I have spent the last 19 years of my life wanting to be the Bride of Frankenstein...Thank you Elsa Lanchester!!!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,My all-time favorite horror/monster movie. 'nuff said.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,The Best Universal Horror picture made
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"One sequel that blows the first out of the water. Even though the first one is wonderful, Bride of Frankenstein is just a better film. It goes by faster, it's more entertaining, it's touching. Haha"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the best movies ever made.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the few sequels ever to surpass it's original in everyway!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Arguably better than the original Frankenstein, The Mummy and Dracula, James Whale's second Frankenstein picture is a masterpiece of gothic horror. As re-animated babes go, Elsa Lanchester's ""Bride"" is hot as blazes. Too bad she didn't feel the same about Karloff's ""Monster"". A perfect film."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Tops the original in every way and may be the best damn horror film of all time. There's just so much entertainment value here, it's incredible."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,A brilliant sequel that doesn't take itself too seriously. Tim Burton owes a lot to this movie.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"The greatest of all of the Frankenstein films, and the greatest of all the Universal Monsters Collection! James Whale ?s direction is superb and is far ahead of any other film around that time, and Boris Karloff gives the performance of his life. Masterpiece!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Better than the first.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"One of, if not, THE best horror movie ever. One of the first to use humor in the story as well, if only they had kept the additional poltlines in, but this is where the monster really shines"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Just one of these movies you¬¥ll see over and over again, laughing every time"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Nothing like seeing Elsa Lanchester in full dress as the bride!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Better than the original Frankenstein (which is hard to top) ""Bride of Frankenstein"" is... chances are, the best film to come out of the Universal Monster Era (alongside the original)"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Great, but I'm sure young people will hate it."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"The greatest sequel, better than the original Frankenstein, even better than the book."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Probably the best of the classic Universal Horror films.

1.0,1010679-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,"One of the first remakes of a movie that is equally good as the original. In this case, that means it's perfect."
1.0,1010679-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,"Waaay cool. I haven't seen the original, but this one is a classic in its own right. Check it out."
1.0,1010679-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,I love this film! The idea that Aliens can replace humans by cloning them is pretty worrying! Donald Sutherland leads a strong cast as well!
1.0,1010679-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,scared the crap out of me but good
1.0,1010679-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,"Way to see hawkeye in this remake, very good."
1.0,1010679-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,Donald Sutherland looks so fresh with his tight 'perm' My grandfather made the same mistake in 1978; I was only four years old and that shit traumatized me fo' life.
0.0,1010679-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,I liked the original version much better!!
1.0,1010679-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,"the remake is killer... the 90's remake of the remake is even good.. but what a cast... sutherland, adams, cartwright, nimoy, goldblum... absolute paranoia to the hilt."
0.0,1010679-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,"I'm not really sure why this movie is so highly thought of. I fell asleep half way through because it's pretty slow. Besides that it has undertones of cold war ridiculousness. I don't know, just didn't do it for me."
1.0,1010679-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,"Sweaty, paranoid, political, genuinely scary; I reckon this is the definitive version"
1.0,1010679-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,"Awesome sci-fi remake of the 1956 classic, with great visual gags and scary sequences, and an ending that goes for broke."

1.0,1010679-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,so very disturbing and bizarre. a truly wonderous trip into a mesmerizing and paranoid world. to my knowledge no ther film has attempted to tackle alien invasion in such an affecting way
1.0,1010679-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,Invasion of the Body Snatchers is the film that captures the psychic fears and hopes of our times like no other.

1.0,1010679-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,Better than the original....one of my favorite movie endings ever...
1.0,1010679-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,One of the very best remakes in cinematic history. Even scarier than the original version.
1.0,1010679-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,Probably one of the best remakes ever. Very creepy.
1.0,1010679-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,"One of those rare times where the remake is better than the original. This movie expands the material into something of epic proportions. The result is a creepy, dizzying study where the hangups of the ""me generation"" go straight to hell."
1.0,1010679-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,One of my favorite zombie flicks.
1.0,1010679-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,this was the first scary show I watched and it scared the bejesus out of me.
1.0,1010679-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,The best of the remakes. The final scene is unforgettable.
1.0,1010679-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,"a sophisticated version of a recurring nightmare i used to have as a kid. i'll only watch horror films if they're like this one - paranoid, pessimistic, allegorical"
1.0,1010679-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,Great movie- hella creepy
1.0,1010679-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,A wonderfully subtle film that manages to chill on a low budget. There is a subliminal creepiness to the way in builds tension. I don't think that this film is a cold war metaphor like the original. It's more about alienation and being out of touch with other people.
1.0,1010679-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,"This is fantastic, lots of suspense - great ending - always sends a shiver down my spine."
1.0,1010679-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,"A re-make that actually does it's predecessor justice. ""Invasion"" is in brilliant, living color and with improved sound, camera work and dialogue, it stands strongly on the bar of what modern thrillers in it's genre should aspire to be.  Why the hell can't more movies be like this?"
1.0,1010679-invasion_of_the_body_snatchers,"The best version of Body Snatchers. Jeff Goldblum and Leonard Nimoy share the screen. O rhapsody, o bliss!"

1.0,looper,awesome futuristic thriller Sci Fi and action rolled into one
1.0,looper,Well paced. Interesting storyline.
1.0,looper,"One the most entertaining and smart movies I have ever seen. Smart and not overly violent either. Great for anyone for anyone who is new to studying the art form of great cinema as its not mainstream at all, but can still be enjoyed absolutely by a regular audience."
1.0,looper,An excellent cast raises this movie to elite level behind a great plot and lots of thought provoking moments.

0.0,looper,"Entirely predictable and cliched. Seen this story or a variant of it, a hundred times, its popularity baffles me,"
1.0,looper,Awesome Sci Fi thriller. Joseph gordan-Levitt and Emily Blunt stood out in their roles to me. That one scene where he falls from the porch was amazing. Also the cid's acting was surprisingly good. the story was cool and i loved the ending when he killed himself. It was a sad but necessary ending.
0.0,looper,so so so stupid the only way to get rid of a body in the future is to send it back in time ? come on if you could go back in time then it would be just as easy to disintegrate on. i know its only a movie but what a waste of time the science was all wrong

0.0,looper,"Real let down, enough of an idea for a short story, not a 2 hour film."
1.0,looper,"When you have two actors like Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis together in the same movie, nothing can go wrong. I was expecting a thrilling science fiction chase through time, but Looper gave me that... And much more."

1.0,looper,A great story. Thoroughly enjoyed this film. It was an interesting plot and engaging. Would recommend it.
0.0,looper,"Personally, I was not impressed. Good acting + good action, but the TT logic was just blah. For those who contemplate on theoretical time travel, the entire film was non sequitur; at least as far as my logic takes me. Lots of glitz & Glam with very little substance."
1.0,looper,"With Joseph Gordon-Levitt & Bruce Willis Both Giving Intense Performances, Looper Shows How To Darken The Usually Light Time Travel Genre."

1.0,looper,Amazing movie with one of the best endings ive seen in a long time! Sheer brilliance
0.0,looper,"unresolved plot holes , convoluted make-up , train wreck foul in all sense of the many words of stink. Made to look cool but it felt like watching a alcoholic mother abandoning her child to buy hot pants."

1.0,looper,"Such a strange movie, got pretty weird. But In a good way, very mind teasing with the time traveling and the ending was sweet!"
1.0,looper,Joseph Gordon Levitt.
1.0,looper,A fun ride from start to finish.
1.0,looper,"Rian Johnson is not your average filmmaker. Director of arguably the greatest television episode, ""Ozymandias"" from highly the acclaimed drama, Breaking Bad. Johnson delivers once again with a great film and top notch acting"
1.0,looper,"Bloody, gritty and stylish in all possible areas, Looper is pure entertainment for the sci-fi, action and thriller audiences alike, one no to be missed."
1.0,looper,Rian Johnson has yet to disappoint. This is his most layered film yet. Great story. Great acting. Great characters. Just plain great!
1.0,looper,"Another ""DON'T MISS"" Science Fiction thriller. Bruce Willis makes good choices most of the time (this is one). Emily Blunt is great as always and though this film contributed heavily to Joseph Gordon-Levitt's portfolio it's not his best performance (adequate)."
1.0,looper,One of the most original science fiction movies to come along in a very long time!!
1.0,looper,"We might find out some 'Time-Paradox', but during seeing, we're absorbed.Joe's last choice lets us think 'what is my life?'"
1.0,looper,"Excelente. El dominio con los movimientos de c√°mara fue preciso y una exquisita presentaci√≥n para el espectador. El hecho de cruzar al veterano Willis con el ""joven"" Levit fue una gran jugada. Sin duda, una de las mejores pel√≠culas de acci√≥n de los √∫ltimos a√±os."

1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,"Another revisit of a favorite. Great, but flawed, film. Some of Dreyfuss's breakdown plays too broadly. Blu-ray really shows the flaws in the 70's era anamorphic optics and high-speed film stock."

1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,"This movie is hard to explain, but it does fall into the ""film epic"" category. It's a very long, very slow, very intriguing look into a man who becomes obsessed with aliens - who aren't necessarily as bad as we make them out to be."

1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,They just don't make them like this anymore. Spielberg's signature sense of wonderment has perhaps never been so prevalent in any of his movies as it is in Close Encounters. Five musical chords have never packed so much punch

1.0,pans_labyrinth,Detailed review to follow.
1.0,pans_labyrinth,"Beautiful and tragic. Perhaps Guillermo Del Toro's finest work. A dark, chilling fairy tale; as if a Grimm's fairy tale blended with a Lewis Carrol story in a Guillermo Del Toro nightmare. Tim Burton wishes he could make a movie this good. Ok any director wishes they could make a movie this good."
1.0,pans_labyrinth,Really beautiful movie

1.0,seventh_seal,"The Seventh Seal, a film of grim and haunting thoughts on death, pain, and agony"
1.0,seventh_seal,"The harder you try to wrap your head around it, the less you'll truly appreciate it. It's best to watch ""The Seventh Seal"" for what it is: a cerebral and existential portrait of crusade-era Sweden that stands as a solemn reminder that death comes for us all."

1.0,seventh_seal,"A knight ponders the meaning of death in a land gripped by the plague. Be wary playing chess with a pale fella dressed in black, there is plently of comedy to offset the heavy themes. The film contains some of the most iconic shots in all of Cinema and the Criterion collection release looks great."

1.0,seventh_seal,"With an intro from the book of relevation, Bergman summits his tale of ""dance of the dead"". Imagery so alive and breathtaking, filled with core-deep faith philosophy. A journey towards the jugdement day, filled with horror, humor and irony. One of the very best films ever made."
1.0,seventh_seal,A true masterpiece. The opening scene with the chess game has become a well deserved classic.

1.0,seventh_seal,"Truthfully, I don't really understand the metaphor and message in The Seventh Seal. But The Seventh Seal is a stunning and beautiful masterpiece which will bring you a philosophical journey."

1.0,seventh_seal,Way ahead of its time...really draws you in...
1.0,seventh_seal,"Bergman's best, and an excellent pictorial explanation of Christian vs atheistic existentialism. Max von Sydow and Gunnar Bjornstrad are outstanding and the black and white cinematography breathtaking. A movie you can never forget. The score for this one should be 100%."

1.0,seventh_seal,"No foreign film has been so ingrained into popular culture, and though it's sad that it can't help but overshadow Ingmar Bergman's other masterpieces, Seventh Seal earns its spot."
1.0,seventh_seal,"A thought-provoking, character-driven drama on the purpose--and futility--of life."
1.0,seventh_seal,"The seventh seal may very well be Bergman's most prolific work of his career, which is saying quite a lot . It helped to launch his career as a notable and respected director of foreign films. His mezmerizing classic has transcended time with a message that still feels relevant even today."

1.0,seventh_seal,"Ingmar Bergman's grim masterpiece fluently esteems good and evil with minimalism and assurance - it is a profound creation that echoes such wisdom as the Bible, as Shakespeare, as philosophy to produce its own theatrical language."
1.0,seventh_seal,"A profound spiritual film by one of the masters, one of my favorite films of all-time."
1.0,seventh_seal,"The final scene of everyone, hand-in-hand, dancing off into the distance, has stuck with me since. It's powerful."

1.0,seventh_seal,I need to watch it again because I was in a trance during first viewing.
1.0,seventh_seal,A classic and a film not well known but the images of death have been immortalized.

1.0,seventh_seal,Best movie about the anxiety of death.
1.0,seventh_seal,"Thought provoking and raises several relevant questions. The filming, acting and the symbolism make this a great work of art as well as an enjoyable movie."
1.0,seventh_seal,An undeniable classic. Those who don't like it should just lose a game of chess against Death.
1.0,seventh_seal,"The bar was raised by Bergman when he made the seventh seal, and very few directors have been able to come close."
1.0,seventh_seal,"""The Seventh Seal"" explores a topic used in movies so many times that today it would seem dated. That topic is facing death and not knowing how to react. Everyone has done it. But even if ""Seal"" was released tomorrow, it would still be as fresh, beautiful and perfect as it was in 1957."
1.0,seventh_seal,Max von Sydow is so stupid doesn't he realize he IS God?
1.0,seventh_seal,What could be more difficult than trying to keep your cool as you await death to make is movie in chess that will determine if you live or die.
1.0,seventh_seal,"Outstanding film about life and death and the thin veil that separates them, using Medieval symbolism with great efficiency. It's like a moving Albrect D√ºrer."
1.0,seventh_seal,One of the *classics*! I love Bergman films!
1.0,seventh_seal,"""We must make an idol of our fear and call it God."" -Antonius Block The knight, Block, wishes to transcend belief to know God, that God actually exists beyond Death. Here lies his journey."
1.0,seventh_seal,"How is it possible that this film doesn't have a 100%? This film is probably Bergman's biggest achievement. I personally like Wild Strawberries better, but this is a movie that you will have to end up watching if you want to be even the slightest bit efficient on movies."
1.0,seventh_seal,"Though it has dated a little (okay a lot), this is still one of the most challenging and thought-provoking films of the 50s (and provocative if you are a believer)."

1.0,seventh_seal,"Bergman's dark, high-art masterpiece, is an enduring paragon of world cinema..."
1.0,seventh_seal,An eerie film with great insights into religion and human life- all set amidst the simple premise of a game of chess against Death himself.
1.0,seventh_seal,"Entered to the list of my favorites movies without blinking; touched and saluted one of my deepest thoughts I had hidden for long time on my black diary, is the no ending fight that everybody have to referee between fantasy and reality, God and Death!"

1.0,seventh_seal,The personification of death in this film is lovely.
1.0,seventh_seal,"I'd never seen this. I was genuinely moved by and enjoyed every minute. I guess that surprised me. I thought this would be good for me, but not necessarily enjoyable. I watched Bridesmaids right after this. That means something. But I don't know what."
1.0,seventh_seal,"A knight returning from the Crusades plays chess with Death in a countryside stricken with the plague. Great gloomy masterpiece that bludgeons you on the head with the message ""you're going to die... no one can save you... and it's going to be HORRIBLE."""
1.0,seventh_seal,"What's to say that hasn't already been said about this one? It's a beautiful observation on God, faith, and life, executed stunningly by Bergman. While I prefer The Virgin Spring (of Bergman's work that I've seen, which isn't nearly enough), this is as good as cinema gets."
1.0,seventh_seal,Amazing film. Great movie about how to deal with death. this film is up high on my list of favorite foreign films.
1.0,seventh_seal,"Having finally seen it, I can say I was surprised by the amount of humour as well as the nuance to Bergman's typically spiritual subtext. Other than that, the stunning scenery, chilling score and cinematography, and... oh, you know, it's a masterpiece. Sheesh."
0.0,seventh_seal,"I didn't like it. At all. I usually like films dealing with themes like this. I usually like a little twisted and surreal films, but I didn't like this very much at all."
1.0,seventh_seal,Death always wins. Death is always around the corner. The answers only come from Death. The sanest characters in this film are indifferent of God's existence entirely. A legendary masterpiece.

1.0,seventh_seal,"Visually striking, sombre but also often (darkly) funny tale of life, plague and death ravaging Sweden in medieval times. Iconic chess scene with Knight Von Sydow and Death is not to be missed."

1.0,seventh_seal,An apocalyptic feel permeates the entire film; this film is also one of the most well-balanced films I have ever seen: nearly every scene is shadowed by another scene of an opposite emotion.
1.0,seventh_seal,Such great film. The chess game is one of the great battles of cinema. Bergman's best film.
1.0,seventh_seal,"A haunting, compelling work."
1.0,seventh_seal,"is a master piece definetly, Ingmar wonderful"
1.0,seventh_seal,The movie is a masterpiece as it is very philosophical in it's views on death and the meaning of life as it takes you through the journey of a knight returning from the crusades in a game of chess with Death.

1.0,seventh_seal,Ainda vou considerar o Bergman como um dos melhores cineastas de todos os tempos
1.0,seventh_seal,"Thought-provoking movie full of metaphors about life and death, light and dark, good and evil, and heaven and hell. A complete work of art that allows for individual interpretations of the questions it asks."
1.0,seventh_seal,A ton of Bergman's dialogue is deceptively straightforward. It was fun listening to my inner optimist and fatalist on opposite shoulders come to quite different conclusions about the Knight's search for purpose in an unforgiving universe.
1.0,seventh_seal,"Un cavaliere incontra la morte, ma prima di soddisfarla vuole trovare Dio e il senso della vita, cos√É¬¨ prende tempo sfidandola a scacchi.

1.0,seventh_seal,"Bleak, shadowy cinematography combined with the menacing presence of Death at every corner, life filled with half-hallucinations of divinity and the common madness of mankind, it's Bergman at his finest."
1.0,seventh_seal,A movie everyone should see before they die .
1.0,seventh_seal,mmmmmmhmmmmm! love love love
1.0,seventh_seal,Pure art.This is the movie that should remind everybody ther is a directory we all must learn from and know about.I saw this movie for the first time during philosophy class at high school.Thanks to my professor and to Ingmar.

1.0,seventh_seal,Classic Swedish film.
1.0,seventh_seal,you can't escape death... or can you?
1.0,seventh_seal,"Bergman's masterpiece that so many directors have copied his work. This is quite a unique and creative piece of work that needs a second viewing to see and experience so many images and meaningful moments of death, religion and even comedy."
1.0,seventh_seal,"Swedish knight returns home to plague ravaged country. This iconic Bergman movie, apparently panned in Sweden for its theatrical acting, is one of the great foreign movie classics for the subtitle crowd."
1.0,seventh_seal,One of the greatest films ever made. It think it is the best ive seen by bergman (i saw other 5 directed by him)
1.0,seventh_seal,"excellent excellent excellent, now Bill & Teds is so much clearer"
1.0,seventh_seal,Why aren't the first six seals available on DVD?
1.0,seventh_seal,"Nothing like what I expected from this film, but it still blew me away. I want to watch it again just because I think more of it would sink in. Bergman made an extremely deep film, but what would you expect from a film that has ""Death"" as a character?"
1.0,seventh_seal,"A true cinematic masterpiece; it's subtle, intriguing, and one of the most thought-provoking films I've ever had the pleasure of viewing."
1.0,seventh_seal,"Misanthropic, bleak, grim, and yet hauntingly beautiful and majestic, The Seventh Seal is a masterpiece of film."

1.0,seventh_seal,This movie was abso-incredible!
1.0,seventh_seal,"A very somber and melancholy film all the way throughout (although it does take place during the Middle Ages while the black plague is sweeping Europe). Bergman always uses some sort of self or primal doubts in his films, but I think this is the most successful at conveying that. Masterpiece."
1.0,seventh_seal,No other movie has spiritually moved me as much as this one.
1.0,seventh_seal,"So much as been said and written about The Seventh Seal already that I would be unlikely to add anything particularly eloquent or insightful to those comments. Suffice to say that this is a must-see film. Also, the Blu-Ray presentation by Criterion is absolutely stunning - top notch."
1.0,seventh_seal,Another film that everyone should watch. Many times while I was recording this movie has saved my computer.
1.0,seventh_seal,This Bergman classic is a new favorite of mine. I especially enjoyed the knight's confession scene. Highly recommended.

1.0,seventh_seal,"I was very young when I stumbled across it on TV. I didn't know anything about Bergman back then, no one told me it was a masterpiece, so I was totally unbiased. And I was mesmerised. I didn't know films could do such things to the audience..."
1.0,seventh_seal,"It's ominous, philosophical, yet... oddly funny at times. It's the best of master director Bergman's work I've seen so far. And Max von Sydow and Gunnar Bjornstrand aren't too shabby in it either."
1.0,seventh_seal,"A knight comes home from fighting in the Crusades during the period of the Black Plague and begins to question his faith in God and his actions; engaging in a game of chess with the Grim Reaper himself.

1.0,seventh_seal,"I never get tired of this film, definitely one of my favourite films of all time."
1.0,seventh_seal,"It would be blasphemous to give this movie less than five stars, I suppose. I found it to be a great catharsis."
1.0,seventh_seal,"No matter how many times Bergman (and this film in particular) is parodied, the genius of his philosophy and vision still holds up even 50 years later."

1.0,seventh_seal,really a beautiful and cerebral movie..fell in love with Ingmar Bergman after watching this movie.

1.0,seventh_seal,A master work. A must see and newly rereleased to Blu-ray. We are proud to bring this eternal masterpiece back to the big screen at Cinema 16:9!
1.0,seventh_seal,"Spoofed in BILL & TED'S BOGUS JOURNEY, this is the film that made Ingmar Bergmann the campus cult director of the 1960s and launched Max von Sydow's long career."
1.0,seventh_seal,"el juego entre la vida ya la muerte es sencillo de entender, si lo juegas."
1.0,seventh_seal,"A knight and death face each other in a game of chess, but is is much more then that. This is basically about the fear we have with death. I love this movie for many reasons, but watching the knight overcome the fear of death. This movie is not for everyone, but is should be!"
1.0,seventh_seal,Who else but the master Swede Bergman could make a movie where one bloke challenges Death to a game of chess so profound?
1.0,seventh_seal,Great! One of the most beatiful film ever made!

1.0,seventh_seal,"Love is as contagious as a cold. It eats away at your strength, morale... If everything is imperfect in this world, love is perfect in its imperfection."
1.0,seventh_seal,"Brilliant and beautiful, and still much more humor than people expect from Bergman"
1.0,seventh_seal,The first and best Ingmar Bergman film I've seen. A knight from the crusades challenges Death to a game of chess for his life when approached and told that it is his time to die.
1.0,seventh_seal,"Beautiful, thought provoking, and pretty much perfect. Max Von Sydow plays Chess with Death so he can find his purpose in life before his inevitable death. Funny in places, very direct in its questioning of God's existence and the exploitation of the weak by organised religion."
1.0,seventh_seal,"Bergman's trademark crisis-of-faith seen as a medieval morality play. A stunning and sometimes playful use of genre to work on philosophy, and truly deserving of its status as ""one of the best films ever made""."
1.0,seventh_seal,"This film forces you to wallow in your mortality. Chilling and sober, with a light touch of dark humor, most of the humor a not so gentle reminder of how we often try to cheat death."
1.0,seventh_seal,I'm actually quite a good player!

1.0,seventh_seal,"This was absolutely amazing! I actually watched it for two days in a row, and am now considering a thrid day.....hmmmmm. But I don't to that, I just can't stop watching it!"
1.0,seventh_seal,"In this classic film a Swedish knight freshly returned from the Crusades plays a game of chess with death. Death enters the contest knowing that his victory is inevitable, but the knight ""wins"" in the end because he wasn't playing for his own life. Powerful story about the value of self-sacrifice."
1.0,seventh_seal,You can't really understand this movie until you enter the second half of your life.

1.0,seventh_seal,"Even though it is not the most entertaining movie in the world, it is a piece of cinema that you can really sink your teeth into and is very thought provoking. Excellent acting with an excellent storyline and just a twist of humor thrown in for good measure."
1.0,seventh_seal,"This resonates over and over and over. It's brilliance is not so much the chess games with Death, rather the juxtapositioning of these quiet-calm interior scenes against the exterior horror and misery of plague and poverty.."
1.0,seventh_seal,"A sublime meditation on life and death that'll surely take more than one viewing to fully appreciate. Surprisingly funny, too!"
1.0,seventh_seal,"Classic Ingmar Bergman, for those who like a movie that makes one think"
1.0,seventh_seal,"It's actually been a while since I've seen this, but having a family member struggle with a catastrophic illness brought it to mind, and the metaphors suddenly have more impact than ever. Ditto for Wild Strawberries, Winter Light... just about the entire Bergman ouevre."

0.0,star_wars,"The movie was extremely generic, lacked character development to the point that if every single one of the main/supporting characters died I would not even be close to caring. Lucas as a director failed to deliver a good or even an original plot which was very disappointing."

1.0,star_wars,"As a film, in 1977 it was by far the most original creation in terms of cinematography, costumes, script, music, artwork, actors, actresses, and lighting. Audiences were fully entertained, including, and this is my most important point, non-science fiction fans."

1.0,star_wars,Arguably the best of its genre.The most influential sci-fi space opera of all time. And it's just the beginning because Empire Strikes Back and The Return of the Jedi are even better.
1.0,star_wars,"Easily my favorite of the bunch. Iconic, action-packed, and amazing"
0.0,star_wars,Overrated. Honestly all of the characters come off as punk ass whiny white boys/cunts.
1.0,star_wars,The start of the legendary franchise. Although it came out 10years before my time it's easy to see the impact it had on the way blockbusters were made ever since. The Mythology behind these films is so good its had generations hooked for nearly 40years.
1.0,star_trek_11,"Can't compare a 2hr movie to a 3 season / 80 episode series + all its morality. Nevertheless it is still Star Trek in all sense. Grateful to see some of Star Trek best OG characters again, may they live on forever."
1.0,star_trek_11,Awesome reboot. Must watch for sci-fi fans.
1.0,star_trek_11,One of the rare reboots that many can say as superior to its source. Abrams took it upon himself to direct a talented cast and lead the iconic Star Trek label to new heights.
1.0,star_trek_11,"The actors all NAILED their character. I couldn't have been more happy with the movie. Saw it with a few (stupid) people that think star trek is lame, etc, and they were all big fans of the movie."
1.0,star_trek_11,You can say anything you want about J.J. but he saved Star Trek.
0.0,star_trek_11,Absolute crap. Complete dreck. Generic action sci-fi with the Star Trek name slapped on it. An entire franchise raped to death by Jar Jar Abrams.

1.0,star_trek_11,"I so much love the story, costume, the ship designation and all the characters, Sulu, Scotty, Bones, Chekov. Spock is amazing."

1.0,star_trek_11,love the sci-fi adventure.
0.0,star_trek_11,Not impressive enough as a restart of a franchise other than seeing youth . Especially the FX which failed to keep the viewers' eyes wide open.
1.0,star_trek_11,Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto really nailed it as Captain James T. Kirk and Spock. The cinematography was fantastic and I loved this movie! It deserves five solid stars!

1.0,star_trek_11,"Star Trek 11 (2009) makes an argument for not only being the best Star Trek film ever made, but also for being the best sci-fi film made in the 21st century. With epic sequences and fantastic characters, this J.J. reboot turns out to be a lot of fun"
1.0,star_trek_11,Fantastic! JJ Abrams rocks.

0.0,star_trek_11,good all star trek are good series movies
1.0,star_trek_11,Abrams did a great service to the franchise when he rebooted Star Trek. The re-imaging of the design of the U.S.S. Enterprise gave the iconic starship a brand new look while paying homage to the classic design. Fun yet cerebral.
1.0,star_trek_11,"Simply great, JJ Abrams does a fantastic job at bringing back the long dead Star Trek franchise with great action and interesting characters."

0.0,star_trek_11,"I'll say it: I don't get Star Trek. Not just this movie, but all of Star Trek as a whole. I don't connect to it, no matter how hard I try. I don't care what's happening, no matter how hard I try. Is this a good adaptation of the series? Probably. I'm just the wrong guy to ask."
1.0,star_trek_11,Effing Awesome. One of the few movies I'll see in theatres more than once. Has something for everyone!
1.0,star_trek_11,"Chris pine is undoubtedly the star in this amazing reboot, featuring the crew of the USS Enterprise for a new generation. Tremendous visuals immerse you into the world and the intelligent plot will keep you hanging. Truly one of the best Sci-Fi films ever made and best reboot."

1.0,star_trek_11,"Perfect movie. Original, exhilarating and splendidly entertaining while also being everything Star Trek should be and a little better. Gets a bit confusing with the multiple Spock thing, but makes more sense after a rewatch. Doesn't feel like it's getting old."
0.0,star_trek_11,"I gave up on this movie due to one of its main actors, Simon John Beckingham. I am boycotting the Peggster because of his Fall 2015 New York Daily Blunder."
0.0,star_trek_11,"A very poor restart of the star trek universe, whoever thought ditching FIFTY YEARS of star trek history for this should have been fired."
0.0,star_trek_11,One of the single worst movies ever made. It is completely ruthless and thoughtless to its source material. If you like this movie your not really a Star Trek fan. This movie is terrible and only exists so that JJ Abrams could prove himself worthy of Star Wars 7 which was ok
1.0,star_trek_11,"Destiny in a foreign time and space that forges a unlikely group of fleet to band together. Why we greatly need a leader and those behing them. calculation and spontaneous decision making. Destiny we choose to follow, we understand it comes with some sacrifice."

1.0,star_trek_11,"The reason why the original Star Trek works so well is the comradery between the characters. This reboot does not forget that at all. Kirk and Spock's opposite personalities mesh so well together; add an action packed, well written story and you have Star Trek gold!"
0.0,star_trek_11,"at best an OK movie. but with that said the movie is a hollow sham. the plot is laughable, the set it complete my stupid, and the ships engine room looks like the inside of a beer factory. basically not worth watching if you were raised watching the show and original movies"

1.0,1013970-miracle_on_34th_street,A family classic whose sweet idealism is coupled with a canny sophistication about the nature of self-interest. Combine that thematic power with a superb story that has aged remarkably well over the decades and you have an powerful film that has stood the test of time.
1.0,1013970-miracle_on_34th_street,Edmund Gwenn is the best Santa Claus ever captured on film. Period. His performance is what makes this a five star film.

1.0,1013970-miracle_on_34th_street,Great Christmas movie and a surprisingly clever plot. The movie isn't overly sappy and the story takes some surpising directions (is he crazy?) Edmund Gwenn makes a good Santa and Natalie Wood's debut as the non-believing girl is also nice.

1.0,1013970-miracle_on_34th_street,"The greatest feature of Santa Clause ever told, doesn't much address that Christmas is about Christ, but plays to the budding commerical whims of Macys, (the idea of a fat Santa Clause), and the beginning of modern postwar commercialism. Made America feel good again at the time."

1.0,1013970-miracle_on_34th_street,"Truly one of the best Christmas films ever made, right up there with It's a Wonderful Life, and Muppet Christmas Carol.And this is another movie that they never should've tried to remake... it just doesn't work."

1.0,1013970-miracle_on_34th_street,"THE ultimate Christmas movie. Nathalie Wood's acting, who was only 7 at the time, is amazing. The movie was pretty modern for 1947, dealing with a story that had a single divorced mother in it."

1.0,jodorowskys_dune,It is a great documentary and I wish they had made the movie. Jodorowsky did gather a fantastic team.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"After Reading Herbert's Dune I had to watch Jodorowsky's Dune and wow.. Most crazy thing to learn was that I 'saw' most of the artwork it inspired already, through the reading of the Metabarons & the Incal. What a great & inspiring man. i hope one day they'll make this movie, in some form."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Ain't it amusing that the documentary on Jodorowsky's potential DUNE was far better than the actual DUNE we got from a ball-clamped Lynch?
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,See great creative leader in action & where many iconic Sci-Fi came from.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Dune could have been awesome with this documentary showing on how this would have been a pioneer to all Science Fiction films! Truly incredible
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,This is a such a well-crafted and inspiring doc that I found profoundly heartbreaking and awe-inspiring. Watch it with your cinephile friends or even a date- you're gonna end up at an all-night diner drinking coffee and talking about it.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Fantastic, so disappointed this movie was never made."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,TRULY brilliant and inspiring.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Incredible and amazing! Anyone interested and loves films should watch this. A must-see. Dune must be made Jodorowsky's way.
0.0,jodorowskys_dune,I WATCH EVERYTHING! Kind of a historical conversation but very fabricated. The guy was claiming genius. It took an army to create Dune!
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,One of the best docs. I've seen in a while. The saddest part about this movie is that it made me think of Jodorowsky's age and that someday he'll die and I'll have to live the rest of my life without another one of his films.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,This may be one of the best documentaries I've ever seen. The stories of assembling of his team right down to the designs are so engaging and interesting. His Dune was really something special that never happened and actually this movie makes you admire him more as a film maker after watching it.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Oh what might have been! M√É¬∂bius, Giger, Salvador Dal√É¬≠, and Chris Foss. It would have been transformational. Instead we got that piece of excrement from David Fucking Lynch, the worst director in Hollywood history."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"I really felt for him, the joy and pain of creating. I love the Dune that is, and am intrigued by the Dune that could have been. I wonder what it would have inspired in me at 11, had I seen it instead."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Amazing! a great story about a passionate filmmaker.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Maybe we've not been prepared to see that picture yet. The story goes on.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Amazing documentary about the never completed movie project of one of the masters of surrealism and metaphysics-fiction. Jodoroswky far from being a master and a legend is an advanced soul never accepted or understood in the prostituted mainstream scene.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,An amazing glimpse into the unproduced vision of Alejandro Jodorowsky.
0.0,jodorowskys_dune,We just rented this documentary based on the high rating. It was extremely disapointing. We love documentaries however definately not this one. Boring interviews with boring people talking about how profound this movie making project is to them. Nothing happens so dont waste your time!
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Wish someone would make jodoroskys version of Dune.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,me and my dad love it
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Fun look at the would-have-been making of Dune. Though, I would much much much rather have seen the actual movie!"

1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"how come he didn't hire a spiritial warrior accountant to keep the cost down? still, pretty damn inspiring"
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Najlepsie scifi ktore nikdy nebolo natocene
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,It was interesting to see how Jodorowsky envisioned a film version of Dune. I had read about how there was a fun being planned in Brian Herbert's biography of his father and this film shows the process and how close Jodorowsky was to completing the film and how it would have looked.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Must watch for sci-fi fans.Would have been an amazing film!
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Film as it is is definitely not a masterpiece, but to see this crazy person and his visions come alive is probably most inspiring piece of film I have seen"
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"I burst out in tears when I saw this, absolutely amazing documentary."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Wow. Would have been the best science fiction film ever! Learned so much about how ahead of his time Jodorowsky was and how everyone copied his work afterwards. Excellent documentary.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,brother in arms. forever dope.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,This will never be a movie and that depresses me.

1.0,jodorowskys_dune,My favourite ever documentary. An absolutely spellbinding look into the creative genius and passion behind Jodorowsky's Dune. A truly remarkable and inspiring film.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Don't think it can be made as it would have been back then with that crazy bunch but i'd still wanna watch it if it does

1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"It doesn't only serve as a brilliant documentary about the greatest film never made, but also as a message to every ambitious filmmaker in the world and as a burst and reaction towards the extremely conservative nature of Hollywood. The world missed one of the greatest films ever."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Fantastic, please let him create a kickstarter, I wish so much that he would finally make it. He can have all of my money, just make it."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Proof that there is no limit to the imagination!
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"The story of an audacious, maddening, brilliant film that was never made. Jodorowsky will infect your mind with possibilities and you will never forget him."

1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Jodorowsky's Dune is a fascinating examination of a maverick director's attempt to make his passion project - an adaptation of the classic sci-fi book Dune. Showing the creative process and the business side of moviemaking, it emphasizes the back and forth of crafting such an ambitious project."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Inspirational, funny, entertaining, and just an overall perfectly crafted documentary. I seriously wish Dune was made ugh."

0.0,jodorowskys_dune,Lame... unless you're on drugs at the time.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Fantastic documentary of a grand vision that Hollywood wouldn't make. It gives you a lot to think about. The novel in my opinion was the best sci-fi book ever written. Jodorowsky's take would have been a sight to see.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Thanks for give us an excellent journey.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,I hope some day someone can do that film. Like Jodorowsky.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Divertida y por completo enferma, las situaciones planteadas y las an√©cdotas contadas hacen por si solas un documental memorable."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Brilliant! Hollywood needs more artist and less accountants. Oh what might have been. I would love to see his vision in a CGI animated movie.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Jaw dropping, heart breaking, and incredibly inspiring."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"the best docu about the film you will never see,,, in this dimension at least!"
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,The failure of the Dune's project lead by Jodorowsky is just as big as his ambition with this project. Still today this movie remains a ground breaking movement in the Science Fiction movie genere. Even if it never came to be.This is by far the most inspiring documentary I have ever seen in my life.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"I hate what Hwood does to art and dreams.This must be made, one way or another."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,The story of the greatest film never made by an unsung genius. I will gush about this film and of Jodorowsky endlessly. We owe 30 years celebrated films to this man's passion and unrealized dreams.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,a tragedy this movie has never been made. the amount of dedication and ambition put into it and not then finalized is a loss for everyone.

1.0,jodorowskys_dune,What a brilliant man. I have mad respect for this guy!
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Few films dazzle and enthral with their ideas quite like this one. Jodorowsky's Dune offers an intriguing insight into a unique vision of the greatest sci-fi never filmed, made all the more captivating by the passion of Jodorowsky himself."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Gotta give this a full 5 stars, because this man's enthusiasm on every level... artistic, spiritual, life, etc. is so infectious... that alone is worth the price of admission."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Wow! What a visionary!!!
0.0,jodorowskys_dune,Weird does not begin to describe this. I have never been more thankful that David Lynch directed Dune rather than the tragic disaster this would have been.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Based on my Giger and O'Bannon's Alien obsessions, I had been somewhat aware of this failed film . What I was not aware of was how spectacular and insane, and unique it had been. One of the best studies of the human imagination you'll ever see."
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Would love to see his version of Dune on the big screen!
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Insight into a mind of movie that was never made but did so much.

1.0,jodorowskys_dune,Jodorowsky. What a guy! Fab documenrary about a movie that was (sadly) never made. Interesting and inspirational. You'll think about it long after you leave the theatre.
1.0,jodorowskys_dune,"Fantastic to think what this group of artist luminaries could have produced with Frank Herbert's masterpiece. One thing that bothered me though, seems like half the people involved in the almost-making of this movie never read the book!"

0.0,1010792-its_a_wonderful_life,Well it is definitely not a wonderful movie.
1.0,1010792-its_a_wonderful_life,"Maybe the best holiday film of all-time. There's some real magic at work here from Frank Capra, which is timeless. I almost tear up at the finish every time. I would say, however, that George Bailey probably owes his child's teacher an apology."
1.0,1010792-its_a_wonderful_life,"It's interesting to know that this timeless holiday classic actually wasn't a hit when it first came out on Christmas 1946, but was eventually embraced by millions. Cary Grant was considered for the role, but he was busy filming another excellent film, The Bishop's Wife, playing the angel Dudley."
1.0,1010792-its_a_wonderful_life,It's more wonderful every year I watch it. What makes me marvel at this film so much is how hard it would be to nail all these notes with a modern film.

1.0,1010792-its_a_wonderful_life,"Contrary to popular belief, I love this film because it's terribly depressing. Even with the love of family, Bedford Falls is the best you can hope for--for me, this is about settling, and while I might not agree with the message the story is told uncommonly well."

1.0,1010792-its_a_wonderful_life,"They just don't make 'em like this anymore. Jimmy Stewart: the epitome of weakness and strength, goofy likability and romantic sweeper of feets."

1.0,district_9,This movie was truly amazing
0.0,district_9,"Bluntest, most ham-fisted approach to social commentary. Incapable of any subtlety, District 9 is happy to dishonestly present pseudo socio-political themes, and shove them down the toilet to focus on grotesque caricature and bland, juvenile, simplistic science fiction."

1.0,district_9,One of the most original and exciting sci go movies in a long time

0.0,district_9,"First 10 minutes promised an imaginative provocative story with clever reportage techniques and interesting photography. Sadly, it all goes downhill thereafter."
0.0,district_9,Graphics were awesome. That is it. The movie was so full of F bombs it became completely unwatchable. I watched a commentary on it and it seems the more the movie went along the less the main actor stuck to the script.
1.0,district_9,Not enough humans could be blasted to bits.
1.0,district_9,Such a great movie! The story kind of starts as a news story and I think the writer was trying to show early on that the public's perspective based on the media can be far from what's actually going on. Highly Recommend !!!

1.0,district_9,I have not seen anything so original in years. You begin by hating the main character. Then you enjoy seeing him become a victim of an infection and then you're pulling for him at the end. And did I mention this is a sci-fi with stunning graphics that takes place in South Africa.

1.0,district_9,"It was refreshing to see a SciFi movie that turns the genre on it's ear. The movie is fantastic in it's realism, with even the most over the top special effects believable.

1.0,district_9,One of my favorite movies. Super awesome action and effects.
1.0,district_9,"Excellent, you actually feel bad for the aliens"
1.0,district_9,"Great movie. it really bothered me though. I couldn't stop thinking about all of the terrible, callous occurrences long after watching it."
0.0,district_9,"I going to start banning Peter Jackson movies. First King Kong and now District 9. I think it would of have been better if it had taken place in the United States, and have the aliens not look like cockroach people who eat cat food. I give it a C- and thats being generous."
1.0,district_9,"Another masterpiece from Peter Jackson (LOTR). The story could stand alone successfully, but what really sets this movie apart from other modern sci-fi is its allegorical nature. Replace the word ""prawn"" with an oppressed group, and you have a civil rights film. Terrific film."

0.0,dawn_of_the_planet_of_the_apes,"So awful! Stop watching halfway through and just fast-forwarded. Just couldn't stand how predictable it was, how syrupy and mawkish, just nonsense.

0.0,the_hunger_games_catching_fire,"It was extremely boring, i am a fan of the first one but this one was the same you already knew what was going to happen in the end so that is why I have to say it was extremely boring"

If you are an action fan, you might be disappointed of the arena battles, which are not as entertaining as the battles in Part 1. But nevertheless, the film impresses with great actors, fascinating scenes and a really dark atmosphere. A Top-Film!"
1.0,the_hunger_games_catching_fire,"I hesitate here, but this film is nearly perfect. Major props to Francis Lawrence for following the book word for word rather then trying to spin it off in a different direction. The book was made for an incredible movie, no point in changing it at all."
1.0,the_hunger_games_catching_fire,This movie was way better than the hunger games I felt like there was more depth to the characters and it wasn't just some movie set and Francis Lawrence stuck to the book more than the first hunger games movie.

1.0,spiderman_2,An outstanding instalment to the franchise. Fantastic storyline with good character development and a really good feeling from the film. 10/10
1.0,spiderman_2,"The only issue with this film is the standard it set for superhero films from then on. The best performances, the coolest-orchestrated fight scenes and the leaning away from a pompous, Russian-esque asshole to a badass corrupted ex-man Doc Ock."

1.0,spiderman_2,A sequel that improves on the already great predecessor.
0.0,spiderman_2,Hated it first time I saw it just a big over the top love story! Disliked Toby Maguire as Peter Parker and wasted one of the best comic book villains by under using them!
1.0,spiderman_2,BEST SPIDERMAN MOVIE. PERIOD
1.0,spiderman_2,"''Spider-Man 2'' is and, in my opinion, will remain one of the best superhero movies of all time. With Alfred Molina who steals the show as the main villain, great action sequences and fight scenes and also great character development, this movie is one of the best movies of 2004."

1.0,spiderman_2,Out if the Sam Raimi trilogy I love this one Actually only like this one.
1.0,spiderman_2,"probably the last great spiderman film we'll see for a while, the new amazing spiderman is garbage"
1.0,spiderman_2,"a little batter than the first, but not much. Doctor octopus is awesome. Tobey Maguire plays a perfect spider-man, and James Franco a good harry."
1.0,spiderman_2,One of the greatest comic book-film adaptations ever put to film. Everything a sequel should be.
1.0,spiderman_2,The deepest and most resonating film in the series. It gives us an amazing villain and some truly stellar action sequences.
1.0,spiderman_2,"Another good movie, the second time around was a great sequel. They definately needed to give some sort of award for it's digital effects. The cast was not quite as strong as the first one, but it was still good."
1.0,spiderman_2,Best of the three. Dr octapus is the reason.
0.0,spiderman_2,Better than spider-man 1 & 3
1.0,spiderman_2,Spider-Man 2 ranks alongside The Dark Knight as one of the best superhero films.
1.0,spiderman_2,A classic among superhero films. The strongest of the franchise. And Doctor Octopus is surprisingly the greatest Spider-Man villain to grace the screen. Note: The extended dvd version (Spider-Man 2.1) is better than the theatrical version.
0.0,spiderman_2,Zero stars total rubbish
1.0,spiderman_2,Another of the great sequels that improves upon the original.

1.0,spiderman_2,"With impressive special effects and an outstanding performance from Alfred Molina, Spider-Man 2 builds upon what made the first installment a success, progressing the story and getting into the sacrifices a hero must make to do the right thing."
1.0,spiderman_2,This is probably the best Spider-man movie so far!
1.0,spiderman_2,Classic superhero action
1.0,spiderman_2,A awesome film to watch. Properly the best Spider-Man film that Sam Raimi has done in the series.
1.0,spiderman_2,"The best Spider-Man film ever (or at least so far). Spider-Man 2 brings excitement, action, romance and a strong villain and plot to support it, there isn't much bad about this film, and if there is, please tell me."
1.0,spiderman_2,Review coming soon....
1.0,spiderman_2,The movie that all other comic book movies have been trying to top and so few have even come close.
1.0,spiderman_2,"With a greater sense of heart and overall character development, Spider Man 2 is what a sequel should be like. Improving on the plot, greatly improving on the dialogue, and impressive fight sequences, Spider Man 2 is the greatest movie in the Marvel universe that will ever exist.A+"
1.0,spiderman_2,Raimi focuses more on action rather than origin in this solid sequel.
1.0,spiderman_2,"One of the best sequels ever made. Spider Man 2 is even better the awesome first movie. The romance is genuine, the villain is a real threat and the action is great. Spider Man 2 focuses a little more on Peter's powers failing and him trying to improve. It's a great follow up to a great movie."
1.0,spiderman_2,"The sequel focuses more on Peter Parker than it does on Spider-Man. As such, there is a surprisingly good blend of pathos and great action sequences. A good deal of praise definitely goes to Alfred Molina, the puppeteers and CGI experts who make Doc Ock one cool tragic villain."
1.0,spiderman_2,"One of the best films I have ever seen. It lived up to the hype it was producing and proved to be the best summer film. No action film, especially not a spiderman one, will ever be better than this one. It stays consistent, builds momentum, and has its dramatic and tensing moments."
1.0,spiderman_2,"The best of the serie, Spider-Man 2 is one of my favorite super-heros movie of all time, with a developped villain and a mesmerizing performance by Mr. Maguire."

1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"10 out of 10:A very strange telling of the classic story but asides from that, Beauty and the Beast has great acting, impressive effects and makeup, and some beauty and tragedy are thrown in."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"The Most magical version of this timeless tale, and brings Disney to it's knees, giving the moral a much deeper meaning."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,I love Jean Cocteau's soulful surrealism and I love the movie. Watch it!
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"A work full of magic, charm, despite being old, has more spirit than many other current films."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,timeless classic Cocteau's vision was seriously ahead of its time. One of my all-time favorites.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Jean Cocteau's film is filled with truly magical moments. It has always and will continue to hold a special place in the hearts of many film lovers. It must be seen to fully appreciate.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,the best fairy tale adaptation ever.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,The best with the means one has.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Est-il possible de resister au charme de Cocteau?
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Even today, is the masterpiece that defined every future beauty, deep immersed in symbolism and the language of (true, high, mysterious and chilling) fantasy."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,A fairy tale toled by a poet. Surreal and soulful. My great enjoyment (to my slight chagrin) of the Disney version has not taken away my astonishment at the beauty of this film. On my all-time Top Ten list.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"it was amazing! I just watched it and was awestruck,, Must watch.. a masterpiece.. THe effects were unbelievable!"
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Cocteau's take on ""Beauty and the Beast"" is a gorgeously stylized and thematically complex adult fairy tale."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"A wondrous and beautiful film. I wouldn't call myself captivated by it, as I am with other films, but calling it anything less than film magic is simply unfair. Truly a work of art."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,It's a surrealistic version of beauty and the beast that creates even more of an impression because of the lack of technological advances.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"I almost find this version of the classic story to be more impressive than the animated one, not only because the special effects were on par (if not better) than any of the ""Universal Monsters"", but that the addition of the ""evil sisters"" made Belle seem like that much more of a hero."

1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"In his own words, Jean Cocteau was a poet. This film doesn't make sense, but I guess it's not supposed to: it is surrealist art. It has to be seen if for no other reason than its iconic art direction and costumes (designed by the couture house Lanvin)."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Une vraie merveille ! 1h30 de po√É¬©sie. Malgr√É¬© les ann√É¬©es, ce film reste la plus belle version du conte... Merci Cocteau."

1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,A beautiful film that becomes even more amazing when you realize that it was filmed at the end of the Second World War. The juxtaposition of fantasy and the reality of the war around it is truly amazing
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Wow, if you haven't seen it, see it. Disney owes much to this timeless classic. Jean Cocteau shows us seemless visuals of a beauty and standard that are few and far between these days. Simple, elegant, imaginative story telling for a absoulte master."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,This movie turned me into a Jean Cocteau and Henri Alekan fan. Visual magic and the story to go with it. It's hard to believe it was made over 60 years ago.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Enchanting like nobody's business.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Insane...watch it if only for the candle holding arms in the wall
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"i didn't like this too much at first, but it grew on me. now i must own it."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,I love this 1946 version of Beauty and the Beast more than the Disney version. The special effects done for that time period were amazing. One of my all time favorite movies.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Amazing. The simple techniques of reverse and slow motion make the film enchanting.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"I honestly love this film! The lanterns are something else! I wish I had an amazing castle like that! Turn off the subtitles though, that's the BEST way to watch! it's french duh! :D"
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Cocteau at his peak.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Haunting, mysterious, and dreamy. It has aged, but somehow maintains a strange power about it."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Wow...this is such a fantastic, beautiful telling of one of my favorite fairy tales. It's in French, but there are subtitles of course. And the special effects might be old-fashioned, but that makes it all the more magical instead of holding it back."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Cocteau maintains the psychology and mysterious fairy tale beauty of the original story, and throws his own ideas, inventions, and images into the mix. Pretty much the best movie ever."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"It's terrif. The acting is superb, and the special effects put today to shame. Especially when you consider they were getting all their stuff stolen, since it was right after the war."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,A great work of imagination.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"She cries diamonds, and this was made in the 1940s. No CGI, just pure movie magic."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Sheer magic. Cocteau shows why he is considered one of the great artists of the 20th century. His imagination and technical prowess in this film are unparalleled. 10/10
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,so beautiful! i watched the whole film on the french channel with no subtitles
0.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Wow. I went into this fully expecting to love it, since Beauty and the Beast is one of my favorite fairytales, but I find that I can't understand what all the hype is about. Maybe I expected too much?"
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,The best cinematic adaptation of this story and one that inspires again and again. Definitely a fantastic flick for preparing to watch Pan's Labyrinth or Legend.
0.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,I watched it and was a mix of bored and weirded out all the way through.
0.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Seen it but didn't really like it..
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,I saw this before and after I read the story in French and it still continues to amaze me. Cocteau is a poet and Marais perfectly captures his words.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Mesmerising. Its dreamlike atmosphere and beautiful mise en scene virtually lulled me into a trance. Unlike Cocteau's earlier surrealist ""Blood of a Poet"" (1930), this movie is surreal in aid of creating a fairytale atmosphere, to enhance a story."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"The most beautiful love story ever told indeed! It mesmerizes with every sparkle, tear, every glance from the beast!"
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"A really wonderful film. A lot better than I thought it would be. The story is beautiful, timeless, and classic. It's a masterpiece!"
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,so beautifully done.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,The original is always better.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"So dark, so beautiful, so magical, so French. A real conte de f√©es."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Find it, watch it, you'll be pleased."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"A wonderful adaptation of the story, all the strange bits of folklore are there, as well as the natural terror and disgust one would feel when first confronted by something which was neither human nor animal (something noticeably lacking in the America cartoon)."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"It's a visually beautiful film. Anyone who needs pointers on art direction should check this film out (as well as ""Kaidan"")."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"A masterpiece, very different from the Disney cartoon version. I like them both, but the Cocteau version is much, much better. The atmosphere is very magical and haunting, and Cocteau's effects are plain awesome. I prefer Orpheus, but this movie is also one of my favorites."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,One of the most beautiful movies ever made. This is no happy Disney film with singing and dancing; this is a dark fantasy that is engaging throughout and stunning in its design.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,This is the film Disney turned into a musical. I love it as much as I love disney's version.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Wow. La magia del cine est√° encarnada en el collar.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Magical! It's one of the most fascinating movies you will ever see!
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"GREATness beyond greatness. Cocteau is a visual genius, can't wait to see more of his stuff"
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,ahead of its time - beautiful! C'est Magnifique!
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Startling, aching beauty and incredible invention keep this a fairy tale on the edge."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Better than the Disney film, Cocteau knew how to make a great Fantasy film. Rather than rely on High Fantasy elements like the hero's quest, his use of surrealist and bizarre visual art preceded films by directors like Guillermo del Toro."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,must see brilliant cocteau film
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"One of the most beautiful things I have ever seen. The whole film feels like some beautiful dream, filled with perfume, music and magic."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"awesome series,ron perlman,linda hamilton"

0.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Waste of TIME!! Very Weak movie, DO NOT WATCH, if you do end up watching it, side effects may include: Suicide, murder ramapages, road ramapage, any kinds of ways of harming yourself, and many others..."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"Excellent fantasy film, that is worth a look if you take your fantasy flicks seriously."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,I love the music throughout this musical. A very good job!
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"60 years old and still absolutely amazing. the story touches me, the effects impress me and the make-up is second to none - go see!"
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Another classic fantasy from Cocteau!
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Brilliant. Maybe the best fantasy film ever.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,A beautiful film. After seeing the disney version it feels more like the traditional fairy tale than a childish remake. the beauty of black and white is really put to good use.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,My #54 film of all time. The absolute best telling of this classic story.
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"okay, who cried during this one; i wanna see hands"

1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,Great fantasy film with Cocteau's incredible effects
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,"This film is such a gorgeous, rich masterpiece, in the sense that it is a visual poem. Despite the abrupt and very unnerving editing, it remains THE most beautiful film I have seen. I just showed it to my film club tonight."
1.0,1001902-beauty_and_the_beast,The definitive version. Forget that Disney carp.
0.0,the-evil-dead,"I honestly do not understand how this movie has a 95%. It is a completely asinine and worthless mess of a gore-fest with extremely kitschy and genuinely stupid parts to it. Even ""Airplane!"" had better 'special effects' than this load of garbage. One of the worst movies I have ever seen."

1.0,the-evil-dead,"Classic, old school, perfect."
1.0,the-evil-dead,"Nothing compares to this cult-classic, the originality of it is outstanding. Although this is the most serious in the trilogy (Army of Darkness being the third), it still is hilarious as the amateur filmmakers learned what they were good at. This is the gold-standard in B-Movie movie-making."
1.0,the-evil-dead,want to see i like the way the grils did went they chance
0.0,the-evil-dead,Honestly don't understand the appeal at all. The characters are all irritating and I found myself more annoyed (both with them and the unbearable screeching of the zombie demon creatures) than scared.

1.0,the-evil-dead,mostly I deplore remakes/reboots but this I loved and frankly love it better than the original. I saw Army of darkness first and saw evil dead after and did not like evil dead but when I saw this in the theater with friends I have to say I like what I saw.spectacular update.

1.0,the-evil-dead,"Undeniably, one the most unique horror films ever made. Sure, it's cheesy and not scary. But that doesn't mean it wasn't artistically made. Sam Raimi's delivers a new way of filming, while Bruce Campbell is being his slapstick best."
1.0,the-evil-dead,"I didn't think I would like this as much as I did. The build up that I got from my sister made me think it would be worse than it was. I loved it. For it's time I believe that it was quite the horror, nowadays it is still creepy but not as terrifying as I was told it was."

1.0,the-evil-dead,"The evil dead is a crazed, low budget spook that may be funny in its ""dark humor"" range but its originality, added with its low budget effects, and old timey, sounds, makes evil dead impressively a serious one-of-a-kind scare"
1.0,the-evil-dead,"Sam Raimi's first full-length film is a relentless, gore-filled, cheesy horror film that set the standard for relentless, gore-filled, cheesy horror films. The laughs and scares are constant and, despite the hammy acting, the movie is just tons of fun."

1.0,the-evil-dead,"Sometimes I wanted to be scared but couldn't resist to laugh at the movie's cheesy acting and bad makeup. How they portrayed Ash in the beginning made me literally laugh it loud.

1.0,the-evil-dead,Give me all the CGI horror remakes in the world but the original Evil Dead is proof that low budget horror can stand the test of time and still entertain immensly! It may have some of the cheesiest acting and low budget special effects but this classic horror is in a realm of it's own!
1.0,the-evil-dead,"A superb cult classic! camp, guts and cheese included."
1.0,the-evil-dead,"Delightfully combining an over the top gore fest with supernatural creepy crawlies and a richly dark comic vibe, ""The Evil Dead"" not only proved Sam Raimi's finesse as a filmmaker but also sets it's foot in the ground as one of the most distinctly original and enjoyable horror romps of all time."
1.0,the-evil-dead,"legendary and iconic, the fact it was Sam Rami's first movie is nothing short of extraordinary. The effects and ""CGI"" are laughable by today's standards but takes nothing away from how really disturbing this movie really is and still stands the test of time"

1.0,the-evil-dead,I enjoyed it more then the original
0.0,the-evil-dead,"It tells no story, it's not funny, or scary, the plot holes are numerous, the characters have no development and you never feel anything for them. It's nothing but a poor excuse for a gore fest and an even worse excuse for a movie. Skip it."

1.0,the-evil-dead,"Despite it's ridiculous actings and outdated effects, The Evil Dead is a creepy horror movie, that can make you jump from your seat and then make you laugh out loud due to it's sillyness and black humour, Sam Raimi's debut ended up being in one of the greatest cult horror films ever made."
1.0,the-evil-dead,I absolutely love this 80's cult classic. Finally a zombie scary movie I actually enjoy. Yes there are things that seem cheap production but Raimi and Scott Campbell do wonders for me in this flim. Can't wait for the 2013 edition.

1.0,wonder_woman_2017,fantastic fun movie Gal makes a very convincing Wonder Woman. seen it multiple times very fantastic superhero movie
0.0,wonder_woman_2017,Literally the first movie that I had to sign up for to vote how terrible it was. This writer/director combo need never make a movie again and DC comics is done.
1.0,wonder_woman_2017,"It was AWESOME. One of the greatest superhero movies I've ever seen. I'm a superhero fanatic and before this movie, Wonder Woman was meh to me. But then when I saw this, Gal Gadot made Wonder Woman a bad ass. I highly recommend. This movie is sooooooo good. Top 10."
1.0,wonder_woman_2017,"Patty Jenkins ha hecho un incre√≠ble trabajo adaptando a wonder woman a la gran pantalla llen√°ndola de incre√≠bles coreograf√≠as y escenas de batalla, pel√≠cula recomendada al 100%"
1.0,wonder_woman_2017,Best DC movie since The Dark Knight simple as that. It is also the first of the current DC movies that you don't need the extended edition for the movie to fix the plot holes and story issues. This is a movie that I would say see in theatres and if you don't like theatres I would buy it on blu-ray.
0.0,wonder_woman_2017,Do I really have to be the asshole that says that this movie sucks?
0.0,wonder_woman_2017,Tomatometer: 92%? Score? 89%? You are kidding? Right?With that stupid plot and Gal Gadot very poor acting this movie is way over rated... My cat is better actor better then Gal.

1.0,8-12,Probably the best film I've seen.
1.0,8-12,"Stylish, sublime, subtle."
1.0,8-12,Fellini' surreal and unconventional masterpiece that gets into the heart and mind of a filmmaker.
1.0,8-12,"8 1/2 shows the greatness of Fellini's cinematic technique in a creative, smart and beautiful production."
1.0,8-12,"It's a seminal work of interwoven dreams that is so seamlessly put together the audience often has trouble deciding what is relatity, and what is not. For most movies, this would prove disastrous. But for 8 1/2, it's a factor that is critical in the film's success."
1.0,8-12,"8 1/2 is a soaring achievement of filmmaking, possibly the greatest of Federico Fellini's career, and simply one of the most creative, challenging, and comical movies ever made."
1.0,8-12,"La vida es una fiesta, viv√°mosla con Fellini... ¬°Qu√© pinche CHULADA de pelicula!"
1.0,8-12,"This is simply genius film making - thematically and artistically. Just when I want to critique it on something, it addresses my critique with sharp self-awareness. It's spectacular to behold with memorable scenes and superb shot making. A Big (capital ""B"") film in all senses of the word."
1.0,8-12,"8 1/2 is one of the best movies about film making, within a fantasy that clashes with reality.Short answer = It's a masterpiece"
1.0,8-12,The best italian movie. The best Fellini's dream.
1.0,8-12,"The thing I loved about this film when I first watched it was that almost everything in 8 1/2 contradicts the traditional seamless story line of the conventional Hollywood film. For film makers, this is the film to watch."
0.0,8-12,The most pretentious waste of celluloid I've ever wasted my time on.
1.0,8-12,"A perfect film, that touches the reality in such a personal, but oniric way, giving you the strength to live naturally, not for the others, but to live for you, with the others."
1.0,8-12,Fellini's flaud character gets more depth with every scene. Difficult movie to process yet wonderful and fulfilling.
1.0,8-12,"A classic that indubitably lives up to the name. Staggeringly beautiful, humorous, rich, spiritual and humane."
1.0,8-12,"Asa nisi masa, so save time. Three different languages?"
1.0,8-12,"we are smothered by words, images and sounds that have no right to exist, that come from the void and return to the void. Of any artist truly deserving of the name we should ask nothing but this act of faith: to learn silence."
1.0,8-12,One of most beautifully shot movies ever! Fellini at his best. Insightful but slow at times
1.0,8-12,"Wonderful performances, gorgeous cinematography, beautiful musical score, immaculately directed and an intriguing non-linear storyline. My favourite film of all time. What more can I say."

1.0,8-12,"Fellini on Fellini, on Film, on Life, on everything."
1.0,8-12,"A splendid film by Federico Fellini, a story about a film director, drained out of ideas and without the motivation to deal with his new film. Reality and fantasy mixed during the story exploring the main character's subconscious."
1.0,8-12,A quirky avant garde dramedy about the creative struggle and art's relation to life.
1.0,8-12,back to brilliant classics....
1.0,8-12,Can't believe it took me so long to see something by Fellini. What a trip this movie is.

1.0,8-12,An author trying to find his story. I saw this movie in an art house when I was a kid and didn't get it. I didn't understand the imagery. I certainly didn't understand his problem. Now I do.
1.0,8-12,"Federico Fellini's luminous, beguiling masterpiece stands close to the apex of 20th Century Cinema."

1.0,8-12,This movie made me cry cos I thought it was so beautiful.
1.0,8-12,"It's an ineffable film. I'll just simply state that I watched it twice in a month, and once it took me 3 1/2 hours to watch it because I had so many merging thoughts and ideas coming together in my brain. It's a good sign."

1.0,8-12,One of the all-time greats. Grows richer with repeated viewing.
1.0,8-12,"Quaint, nostalgic, and fantastical. The picture of an original man-child. A great counterpart to Ingmar Bergman's Wild Strawberries. Also check out Woody Allen's tribute to Bergman and Fellini in Stardust Memories."

1.0,8-12,"Lusciously elaborate.... and a genuine masterpiece, I don't think I've ever seen a director perfect a picture of such creativity, it is an artwork in itself. Fellini blends imagination with reality so astonishingly, you wonder; how on earth?"

1.0,8-12,An strike of the ages.
1.0,8-12,"Cinema's most insane and crazy director while still being one of the most literate makes his true masterpiece with 8 1/2. This films is beautiful, horrifying, hilarious, insane, saddening, and memorizing, usually all at the same time. A filmmakers kind of film."

1.0,8-12,The best italian film in 60's
1.0,8-12,"A movie that ventures into the deepest and darkest sentiments of a filmmaker in a humourous way. With felliniesque visuals, disconnected scenes and superfluous symbolism, the whole is even more magical than the sum of its parts in a square root. It comes to an 8 1/2."

1.0,8-12,"joins the greats, like Citizen Kane and Days of Heaven, of all films. the overly use of fantasy-grotesque sequences becomes an addict for the usual audience."
1.0,8-12,I wish there were 6 star options... cause this movie would get it. Perfect in everyway.
1.0,8-12,A staggering psychological exploration of creative discord and the very fabric of genius. Awe-inspiring art. Bellissimo. 10/10

1.0,8-12,"One of my all-time favorite films, and probably my favorite Fellini film. A movie with wonderful surreal imagery, thought-provoking existential and non-linear plotline, and a fantastic score by Nino Rota. One of the greatest films ever made."
1.0,8-12,"Reality, dreams and fantasy are never explained as if it were explicit in the experience. This is in the best 5 movies ever made and perhaps the most beautiful B&W; movie ever."
1.0,8-12,"Una pelicula sobre una pelicula o sobre la vida misma. Las mujeres jamas entenderan cual es la esencia de esta pelicula que brota testosterona por todas partes, acerca del bloqueo masculino, la frustracion masculina y la ensonacion masculina en todos los sentidos posibles de estos conceptos."
1.0,8-12,What a masterpiece!!!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,8-12,"In Fellini's own words, ""Beautifully confused""."
1.0,8-12,It was maybe the most important movie for me in studying moviescience! I remember the lecture on italian film and the sequences from otto e mezzo. It was something special I had never seen before ... So I did my thesis about Fellini ...
1.0,8-12,Such a beautiful film. A perfect entrance to Fellini's extraordinary career.
1.0,8-12,"Very well directed, great cinematography, and Guido is a great character; he's very sympathetic, well acted, and has the coolest glasses and sunglasses around"
1.0,8-12,"A masterpiece in ways I can't describe, but must see again soon in order to elaborate upon."
1.0,8-12,"Intense, mind-engaging and deeply personal depiction of what it takes to be a filmmaker. I watch this film every time I have problems with creativity."
1.0,8-12,Another Top Ten Favourite for me. Marcello Mastroianni was the Italian character actor with all the flawless charisma and technique of Cary Grant. Fellini is genius- period. And this film is the smoothest of Fellini's surreal landscapes with the most emotional bumps.
1.0,8-12,If you have not seen this then you do not know film.I've seen it on my birthday and it just shattered everything i thought i knew about filmmaking or storytelling. Its a masterpiece
1.0,8-12,The rare occurrence when a film lives up to the years of expectation heaped upon its shoulders is something to remember. What can I add that has not already been said about this film? It is magnificent. It also features the most beautiful cast of women I have ever seen.
1.0,8-12,One of the best films ever made. As profound an experience there is to be had in cinema.
1.0,8-12,Visionary film and director; some of cinema's greatest dream sequences.
1.0,8-12,"God knows, how many times I watched this film...like many, many times...lost count..."
1.0,8-12,Awesome writing. The pinnacle of avant-garde filmmaking.
1.0,8-12,"The greatest fantasy in the history of film. It's also a vey mystical film because it speaks directly to my sub-conscious. And also, one can just relax and wallow in the fun of it."
1.0,8-12,"trippiest movie ever made? perhaps not, but for the mainstream viewer, yes, yes it is."
1.0,8-12,One of greatest movies I have ever seen!
1.0,8-12,Way back when...upon watching the first five minutes I finally realized someone else saw life the same way I did. Took my breath away.
1.0,8-12,Another flawless classic from Fellini. A lot of the deeper allegories were lost on me but the film is genuinely fun to watch and skillfully paced.
1.0,8-12,"This is the best film I've ever seen in my whole life. From the beginning until the very last second, it has ""brilliant"" written all over it.The film itself is beautiful. The pacing is also perfect."
1.0,8-12,Truly the greatest achievement in cinematic history!
1.0,8-12,non e' al primo posto solo perche' sono romagnolo...
1.0,8-12,"MUCH MUCH MUCH better than La Dolce Vita! I can now say that Fellini really is a fantastic, brilliant storyteller!"
1.0,8-12,Has to be my favorite of all time. No question. Stunning and poignant. Just everything a film should be.
1.0,8-12,Maybe the greatest movie of all time...
1.0,8-12,So tasty tasty tasty movie....
1.0,8-12,Like Shakespeare...watch it twice to get it once.
1.0,8-12,A foreign film for people who don't like foreign films. Art doesn't get any better or more breathtaking than this.
1.0,8-12,How can you go wrong with a protagonist named Guido?
1.0,8-12,"Not for everyone. First time I saw it I didn't understand it, but the film looked beautiful. But after rewatching it and take the time to really absorb it, you'll be rewarded for its endless creativity and thoughtful examination of humanity."
1.0,8-12,Fellini balances playful and dramatic storytelling without one compromising the other. Throw in Mastroianni and Cardinale and you got one beautiful film.
1.0,8-12,One of the moust inspirational movies I have ever seen.
1.0,8-12,"The most brilliant autobiographical work in film. Reflective, poetic, a showcase of Fellini's art and wizardry. Mastroianni is perfect in alter-ego performance."
1.0,8-12,Lives up to its reputation
1.0,8-12,**Fellini s masterpiece** the man who cant love...
1.0,8-12,Brilliant and crazy film about a director trying to reconcile his life. Images really jump out at you in this one.
1.0,8-12,Fellini... sei sempre il megliore
1.0,8-12,Outstanding film. Really hypnotic & fascinating.
1.0,8-12,"the greatest italian film? It is quite possible. The story itself is nothing great but it is the depth of each of the characters, along with some of cinema's most memorable shots that make this truly great."
1.0,8-12,"This film is highly poetic in its presentation, emitting the same degree of intensity as any of James Joyce's best writings. A must-watch."
1.0,8-12,"I swear, this film is what is inside my head, more than any other movie I've ever seen.  In my opinion, this is Fellini's best (although La Dolce Vita is a very close second), and this is hands-down Mastroianni's best performance."
1.0,8-12,"what an amazing journey into the middle-aged man's psyche...but if you watch it with the sound off, the visuals are purely breath-taking (even Fellini played with the idea in the opening scene, so why not?)...a cinematic treasure!"
1.0,8-12,A must see for anyone who needs inspiration by something completely visually stimulating.
1.0,8-12,Truly a miraulus masterpiece. A director who just couldn't figure out what to do with his movie makes a movie about a director who doesn't know what to do with his movie. This is a must see for any type of moviegoer.
1.0,8-12,"I didn't catch it all in the first viewing, but a very subtle film about love, life, and family. The main character is very rich in layers as he goes through his life."
1.0,8-12,i've been watching this movie for as long as i can remember and i never try to analyze it but rather just feel it as it unfolds. fellini is like no other and has always kept me guessing. mesmerizing
1.0,8-12,"A ravishing compendium of sights, sounds, and performances in a film that has the great Federico Fellini turn creative block into transcendent art. Not to be ignored."
1.0,8-12,Cinema has Ended here!
1.0,8-12,"A masterpiece , Love how Fellini plays with the medium in this one."
1.0,8-12,Kuvan ja ajatuksen liitto. Ajattomia pohdintoja ja kuvia. Fellinin ironia tekee 8√Ç¬Ω:sta my√É¬∂s syntisen hauskan.
1.0,8-12,Don't think I will ever finish this movie... absolutly fantastic!!
1.0,8-12,"I agree with Ebert. Film is about images. If all you want is story, go read a book. If you feel the same way, then this is a masterpiece."
1.0,8-12,"Sure, I may be a Fellini junkie, but I never get tired of this flick. Just the way the camera moves through this story is dreamy. Quite a journey!"
1.0,8-12,Fellini was a ridiculously good director and this is a ridiculously good film. I can only think of a couple that I like better than this one. Easily one of the greatest ever made.
1.0,8-12,"Ultimately, this is a really funny movie. It's obvious from a lot of the reviews here that many people don't know a comedy when they see one."
1.0,8-12,This is such a cool movie in so many ways.
1.0,8-12,Si esta no es la mejor pelicua de la historia pega en el palo.La genialidad de Fellini en su maxima expresion.Si de verdad les gusta el cine estan obligados a ver este film y las demas joyas de Federico.
1.0,8-12,"Mental opening, the best ever portrayal of a dream I've ever seen. Great."
1.0,8-12,"A masterpiece of all time, no more words. Strong charachters and Fellini's ability to ride us to a thick border between reality and fantasy. I finally understood the strong influences with T. Gilliam's Brazil."
1.0,8-12,"The more and more great movies I see, the more and more I realize how much of a mark 8 1/2 has made on my life; one that no other movie can accomplish for me."
1.0,8-12,Do you know how to love?
1.0,8-12,Classic! An Original! The cinematography has been copied over and over. Fellini's Finest

1.0,8-12,This film shows the metaphorical possibilities of film.
1.0,8-12,le finale de ce film me fait tjs pleurer...
1.0,8-12,One of the greatest movies of all times. Inspired me in so many ways.
1.0,8-12,This is possibly one of the greatest movies of all time
1.0,8-12,"By blurring the lines between dreams, memories, and the present, Fellini produces the most accurate reproduction of the experience of life ever to be captured on film. If you've ever wondered what it's like to have other people call you an artist, this film will let you live it."
1.0,8-12,The opening scene...wow. It sets a great symbol for the rest of the film. I love how the transitions between reality and surrealism become less and less clear as the film progresses.
1.0,live_die_repeat_edge_of_tomorrow,This movie was an intense blend of action and interesting ideas. I love it.

1.0,live_die_repeat_edge_of_tomorrow,One of the best and most entertaining films ever.
1.0,live_die_repeat_edge_of_tomorrow,"I love the whole concept and idea of the movie. It was almost like watching a real life video game where Cruise's character had unlimited lives.I wish it didn't have so much CGI because it kind of takes away from the realness of it all, but then again this move is science fiction so yeah."

1.0,live_die_repeat_edge_of_tomorrow,"This will always be the #1 movie in my heart. Tom Cruise's acting, the plot and action just blew me away. The film title didn't seem attractive at first and I only watched it on the plane since there weren't many options, and I was completely amazed that I've rewatched it a few times ever since"

1.0,live_die_repeat_edge_of_tomorrow,One of the most original and entertaining films of 2014. The cast are amazing and believable and the script the same. Can't wait for the prequel/sequel that's planned with the same cast because this universe is one that no one really knows anything about so they can do so much with it.
1.0,live_die_repeat_edge_of_tomorrow,"Tom Cruise shows us he can play the unlikely cowardly protagonists as well. As he does, he gives us surprisingly hilarious moments, great action scenes, a unique story, and a way to build yourself up as a better man."
