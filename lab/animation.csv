1.0,antz,'Existentialism is an ANTism.' This has to be one of the best underrated 'kids' film ever. Holds WAY up.
0.0,antz,"When you would compare it to A bug's life, you would be dissapointed how much DreamWorks has copied from it. While a bug's life is childish and funny, Antz uses excessive idiocy to make people laugh. Truth to be told it does not deserve 95%. Good actors have wasted their talents on this film."
1.0,antz,"surprise, it's a cute movie"
1.0,antz,I love the story that the creators try to tell
0.0,antz,"Antz is a movie that takes it itself WAY too literally; and after a while, not only does it become boring, but annoying."
0.0,antz,"Just because there is a prolific director voiced a character, doesn't mean you should look past the actual plot and seriousness of the movie. Blatant rip off of A Bug's Life."

1.0,antz,Great social commentary. competing with pixar even during the beginning
0.0,antz,Slept through most of it.... and gladly!
1.0,antz,A very well executed animated film that has been forgotten.
1.0,antz,"Maybe not by much appealing in color and visual but in the flow of the story and the outstanding star power voices of the the cast, for sure the 'Antz' will certainly captivate you and your eyes to keep on watching..."

1.0,antz,love this film so much
0.0,antz,Hated it....probably because it came out the same year as A Bugs Life.
1.0,antz,"The movie's higher intelligence and advanced use of it's premise showcase DreamWork's penchant for non-catering, which makes it's thematics feel more admirable, if a little alienating, considering its time and mixed appeal."
1.0,antz,Woody Allen and Jennifer Lopez made this movie funny and clever. A great family movie for sure.
0.0,antz,This movie is terrible in every way and a horrible excuse for an animated film. The film reeks of Bug's Life knock-off and was poorly executed across the board.

1.0,coraline,looks terribly interesting!
1.0,coraline,Absolutely love this movie!
1.0,coraline,"Great movie. Funny, dark, somewhat creepy, with great voice work from Fanning, Hatcher, and especially David."
1.0,coraline,"With an impressive stop motion picture and a twisted, dark and intriguing story, Coraline can not be surpassed by any other movie."
1.0,coraline,More master storytelling by Neil Gaiman. A great movie to watch for children to learn to appreciate what they have while still being legitimately scary for adult.s
1.0,coraline,Best movie EVER I have the 3D and blue ray disc
1.0,coraline,"I never going to get bored from watching this movie. Definitely it's the best ""Laika's"" movie in all ways, in my opinion. One of the best animated movie's of all time. 10/10."
1.0,coraline,"Director Henry Selik proofs, once again, that he's a master in the art of stop-motion animation, adapting with an incredible sense of faithfulness one of Neil Gaiman's most memorable works, in a dark-yet charming masterpiece; with great characters, atmosphere and superb production design."
1.0,coraline,"A truly gorgeous and imaginative stop motion animated movie, every frame is filled with beautiful colors and amazing details.The cast is great, Teri Hatcher in particular as the other mother, and there are some truly creepy moments.The score by French composer Bruno Coulais is beautiful and unique."

1.0,coraline,Great animated film that has a distinct tone that might not suit everybody. The characters are strong and the direction is faultless. The film takes an interesting turn around the midway point that is typical of the author. I can't recommend this highly enough.
1.0,coraline,"muy buena pelicula animada,henry selick es genial,me sigue gustando más el extraño mundo de jack ,pero esta peli es una obra maestra."
1.0,coraline,One of my favorite animated films of all time. Does a great job of setting up a unique atmosphere & slowly building tension as well as wonder. I strongly recommend this one.
0.0,coraline,"Worst kid movie ever. Scary, confusing, pointless, and according to my 8 year old - lame, and according to my 6 year old - an idiot show."
1.0,coraline,"Coraline is creepy, it has visuals and scenes that can easily be scarier than some horror movies out there."

0.0,coraline,Couldn't bring myself to watch it till the end....!

1.0,coraline,"The reason I am so fascinated with this movie is personal: Coraline srikingly resembles of one of my younger sisters, Dumitra"
1.0,coraline,Loved it! I know its based on a book which I haven't read but it's imaginative and the action keeps going right to the end. The ending felt a bit rushed though but it would have been too long a film if it was longer.
1.0,coraline,"It is NOT a kids movie. NOT AT ALL. That doesn't make it bad though. Instead, it's one of my top 5 favorite movies of 2009. The animation, the colors, the terror, the 3D, the imagination = S.P.E.C.T.A.C.U.L.A.R."

1.0,coraline,"The utmost pinnacle of weird and terrifying. Fantastic movie, one of my favorites. Not for little kids, though, unless your little kid has a spine of steel."
1.0,coraline,Even though it said 3D I didn't know this was 3D until I got it but it's the best movies like Nightmare Before Christmas I like. It doesn't have all the singing and I love the story and just the way it was made. It was creative and wonderful!!!

1.0,coraline,"Beautiful styling that will have both you and your child's imaginations spinning. It's not quite a Halloween movie, but is definitely a tremendous fall movie to help get everyone in the spirit. The medium, art, color, lighting, and story are tremendous. If only all kids movies where done this well."
1.0,coraline,this is the best movie ever

1.0,coraline,"Hauntingly deep, beautifully animated and intensely dark, Coraline is a perfectly realized interpretation of Neil Gaiman's novel, capturing the spirit and horror flawlessly."
1.0,coraline,A wildly imaginative and beautiful looking film. The animation was superb and the film was far darker and creepier than might first appear. There were some brilliant character designs and the music was spot on! (24.5.09) (21.10.09) (19.4.14)
1.0,coraline,"Una propuesta agradable, llena de alma y una animación deleitable hacen de Caraline una tétrica, pero dulce historia."

1.0,coraline,"A visual delight and effective piece of stop-motion animation, Coraline is crafted beautifully with somewhat spooky and stunningly imaginative cinematography that pops Gaiman's 2002 children's horror novel in mind blowing 3-D, thanks to Selick's 'just as imaginative' direction."

1.0,akira,"A phenomenal film with deep seeded socio-political commentary. However, it doesn't feel like it is too preachy, instead putting that on the back burner for some seriously intense action sequences. Beautifully animated and very intense, Akira is not to be missed."

1.0,akira,Essential viewing for fans of beautiful animation.
0.0,akira,För att uppskatta denna rulle bör man nog vara hardcore fan av Manga....jag är det inte och finner den rätt rörig och rent ut sagt dålig. Har läst några av serierna den bygger på och dom är inte oväntat bättre.

1.0,akira,"A real hallmark of animation, bolstered by its high production values and chilling dystopian vision of post-apocalyptic Neo-Tokyo, as political corruption sends this city tailspinning into utter bedlam. Katsuhiro Otomo is officially one of my favorite filmmakers."
1.0,akira,"Kubrick's ""2001"" of animes."
1.0,akira,"Katsuhiro Otomo's genius lies in linking the apocalypse with the rage of disaffected teenagers, the story is fueled by society's fear of its youth. In this respect, it can be seen as a teensploitation homage of sorts in the vein of The Lost Boys as well as the pinnacle of animated science fiction."
1.0,akira,"one of the greatest anime movies of all time. if it wasnt for this movie anime wouldnt have gone mainstream like it is today. amazing animation, gory scenes and a story line that fits a takashi miike movie. this movie is amazing on so many levels i highly recommend this movie."

1.0,akira,The god of anime films just beautiful love it up there with spirited away.

1.0,the_illusionist-2009,"Wonderfully-made. Emotionally-captured. This film is a spectacle - of its old school stylish & artistic visuals - a dying form in today's world. 'Magicians do not exist'... but people with hearts filled with magic, do."
1.0,the_illusionist-2009,"I love this movie so much. I recently watched my copy for the third time, and got treated myself to the Bluray edition. The more I see it, the more I love it. The beginning always make me laugh, and the ending always makes me cry. It has become one of my favorite movies in a very short time."
1.0,the_illusionist-2009,"Beautiful animation and a very well told story that is, ironically, told mostly though facial expressions and actions. The ending's quite a bit of a downer but that doesn't keep the rest of the movie from being smart, dramatic, and a treat to look at."
1.0,the_illusionist-2009,"Similar to Belleville in the nostalgia feel, while there bizarre and true prodigy, here magical realism and prestidigitacion (on scene and on life), prevail. An unspoken, tender and melancholic (but sober!) fable about human transformations and the wonder amidst the unspoken."
1.0,the_illusionist-2009,"Beautiful. Heartbreaking. Gorgeous beyond words. As much as I love Pixar, it just goes to show you that traditional animation is not dead."

1.0,the_illusionist-2009,"Just wonderful. Music carries the images without the need for dialogue. Characters dance through the scenes as if they weren't animated. You never think that anything bad will happen. At the end, it is difficult, initially, to tell if its a happy or sad ending."

1.0,metropolis_2002,The finest anime never to have CG.
1.0,metropolis_2002,"Another anime that kicks Disney's ass. Seriously, why don't they send the Americans out to Japan as interns. They really need to learn how to animate. Aside from that, this film is a beautiful adaptation of Osamu Tezuka's manga."

1.0,metropolis_2002,"I always get choked up at the end. It's beautiful and is a must see for any fan of sci fi. I've shown it to non anime watches and they've loved it as well. The whole film is beautifully detailed and you really grow attached to the characters, even the 'bad' guys."
1.0,metropolis_2002,Wonderful Japanese Anime. Kind of mix of the original Metropolis and Blade Runner.
1.0,metropolis_2002,"Great animation, a joy to look at visually. Touching story involved with internal politics and a crime investigation in a futuristic city. One of the great anime feature films yet."
1.0,metropolis_2002,"Story fails in some departments but I love this movie. The odd Tetzuka style, the music, the aesthetic, the Ray Charles song. Loved every second of it. Is a pillar in animation just like METROPOLIS ('27) is a pillar in live action filmmaking."

1.0,metropolis_2002,"Such an amazing movie, anyone who has done any sociology courses will like this one. I think so anyways."
1.0,metropolis_2002,Awe-inspiring to the original. I truly was engrossed in the entire plot and I loved the visuals but what works is that there is a story that accompanies it greatly. You'll love the ending for sure.
1.0,metropolis_2002,"Odd movie, beatiful and worth spending some hours of your life on."
1.0,metropolis_2002,A great film that mixes contemporary CGI-anime style with homages to the classic film by Fritz Lang and the manga by Osamu Tezuka. Love the slightly cheesy allusion to Dr. Strangelove at the end.
1.0,metropolis_2002,"I love the juxtaposition of the music - old 20's jazz - with the wildly futuristic setting of the movie. It starts out slow, but continues to pick up pace until it leaves you stunned at the end."
1.0,metropolis_2002,"Another anime Classic and must see, futuristic and dark with a plot that keeps you on the edge of your seat."

1.0,metropolis_2002,"Amazing, amazing animation - got me hooked on anime!"
1.0,metropolis_2002,"Best anime film ever, and an incredible standalone film as well. One presses play asking oneself ""Isn't this from the 20s?"" A few minutes in, one realizes that it isn't, and that it is marvellous. By the end, it is a masterpiece."

1.0,tower_2016,Really good movie. Unbelievable true story.
1.0,tower_2016,"Although it is hard to watch due to the content - this film is absolutely amazing. Not only do they show actual victims and people involved in the scene, but they show real-time animations that make it seem like you are at the shooting and it just takes your breath away."
1.0,tower_2016,Uniquely done movie and well told.
1.0,tower_2016,Solid documentary. The stories told and the art styles used were executed soundly. Tragic events of history should be documented using Tower as its inspiration as it only glances at the life of the murderer and puts the attention on the victims and 'heros.' This is a must watch documentary.
1.0,tower_2016,"One of the best documentaries I've ever seen. An event filled with stories of bravery, love, and admitted cowardice. This film beautifully recounts terrible events that unfolded over 50 years ago."
1.0,tower_2016,It's amazing how much human emotion animated characters based on actual people can convey.
1.0,tower_2016,"Mixing unique animation with interviews of the victims, and footage of the event, Tower is one of the best, and most unique documentaries I've ever seen. It's a film that shows the very worst of human behavior, but also the best of it as well."
1.0,tower_2016,"Really different with part animation, part actors and part real people from the happening that day. Very moving."
1.0,tower_2016,One of the BEST documentaries I've seen in ages. I still can't get it out of my head.
1.0,tower_2016,"Powerful documentary. With the rotoscoping animation along with the interviews of those who fully encountered the event, as well as actual footage of the event; it all blends together in a powerful way. Masterfully edited. Highly recommend this powerful film!"
1.0,tower_2016,A great way to make a movie about a tragic event. I loved the animation style and the mixture of actual footage/photography with the animation. Great storytelling style. Emotionally powerful and just great.
1.0,tower_2016,Amazing documentary. Very unique. The colors and art style used was so beautiful. The story was done justice and it had a great cultural theme behind it.

1.0,tower_2016,"harrowing and original, detailing stories of real bravery with an unmatched immediacy thanks in part to brilliant use of animation and actors"
1.0,tower_2016,"An outstanding meditation on terror, guilt, and bravery, which uses the artifice to embed current memories back into the past. And a look at the beginnings of USA mass shootings."
1.0,tower_2016,"What an impressive achievement this docudrama is, managing to redeem our species in a story rooted in the nihilism of one troubled man on August 1st, 1966, the date of the first mass shooting on an American campus."

1.0,zootopia,"I have to say that I love great animated films perhaps more than live action great films. I don't know why. I think its because, if done right they can be so emotionally powerful, like this film, and other like it such as ""Inside Out"" and ""The Lion King"" ."

1.0,monsters_inc,Monsters Inc. is an extremely great movie filled with something we all feared were in our closets and under our beds as kids. This movie develops characters that make us want to befriend monsters and not to tell our parents on them.

1.0,monsters_inc,"Monsters, Inc. is glowing feature debut for the greatest director the animation industry has yet seen, and an outrageously high-concept piece. Pixar both pushed the bounds of computer animation technology in the monsters, and created their grandest, most striking set to date with the door vault."
1.0,monsters_inc,Monsters Inc is when of the few children's films I think adults will like more then the kid.

1.0,howls_moving_castle,One of my favorite miyazaki films along with Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away. The gorgeous visuals and genuine characters more than compensate for the occasionally hackneyed storyline and abrupt ending.
1.0,howls_moving_castle,"Based on a series of children's books that I've never read, Howl's Moving Castle is poignant and tells a strong moral tale wrapped in the soul of a wizard, a witch, a fire demon, and a cursed little girl. I watch this whenever I need to feel there is hope in the world."

It's weakness, however, is the horrible final ending that doesn't sanely explain anything."

0.0,the_lego_batman_movie,This movie is not the best movie. I believe this movie is stupid. I am not trying to be mean but this is just my review. Now the Lego movie was good but this movie is just a no. Don't waste your time seeing this. The age group might appeal to ages 4-7.
1.0,the_lego_batman_movie,DREWABACCA BATMAN THE DARK KNIGHT!
1.0,the_lego_batman_movie,"AAAAH! So good! This was the first time I actually liked Robbin, and I LOVE how they incorporated the Joker... AND HARLEY QUINN! The only other movie I had seen her in was suicide squad. It is nice to see all the comics I love coming together in a Legos movie."

1.0,the_lego_batman_movie,"This Movie has it all. It has fun, wit and also it isn't afraid to poke fun at itself. It is what warner bros have been missing for a while and that's not being to serious with itself. This Movie has heart and it even includes daleks which is amazing!."
1.0,the_lego_batman_movie,Fantastic film full of comic reference jokes which makes it re watchable and actually improves on the original . Cast is funny and the score apes Nolan Batman's films

1.0,the_lego_batman_movie,"Funny, moving and all above ridiculous! Amazing kids movie and I loved the fandom references inside it (Harry Potter, Doctor Who, LOTD)! Just as good if not better than the first Lego Movie. Though I'm not a fan of D.C., this is definitely Certified Fresh that they deserve!"
1.0,the_lego_batman_movie,Funniest movie since 2015. Comedy every minute. So much action with the joker and I won't spoil for anyone else but there are a lot of familiar bad guys
1.0,the_lego_batman_movie,Absolutely hilarious!!!
0.0,the_lego_batman_movie,"Horrible! The story telling was as bad as watching two 5 year olds playing with a bunch of random action figure toys. For those adults that enjoyed the first Lego movie, don't expect the same humor, this Lego Batman is made for kids only."

1.0,the_lego_batman_movie,Loved it. The jokes were spot on and if you didn't get some I'd suggest you do some research. Haha my brother didn't get the jokes too well so I had to explain the shark spray and the prince music. LEGO movies are the rage right now
1.0,the_lego_batman_movie,This is great family fun! We took our 18 and 13 year olds and had a blast. The humor is clever and fun for several generations.

0.0,the_lego_batman_movie,not good. we like kids movies and this was worthless. Not terrible but does nothing for you. Half a star to dilute other people's ratings.
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,"The other Satoshi Kon masterpiece. In my opinion, this is his most inventive and unique work which is saying something. Here he uses his ability to tell surreal, logic-bending stories for a completely new purpose than you'd expect. It's near perfect."
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,"While Tokyo Godfathers might be my favorite Satoshi Kon movie, Millennium Actress is, to my mind, his best film"
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,Thought provoking and tragic in all the right ways
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,"Yeah, the animation might be dated and the love stories (there are two) a bit unrealistic, but what power and what great music. This is my favorite cartoon."
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,The best thing ever.
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,The reason why I believe anime can be art.
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,"Honestly, the ending made me cry. Secondly, I think this movie is beautiful, I strongly believe this is the best Satoshi Kon film. This film has such a great story and such great animation. This is one of the best anime films of the century! This film is also one of the best films I have ever seen."
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,Are you ready for a never fulfilled love story that goes through a lifetime and beyond ?
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,One of the best anime movies ive ever seen.this film blew me away. it was very original and had a great story. although its not for everyone if you like anime i suggest you check it out. it has my highest recommendation.
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,"Like Paprika (2006), Kon introduces us to a protagonist whom we follow with unfailing loyalty. 'Millennium Actress' is storytelling at its best - a study of disjointed, half-remembered memories that confront some of the more difficult epochs of Japanese history."
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,My favourite of Satoshi Kon's work! moving between past and present and fiction and fantasy as only animation can do
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,"My favourite anime. The narration technique is just so captivating, and the actress' life unfolds. Thank you for making this film, Satoshi Kon. Rest in peace."
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,A stunning piece of animated filmaking. I seriously doubt I will see another this good in a long time
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,An entirely understated masterpiece.
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,"Absolutely Loved this movie. A twisting tale of love, jealousy, and fate.Dreamworks, I really hope you will release this on Blu-Ray."

1.0,millennium_actress_2001,One of My favorite movies. also my favorite Satoshi Kon films.
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,"This is absolutely my most easily favorite movie. The storytelling concept was novel, yes. But what captured me most was the sweeping score and Chiyoko's perpetual search for the Prince of Key."
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,Weird wild stuff. Pretty incredible animation. Neat. Impressive. Touching end.
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,"Along with Mind Game, this is my favorite anime film. It has a unique structure, but you really get emotionally invested in the actress' life."
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,Satoshi Kon at his best
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,"A beautiful movie. Twists and turns are presented with surreal transitions, yet the emotions are heart-felt. Worth watching even just to see the director's way of story-telling."
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,This is a brilliant movie.
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,"""Millennium Actress"" é um anime excelente, tanto pela parte técnica e a direção, como pela história. O enredo é todo não-linear e passa por várias eras do Japão Feudal; as guerras; o pós-guerra e mistura até cenários de ficção científica em viagens interestelares."
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,"This flawless work of art excels in its music and stunning anime, but most of all it is remembered for its deep plot. Granted, you might have to see it more than once to truly ""get"" the plot along with several aspects of the movie, it is a must-see for anime fans and newcomers alike."
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,One of the finest anime ever made. Studio Ghibli for adults.
0.0,millennium_actress_2001,"O filme é original, mas também é confuso, melancólico demais, a protagonista é doente, a mensagem passada é péssima e a última fala do filme ainda consegue piorar tudo. Me senti no final desse filme quase como me senti quando assisti Requiem for a Dream."
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,By the end of this movie I cried so hard that it took me awhile to get back to normal.
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,A mind-crushing depiction of life all the way through birth to death.
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,"Movie was beautifully made! Worth watching!!!!! It could be confusing to you, but you will get it later on. Cause there's like so many different scenes going on, but you'll catch up to it!"

1.0,millennium_actress_2001,Masterpiece. Nothing more can be said.
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,"Beautiful film by an amazing director. The boundaries between fantasy and reality are practically nonexistent in a woman's search for a man she hardly even knows, yet holds a key to the most important thing in the world, according to him."
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,This movie is beautifully illustrated and well-acted. This a bitter-sweet and very moving tale of a young girl's search for a stranger which she has fallen in-love with and becomes the sole inspiration of her life.
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,Really fun non linear trip through the life of a woman through the movies she's made.
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,"I'm not a huge anime fan; however, paradoxically a few of my favorite films of all time are animated. this is one of them. Watch it, then look into the history of the films within it, and it'll become that much more amazing."
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,Another really good animated movie!
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,A phenomenal movie that will challenge you to think about perception.
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,"One of the most technically brilliant films I've seen lately. If you like Peter Greenaway or looking at narrative structure, or if you love beautiful animation, this is a must-see. Oh yes - my kids loved it, too, and found the chief narrative device hilarious!!"
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,"Though it's an anime, it's one of the best I've seen recently. I haven't been touched by a love story for a long long time......"
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,One of the saddest movies I've ever seen. :-(
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,Un temoignage poignant de la puissance de l'amour! Grandiose et bourre d'humour! A voir et a avoir!
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,"the animation, the directing, the music... all amazing."
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,a sad movie with a sad ending but wonderful animation
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,The best Kon Satoshi film yet!
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,"Satoshi Kon is easily my favorite anime film director. While it's difficult for me to pick a favorite film of his, Millennium Actress hits a great note in story and execution."
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,"In the story, the past and present and future and real and play are mixed. It's little complicated but original.This is great animation!"
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,"Amazing work ! A woman dedicates her life to finding a man she met by chance, leading her to becoming a famous actress. As Satoshi does with most of his work, you find reality and fantasy blending together."
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,"Kon's most imaginative and focused film, with loads of subtext. Not only is this the story of an aging actress' life, it's a history of Japanese cinema, as well as the history of Japan itself. There aren't many directors left with this kind of imagination."
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,so uplifting but has some sad parts..
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,"makes me cry everytime, that story never gets old, the end is a killer"
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,Great surreal mix of the past and the now. Living in another person's life all over again.
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,A love story about a woman who dedicates her entire life's work to finding the mysterious love of her life. It's a touching story.
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,"A fantastic animated movie, certainly one of the best Satoshi Kon films!"
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,Satoshi Kon's best! a masterpiece and pioneer of a new era in the history of anime.
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,Surreal and touching! The perfect blend of mystery and romance that left me in tears. Strong message and great graphics!
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,"One of the best Satoshi Kon films ever, this perticular story is so interesting and you really get sucked into the life of Chiyoko. Great film"
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,"Such a sad ending... I literally had tears streaming down my cheeks. But it was so very, very... incredibly wonderful..."
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,What an ingenious way of telling a romantic-tragic love story and paying homage to the Japanese cinema! A real gem.
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,"I really enjoyed this movie, it was interesting how her life blended with her roles and of course the animation was more than excellent."

1.0,millennium_actress_2001,"Great, an instant classic!"
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,"I don't know what to say. It was beautiful. Not action packed. Not a comedy or fantasy. Beautiful I have yet to see Perfect Blue or Paprika, but if they live up to this...."
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,I love this movie so freaking much.
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,I can't describe how much I love this film. I actually believe it's perfect...
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,fantastic storytelling!
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,Satoshi Kon's first film I think. It's really beautiful and has an interesting story line.
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,"Wow! A masterpiece, this anime is well animated and has a very interesting storyline, which reminds me a lot of the ST:TNG episode called ""Cause and Effect"". Satoshi Kon really is a master of anime."
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,"The title didn't really pique my interest but I watched it regardless. It was a simple yet powerful story and while some may think it's corny for her to chase after a love she never really knew, you can compare it to any dream you pursued that was always a little out of reach."
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,Satoshi Kon's best film by far!

1.0,millennium_actress_2001,cant believe this is animation
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,it's moving and i like the theme and the spirit portrayed by the actress
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,I liked the idea behind her being more in love with the chase than him. I had to have that explained to me though.

1.0,millennium_actress_2001,Satoshi Kon is nearly the only good thing going in anime. This film is a very touching love letter to the history of Japanese cinema. A rare piece of self reflection in an otherwise low-brow medium.
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,This is probably my favorite from Satoshi Kon. He has an amazing ability to draw the viewer in to his movies where you start to forget you are watching an animated film. This one is a very atypical love story. Something we've not seen before.
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,"Takes the art of animation to a whole new level, in which even live action films struggle to ascend."

Arguably has one of the best endings for a film of any genre."
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,"I did not know what to expect with this movie but was very surprised, This movie is a very sad amd moving tale. Brillant!"
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,"Love, memories, movies, a search that never ends. Well drawn characterizations and beautiful art/animation."

1.0,millennium_actress_2001,The music's like sunshine and clear water!! And the colour's perfect!!
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,"This movie might be a bit more straight forward than Kon's other works, but it's so diverse that it'll keep that edge of your seat feeling Perfect Blue had simply because you wonder what's going to happen next? Good stuff, great running animation too."
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,Kon's visual vocaulary provide a new discourse of what animation can be more than it should be.
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,"a total tear jerker.  I did not want to watch this film, but I'm glad I did."
1.0,millennium_actress_2001,Satoshi Kon is THA MAN!!

1.0,rango,"I have a special needs child that has watched this over and over again. The show gets more hilarious every time. Extremely clever and phenomenal animation. I rank this as all time greatest animation. Might call me crazy but I have seen it no less than 300 times, and would watch it again. Five stars"
1.0,rango,I don't know why but I enjoyed this movie VERY much. The plot was very clever and the characters very well designed.
1.0,rango,Really enjoyed this movie. This one is for big kids like me.
1.0,rango,Gore Verbinski's vision can be seen in every inch of this flick.
0.0,rango,"This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Who ever thinks this is a good movie has no taste. The acting is quite mediocre, along with the plot being dumb and unoriginal. And I thought spaghetti westerns were bad. It's just bad!!!!!!!!"
1.0,rango,it was a funny and cute movie me and my family love it
1.0,rango,"""As long as that there sign hangs.... We got hope.""  -Rango"
1.0,rango,"One of the best westerns, kids movies and animated films ever. It isn't perfect, but its damn near close in my book."
0.0,rango,This was probably the worst child movie I'd ever seen.
1.0,rango,One of Johnny Depts best performances since Pirates.
1.0,rango,Love the movie! Fun for the whole family!
1.0,rango,Exotic style of animation and different kind of showing its creativity... Near to perfect actually...
1.0,rango,One of the best movies
0.0,rango,What a bad movie. This is nothing for kids...
1.0,rango,"This is a very fun movie, but not for young kids. Hard to believe this is a Nickelodeon movie."
1.0,rango,"Amazing, funny, just a must watch. Wasn't expecting such a good movie !"
0.0,rango,I wanted to watch it because of johnny depp but..not really my type of animated movies...
1.0,rango,"Intelligent, humourous and taking a different turn with your typical kiddy movie. Rango is striking with it's fantastic script, voice acting and great direction."
1.0,rango,I like rango the movie!
1.0,rango,"A surprisingly wonderful animated film with stunning animation, a wonderful script, and a typically great performance by Johnny Depp."
0.0,rango,"It was terrible from start to finish. No like-able characters, dry acting, weak plot, just a big flop. Pretty much any other disney movie is better than this."
1.0,rango,Perhaps a weird and offbeat film but full of humor and an enjoyable story not only for kids but fro any age. Oh and I love Johnny´s western accent.
1.0,rango,It is so rare to find an animated movie with such a story and that is so hilarious.
1.0,rango,An enjoyable animated film that is entertaining for everyone!
0.0,rango,I was incredibly bored by this movie.
1.0,rango,"A very unusual movie that tries some new and ridiculous stuff. For the most part, it pulls it off spectacularly. Great voice talent, wonderful animation, and excellent soundtrack. Lots of fun."
1.0,rango,"Very good and funny move with classic references, that will blow your mind"
1.0,rango,"Best kids show for grown ups, ever. Any kids show that has the words ""prostrate"", ""thespian*"" and ""mammogram"" hidden in the detail goes beyond clever. Bravo."
1.0,rango,This is a review on 6/20
1.0,rango,a very good animate movie with a creative cast and special for all the familie.
1.0,rango,One of my favorite movies of all time
1.0,rango,great script. Unparalleled animation. And Johnny Depp. Possibly the best non-live action film there is.
1.0,rango,This was a great Johnny deep movie and he was so great at this lot .
1.0,rango,Really good for kids
1.0,rango,"This is my favorite Johnny Depp movie. Pirates? Ehhh...it had its moments. At least here, he eats from a Jar of Dirt/cigar ashes."
1.0,rango,"I loved the animation and to me every minute was originality, a refreshing maneuver away from the typical animated films of Hollywood."
1.0,rango,Funny and a little twisted here and there.
1.0,rango,"Original, creative and beautifully and comically rendered. Rango is one of the best movies of 2011 and one that showcases Johnny Depp at his flashy, unique and quirky best. And is also a surprisingly fun and entertaining tribute to the classic Western films of old. 5/5 stars."
1.0,rango,So amazing and funny!!
1.0,rango,"Its a really cute movie, my ONLY problem with it though is that watching literally makes me so thirsty lol..."
1.0,rango,Any hardcore moviegoers will love this movie. It's full of references and adult humor. Johnny Depp's voice acting is a highlight as well. This really isn't for kids or casual moviegoers because I can't imagine them getting any of the jokes. This was probably the best comedy of 2011.
1.0,rango,Loved it! Had humour depth to it & Rango is pretty awesome!
1.0,rango,This is my favorite movie ever! I can watch it over and over without getting sick of it
1.0,rango,"A surefire classic with a great performance by Johnny Depp. While I won't be in line for the next 'Pirates of the Caribbean' movie this summer its a lot better than his last movie ""The Tourist"". Great for the whole family!"
1.0,rango,"We just finished watching this movie. I am totally gobsmacked! Superb animation, endearing and wonderful characterisations, highly entertaining for the whole family with plenty of action and adventure, along with a beautiful storyline built around self-belief."
0.0,rango,Sorry this one has Johnny Depp in it.. I saw some of it but Johnny Depp couldn't even hold me.
0.0,rango,"Terribly choppy story line, mingled with pathetic humor and beautiful graphics. The critics are very wrong on this movie. It sucks, the end."
0.0,rango,I utterly despise this movie. What is the world coming to if this is what we feel the need to fill children's heads with?
0.0,rango,The Animation is discussting.I don't remember a thing.
0.0,rango,"Rango is fun for youngsters, but it's western feel is too spaghetti western for my liking."
1.0,rango,what a great movie with so many levels and so much archetypal imagery - loved it!!!
1.0,rango,This film is dripping with quality from start to finish. Absolutely superb.
1.0,rango,my fiance loves this movie because he's funny in this movie

1.0,rango,This movie is perfect for family and friends to watch with each other.
1.0,rango,"Absolutely delightful, but not a little kids' film. Much more geared to the tween and teen set, with some adult chuckles and a little raunchy humor."
1.0,rango,Hilarious and adorable! :)
0.0,rango,"Personally. this movie was so bad that the 3 year old, the adult and the stoner could not get into it at all and we turned it off after the first 30 minutes."
1.0,rango,"I am biased because I love Johnny but the film was amazing it all looked very natural, I loved it!!"

1.0,rango,By far one of the greatest CGI Animated Movies ever!
1.0,rango,U cant never go wrong with Johnny Depp
1.0,rango,"Jack Sparrow is now a chamaleon, and instead of being a pirate he is an actor pretending being a sheriff, well what I have to say about this movie is.... MAGNIFICENT! BEST WESTERN EVER!"
1.0,rango,This is the strangest film but is wonderful and realistic.Johnny Depp is great as Rango and the fantastic cast of desert critters are believable and very funny.The whole thing smacks of Blazing Saddles with Lizards and its unmissable
1.0,rango,Dark but fun for the kids
0.0,rango,"There is a fine line between being a tribute and a shameless pilferage of ideas. Rango is sadly the latter. Unoriginal and uninteresting and unfunny. I probably enjoy pointing out the movie references watching SCARY MOVIE, DATE MOVIE, MEET THE SPARTANS. etc"
1.0,rango,"Didn't expect this movie to be as good as it was, it's not what you will expect, a very good movie though."
0.0,rango,couldn't even watch all the way thru
0.0,rango,horrible movie. Boring. A few funny parts but that's it. The story was dum
0.0,rango,Did not appreciate the bad language and high violence in a children's movie.
0.0,rango,"While slightly entertaining at first, the movie quickly progresses to overly dramatic and downright inappropriate for young children. I was disappointed by the language and would have liked to see a PG-13 rating on this movie."
1.0,rango,"Great film, underrated."
1.0,rango,It's going to be a tough call for best animated movie of the year between this and Kung Fu Panda 2

0.0,rango,Predictable and boring.

1.0,rango,Really fun to watch!
1.0,rango,Not since the original Toy Story did i have such a good time watching an animated movie!
1.0,rango,"Not since 'The Incredibles' have I marveled at how incredibly good an animated film can really be if the script and special effects are first rate. The cherry on the cake for mine was the brilliant performances by Depp & Co. Blue Ray, here I come ..."
0.0,rango,I have no idea why this movie even got more then 1%

1.0,rango,The best non Pixar film
1.0,rango,"I think this is one of the greatest animated movies, but it's not for your elementary schoolers. It's a great movie for teenagers, though. And if you're an adult who's watched a lot of movies, chances are you'll enjoy the constant references and shout-outs."
1.0,rango,"Its funny, creative, and overall a really nice tribute to old western films! This film seems a little underestimated by the publc, but is still s great fun film! I reccomend this film to all, especially those who like western films!"

1.0,rango,Goes beyond just being a cartoon

0.0,rango,"why is it that the sucky movies get amazing ratings, and the decent movies get crappy stars.. makes no sense"
1.0,rango,Really good. Creative.
0.0,rango,It was ok. I thought it was a bit boring.
1.0,rango,Flawless animation and surprising Pixar style poignancy at times
1.0,rango,I've never been so grateful for water.
0.0,rango,I saw this in theaters and could not stand it. Great animation but it took me half the movie to finally get into the story.
1.0,rango,"A fantastic animation and movie and a real surprise! I didn't think I would like this as much as I did! Great humour, fantastic voice cast, great western setting and imaginative characters make this a real gem. Johnny Depp was fantastic as the lost chameleon! (7.3.11) (8.7.12)"

1.0,rango,"This was a really cool movie. Great story and amazing special effects, everything an animated movie should be."

1.0,rango,"A humble, intelligent homage to a genre forgotten with the talent of Johnny Depp and the references that he brings."

0.0,rango,not funny at all. i was disappointed
1.0,rango,"Absolutely blown away. Im no longer in the age group this movie was made for but I have to say, the theme and social concepts presented are able to resonate with all ages."
1.0,rango,"What a great, funny movie. The references to classic Westerns are fabulous. Definitely worth seeing!"
0.0,rango,"I wanted to like this, couldn't make it through the whole movie."
0.0,rango,What the crap was that! I have never been so ticked off at a movie in my life. I had very high standards for this and although it had some potential to be amazing it blew it all out the tailpipe. Sorry but that sucked a big one. Back to the drawing board.
1.0,lilo_and_stitch,Cobra Bubbles steals the show. Still a little disconcerted about the odd proportions the female characters are drawn in...

1.0,lilo_and_stitch,Best Disney movie YET!!
1.0,lilo_and_stitch,"This movie is really great. I love that Stitch is not your typical alien and it makes one realize that behind all the bad there really is some good. I also love the fact that the creators took the time to draw most of it out instead of use computers, it adds a whole new feeling to the movie."
1.0,lilo_and_stitch,"This is by far one of my favorite Disney movies. There's a sort of honesty to it that I appreciate. It has some cheesy MIB references but I must admit, it's not all the time that you have a Disney character such as Lilo being the star of the movie with her broken home and dark tendencies haha."
1.0,lilo_and_stitch,"I am probably alone on this but this is without a doubt my favorite Disney film and a childhood classic. The character of Stitch is perfect, the family aspect and overall message this film portrays is beautiful and to think this is all combined with some excellent alien butt kicking."

1.0,lilo_and_stitch,"Epic, had a very original story, which is hard to find these days, considering all everybody does now is make sequels to movies that end ""Happily Ever After.""  Plus, Stitch is pro. . . .he'd be an epic pet XD.  ummm, not much more can be said. . .watch it!"

0.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,"A psychedelic waste pit of ugly UA animation, a song the only makes sense if you are on LSD, an bad acting."
1.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,"It's visuals may not be of the comprehension of some viewers (inluding me) but that can't remove the fact that Yellow Submarine is more than a musical, it's an authentic piece of art. Even many years after it's release, it has the same magic."
1.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,Endlessly inventive animation invigorates this tale of the Beatles saving a psychadelic fantasy land from a nasty horde of invaders. The images stagger the imagination and overall the film serves as the perfect complement to the Fab Four's late 60's material.

1.0,wall_e,El futuro de la humanidad hecho pelÃ­cula

1.0,wall_e,"If this isn't Pixar's best film, then i'll eat my shoes."
1.0,wall_e,This is a gray movie all about a lonely robot called WallÂ·E.

1.0,wall_e,Still a better love story the Twilight

1.0,wall_e,"This is my favorite Pixar Film. It's creative, it's emotional, there's not a character I dislike or even don't care about, the morals are some of the best I've ever seen done for any movie. I would call it a perfect Pixar Film"

1.0,wall_e,"For a film that only had two spoken words for the first half, this film is a masterpiece."

1.0,wall_e,Wall-E and EVE told the a beautiful love story without a single word.
1.0,wall_e,Who would have thought that someone could make a truly heart felt love story with robots who can barely talk? Apparently Pixar not only can do that but can add depth and layers that few dream of.
0.0,wall_e,I know that I'm gonna get ton of hate for this but in my opinion this movie sucked and was super boring.

1.0,wall_e,Very enjoyable movie...even the tenth time!!
1.0,wall_e,"While my favorite Pixars will always be The Incredibles, the Toy Stories, and Monster's Inc., will not deny the fact that WALL-E is Pixar's absolute best and most important movie. It is a movie that truly has something to say. Near perfection. Bravo."

1.0,wall_e,"This is the best movie I have seen in soooo long! I laughed, I cried... This is totally in my top 3 favorite movies. So funny and you just cannot help but fall in love with wall-e. I grew up with E.T.... and this just knocked that out of my top list."

1.0,wall_e,"Not my favorite, but certainly the best of Pixar. There is a difference."
1.0,wall_e,I challenge anyone to watch this and not fall for Wall·e!
1.0,wall_e,"Wall-E is beautifully made and it manages to tell a love story without any dialogue at all (something which Up did the next year to the tenth degree). It's brilliant, but what keeps it from being my favorite is the perhaps overbearing themes throughout."
1.0,wall_e,Best animated film ever!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,wall_e,"Designed to tug at your heartstrings, but done with such nuanced flair, I wish I could give it a bonus star."
1.0,wall_e,A film you can never get tired of.
1.0,wall_e,It has a GREAT message and the animation is a fantastic example of how far Disney has come.
1.0,wall_e,"If you can get past the obvious politicalism and ignore the poor fat people jokes, this one is hillarious! Oh, and be sure to catch the short ""Presto"" before Wall-e starts. Get that popcorn and get seated!!"
1.0,wall_e,"Another memorable Disney-Pixar gem. A simple and well made science fiction movie that kids and adults will enjoy, along with the important message of caring for the environment, the earth, our home."
1.0,wall_e,"Tell me a movie that in the first 30 mins., that has no dialog but conveys so much within that time frame with that kind of CGI beauty?"

1.0,wall_e,"still such a wonderful/beautilful film,stunning cgi & good story with funny scenes & charactersone of the best pixar films so far, a masterpiece"
1.0,wall_e,"The movie was full of heart and it made us all turn the other sheeck, stop and think about the world for a moment."

1.0,wall_e,"Had been looking forward to this film since I saw the first trailer and was not disappointed. Once again, Pixar delivers a great love story between two endearing characters and also (though unintentionally) delivers an environmental message of what we humans are doing to our home."
1.0,wall_e,Really good n funny movie
1.0,wall_e,I cried at the brilliant emotion portrayed in this superb romance from Pixar.
1.0,wall_e,The perfect animated movie
1.0,wall_e,Another great example of what Disneys Pixar has to offer. A very moving movie even though there was no dialog. Its almost as if I could feel what Wall-E was feeling.
1.0,wall_e,The primary use of body language in this film makes it unique. The ptomaine displays it's boldness in a good light.
1.0,wall_e,"Arguably Pixar's masterpiece and inarguably one of the greatest films in cinema history, ""WALL-E"" is supremely intelligent, touching, and nostalgic, with characters and themes more poignant than most live-action pictures could only dream of possessing."
1.0,wall_e,This movie is wonderful.
1.0,wall_e,"It's very hard to pick a favorite Pixar Movie, but for me Wall-e comes very very close. The way the story is told makes you care so much for the main character's journey, which combined with mind Blowing visuals and sounds, results in a Amazing Movie! Thanks again Pixar"

1.0,wall_e,"Wall-E is a maturely conceived production that largely succeeds emotionally, visually, and intelligently."

1.0,wall_e,"Convertido en un clásico de Pixar gracias a su emotividad fuerte, escenografía e imágenes bellísimas y potentes, y una premisa simplemente perfecta. Es toda una oda al género de la animación y de la misma manera, a la humanidad."
1.0,wall_e,"Pixar had done toys, bugs, cars, monsters and superheroes. They'd already done a film set underwater. So, a film set in space with robots as main characters was an obvious choice, right? Well, they pulled it off spectacularly. It's one of my favourite films of all time."
1.0,wall_e,I love it great childrens movie
1.0,wall_e,"A love story of robots Wall-E and Eve attempting to save Earth over a plant, how simple for Pixar to make another grand slam. Also has a cool message in which you must not rely entirely on robotics to prolong your human life. It'll make you fat."
1.0,wall_e,One of my favorite animated movies. Such an interesting plot. And it looks amazing.
1.0,wall_e,Very sweet love story. A Disney film set in space. Love it!

1.0,wall_e,"A unique, creative, funny, charming, endearing, magical, and daring film by Pixar that not only pays off but exceeds with flying colors. ""WALL-E"" is one of the most original and well done animated films I have ever seen."

1.0,wall_e,Brilliant - my favourite Pixar. Feels like the most grown up film they've done to date.
1.0,wall_e,Just a perfect movie
1.0,wall_e,Probably my most favorite animation film ever. I was a sucker for a lonely humble robot doing his job and seeking love. A kind-hearted film with its necessary humor. I loved it. The action and storyline were wonderful. Great film.

1.0,wall_e,One of the most heart-touching movies I have ever seen.

1.0,wall_e,this movie was everything i expected it to be and more. really adorable!! who knew a cock roach could be so cute!
1.0,wall_e,"This just prooves that the Pixar folks are supreme storytellers. You would expect the visual greatness, but that takes a backseat to the characters. While later viewings may make me wish for a bit less commentary, and more of Wall-E exploring Earth... this movie is just plain great."
1.0,wall_e,"Amazing how they can tell such an amazing robot love story without saying a word. Beautiful visuals and heartwarming story., just the thing we expect from a Disney Pixar."

1.0,wall_e,By far the best pixar film of all time !!
1.0,wall_e,"Where do I begin? Lovely, charming, stellar images. Forget it being one of the best Pixar films, it's one of the best Sci-Fi films period. WALL-E and Eve have great chemistry together, and the way it looks is just breathtaking. And wait, it's a movie promoting environmentalism that's....SUBTLE???"
1.0,wall_e,Can't saw nothing bad about this movie. Everything was excellent!! PIXAR does it again! A Classic!! An animated 2001.
1.0,wall_e,Freaking phenomenal. The sound design is truly the highlight of Wall-E and of course it's full of beautiful animation. How did Andrew Stanton go from this to John Carter?

1.0,wall_e,"Wall -E is just wonderful, especially the first part where Wall-E is on his own just going about his daily business. Nothing else I can add to all the rave reviews it's received, except to say see it on a big screen!"

1.0,wreck_it_ralph,Wreck it Ralph is a movie for all especially those interested in video games. It's a movie that has you cracking up and feeling emotions. Ralph deals w/finding himself and its so funny how a glitch dies just that.
1.0,wreck_it_ralph,I absolutely love this movie! I believe it teaches a great lesson to anyone by saying don't let other people's views of you define who you are. That is something everyone should live by.

1.0,corpse_bride,Great movie! I've just now seen it and I really like this movie. It's a little predictable but that doesn't mean it's not good. Tim Burton did an awesome job and so did the cast.

1.0,corpse_bride,Loved it!!! Amazing film! Has a spooky twist and it has earned five star easily! Must see!
1.0,corpse_bride,"Corpse Bride is certainly one of Tim Burton's best. Deftly blending a wholeheartedly original and creative concept, beautifully Gothic visuals, excellent animation, catchy musical numbers and ultimately is emotionally touching. 5/5 stars."

1.0,corpse_bride,Great movie! I absolutely love it!
1.0,corpse_bride,"A grim if not oddly sweet film adapted from old folk tale that feels as fresh as ever. It may be a bit on the short side, but it's a fun and imaginative that carries all the signature Tim Burton finesse and charm. Not his greatest work, but still a good one."
1.0,corpse_bride,An incredibly and beatiful movie to boys and adults and with some parts with a awesome black humor
1.0,corpse_bride,Loved it! A Burton classic!
1.0,corpse_bride,It's dark and beautiful at the same time. Couldn't help but to get teary eyed toward the end when the truth is revealed.

0.0,corpse_bride,"Dreadful, absolutely dreadful. Poorly acted, poorly written, annoying, and dreadfully boring. This ""musical"" has three songs, only one of which is above horrible. The animation is decent, and some jokes land, but that can not compensate for the mess that is the rest of the movie."

1.0,when_marnie_was_there,Eye cry! One third movie! Five out five!ð??­
1.0,when_marnie_was_there,"This movie was amazing and inspirational. While there is no action, this film delivers on a heart felt story and feel good moments that almost make viewing it feel like taking a trip back in time. Definitely one to get on DVD."
1.0,when_marnie_was_there,"A very Ghibli movie! Full of sweetness without being painful to the teeth, melancholy, mystery and wonder. Very good addition to the collection of my favourite anime movie studio."
1.0,when_marnie_was_there,Stunning animation filled to the brim with peaceful moments (as always with Ghibli's films) and emotional clarity the likes of which no other animation house can achieve. A bittersweet mystery and a heart-turning wollop at the end.
0.0,when_marnie_was_there,"A garbage film, relying entirely on poorly executed tropes, an odd desire to keep its nothing twist from the reader, an oddly homosexual incestual romance, and characters so dumb you can't imagine this story stars real people."
1.0,when_marnie_was_there,Magical and heart wrenching. Worth the nearly 4 hours I waited in line to see it.

1.0,kubo_and_the_two_strings_2016,"As beautifully animated as any picture on-screen this year, movies with such rich, melancholy storytelling and timeless adventure don't seem to appear as much as they used to. What a great, great film."

0.0,kubo_and_the_two_strings_2016,"Kubo and the Two Strings may have some unbelievable animation but when it's this hit-and-miss with its humor, annoyingly restrictive in its explanation and obvious with its surprises, its utterly pretentious attitude is completely undeserved."
0.0,kubo_and_the_two_strings_2016,started off strong but all in all a weak film with fantastic animation. I feel like the story could have been so much better but they compromised it due to aiming at a younger audience. simple and boring story.
1.0,kubo_and_the_two_strings_2016,"Very good, wonderful job"
1.0,kubo_and_the_two_strings_2016,"Audiences asked for a real original, and they got one. Cultural, funny, emotional, engaging, impressive, scary, and downright breathtaking, Kubo might just be the best of Laika's films and is undoubtedly up there with Zootopia- if not higher."
0.0,kubo_and_the_two_strings_2016,"THIS MOVIE SUCKS! We see what your doing here. Trying to make this movie seem ""good"". It is terrible and is nothing good as Moana. Moana has a true theme and music that you can get to. Not to mention you can't even tell the theme. Kubo is a nobody."

1.0,kubo_and_the_two_strings_2016,This is a fantastic family movie. Complex story-line but told in a way that was easy to follow by my 6 and 4 year old. I enjoyed it immensely as well. I would highly recommend this movie. So much so we watched it twice on a rainy Sunday Afternoon in San Diego.
1.0,kubo_and_the_two_strings_2016,"While this is a ""family film,"" the basic themes are adult - community, family, death, grief, mourning, and memory. It is a brilliant, if perhaps Western Buddhist understanding of what the young hero Kubo faces with magical assistance, and which in the end we all face, all too often alone."

1.0,tangled,"Tangled is one of the BEST Disney cartoons EVER. Definitely in my top 5. I hesitated to see this until 2013 because of how bad Disney films have gotten over time. DEFINITELY WORTH WATCHING! Rapunzel is cute, Maximus and Pascal are Hilarious, and Flynn is fun. Overall a GREAT film!"
0.0,tangled,Over use of anthropomorphized animals. Way too unrealistic. Plot just doesn't make sense. Does not show true human nature - too much of a kids' movie. Glorification of crime and injustice. A disgrace to democracy by glorifying monarchy.

0.0,up,"Overhyped, Overblown, and Overrated, it can't be overstated. Animation that boast a greatness to come leaves us with unimaginative characters and a forced jumbled plot that takes itself WAY to seriously. Any genuine feeling soon becomes sappy in the run of its manipulative story telling."
1.0,up,"A clever, heartwarming masterpiece. Everything about the film works: the comedy, the story, the main characters, the side characters, the animation. Movies don't often come as perfect as this one."

1.0,up,Just amazing. The first ten minutes are heartbreaking.
1.0,up,"Any movie that can tell such a cute, depressing, and detailed story in such a short time, being the opening, is just perfect. I cried before the true adventure even began... I don't know what that says about me, but it says a lot about the movie."

1.0,up,"Simply breathaking, heart touching, PERFECT movie."

1.0,up,"Brilliant, cute, action packed emotional film with a great plot."

1.0,up,One of the greatest and most tragic love stories ever told and that is just the first 10 minutes. Up has a lot to live up to considering the opening sequence and the plot requires the suspension of belief on epic levels but Up never fails to be great. All I can say is Squirrel!!

1.0,up,"Definitely my favorite animated film. One of my favorite all-time films. Arguably Disney-Pixars most sophisticated use of theme, message, and storytelling. At times funny but never gimmicky, at times devastatingly poignant but never sappy. A true must-see film for all ages."

1.0,up,My Favorite Pixar movie of them all
1.0,up,"Exceeds expectations, even from Pixar."
1.0,up,"If I'm asked what's best of Pixar, I'll point my finger to this one."
1.0,up,Pixar does it again with this touching masterpiece. Anyone who's ever had a relative diagnosed with a fatal disease will truly connect.
1.0,up,the best kid moviefor adults
1.0,up,This is an amazing movie that proves that anybody can achieve something no matter how old. This is an amazing comedy and a great story. Pixar has done it again
1.0,up,One of the greatest animated movies since Disney's golden age. It tells an important story and deals with a difficult subject but is still fun for kids or anybody really.
1.0,up,This movie is perfect in every single way
1.0,up,nothing beats the first 10mins
1.0,up,An absolute masterpiece from the Pixar brand.
1.0,up,Best animated film in history
1.0,up,I laughed. I cried. I pretty much experienced the full gamut of human emotions.
1.0,up,"The first 7-10 minutes are movie making at its best, encapsulating two full lives in that short space of time. Amazing and deeply moving. The movie gets better from there."
1.0,up,This is 5/5 for the first 10 minutes alone
1.0,up,"by far my favorite pixar movie, possibly my second favorite animated movie"
1.0,up,"One of Pixar's best, what else can I say."
1.0,up,Really nice film can't believe I've only jus watched this.. Pixar r the best I liked the message.. Let things go and there is more important things in life.. :)
1.0,up,I always get tear up at the beginning of this masterpiece.
1.0,up,A movie about loss that leaves you uplifted. Another Pixar masterpiece.
1.0,up,"Pixar's uplifting, yet, somber tale of a widowed man whose journey of seeking to fulfill his wife's lifelong aspiration turns awry is, for a lack of a better word, a soon-to-be classic."
1.0,up,This movie made me cry and had deep underlying message. It was cute too.
1.0,up,Beautiful little love story intro and great message.
0.0,up,It tries to make you feel hope by showing you dazzling animation of an old man and a kid being really high in the sky. But there's no actual thematic elements or characterizations to make you feel this! It left me feeling more angered by fake hope rather than uplifted by real hope.
1.0,up,Great movie! Saw it with my kids and had to hide my tears at one point so they wouldn't see. This movie is way beyond expectations!
1.0,up,"Emotionally charged and very funny, this film will stick with you for a long time."

1.0,up,I love ice age 4I love up

1.0,up,this movie is very tear jerking funny and quite mature at times One of Pixar's best
1.0,up,"Stay away from 3d. Doesnt work for everyone, even if you are pixar."
1.0,up,"""Up"" is one of the deepest films from Pixar. Only the introduction of the film is enough to make you leave the tears from your eyes. Definitely ""Up"" offers more than just a colorful adventure. And it lives UP to its name... XD"
1.0,up,excellent movie. I do not rate movies 5 very often this one is a exception. very funny especially dug. Carl is a grumpy but charming in a way and Russell is the type of kid you want to adopt. all I can say is WATCH IT
1.0,up,"Loved it loved it loved it. Really not a ""kid"" movie, but kids will enjoy it since it's a cartoon and there's occasional silly stuff... really is a story line geared towards adults, though."
1.0,up,I can't explain how great this movie is.

1.0,up,One of the best Pixar movies ever.
1.0,up,it was interesting and exiting
1.0,up,I did cry but an amazing film :)
1.0,up,"First scene get's me every time....I have much emotion invested in this film (Ellie represents all my could-have-beens and losses) so I may be a little bias, but brilliant telling for a brilliant story. Filmography couldn't have been more perfect. Provides a perfect place on Pixar's Shelf of Fame."
1.0,up,An incredible cinematic achievement. Stirring in ways that may go over the heads of its younger audience.

1.0,up,One of the best PG films ever made
1.0,up,very good movie I liked it.

1.0,ponyo,"Once again Miyazaki shows the world how to do animation. This simple innocent story looks stunning (esp in HD). It made me want to live in the town where it is set! In many ways this story feels similar in tone to Miyazaki's other work ""My Neighbour Totoro"" (16.12.10) (26.10.11) (19.10.12)"

1.0,ponyo,This was another classic in my eyes
1.0,ponyo,"Beautiful, imaginative and utterly adorable."

1.0,ponyo,"My 2-3 year old nephew gets so excited when he watches this film. He sits and is completely enraptured the entire time. There are very few films for which this is the case. Miyazaki creates magic, and this goes back to the roots he created with Totoro. A wonderful film."

1.0,ponyo,Miyazaki dose it again. Just amazing

1.0,ponyo,"The animation tops everything Disney has ever done and the story, while a little complicated for children to grasp the whole depth, just means as kids watch it over and over as they mature they will always learn something new from it. Young love is the strongest love of all."
1.0,ponyo,"Hayao Miyazaki does it again. Ponyo recaptures the same magic left off from Spirited Away. English voice casting helps enlighten some of the strong points of each of the characters in this, once again, fantastic animated movie."

1.0,ponyo,Loved it. My son too!!!

1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,"Amazing! Absolutely incredible script, execution and characters. Each with their own highly developed traits.

1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,"Wes Anderson's great direction mixed with surprisingly good animation with fantastic voice acting by the entire cast but mostly Clooney, Streep, and Schwartzman leads to, in my opinion, the BEST Roald Dahl based movie out there!"

1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,seems interesting especially with Wes Anderson directing.
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,This movie is Fantastic!!!!
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,"Introduced me to Wes Anderson, who is now a favorite filmmaker of mine. Such a good idea to let him loose on one of Roald Dahl's classic works"
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,"Just... wait for it.... Fantastic! The voice cast are all hilarious and great, the animation is very quirky and just lovely to behold, the music is good as expected from Anderson, and the tale is wonderfully adapted to fit the screen whilst never betraying it roots too much, wonderful!!"
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,"Wes Anderson's worst film, yet it still remains in my top 50. Wes Anderson could really abuse his usual artistic shots when using puppets, but there is something missing from this film, maybe it's the lack of the usual care Anderson puts into his characters. I still recommend it."
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,One of my favorite movies of all time! have watched it several times and pick up something clever each time.....
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,"Fantastic Mr. Fox is exactly that, Fantastic. There was not a moment when this movie was truly terrible. It's creative, it's witty and it's downright funny at times. They were also smart to keep Owen Wilson's part to a minimum."
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,Really fun and different.
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,"A great film to see, and one of Anderson's best. It has all of those quirky things you would expect from a film by Wes. It has a great story fun characters as well. Another plus for this film is the interesting art style that makes this film unique."
0.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,"I think I laughed twice. It strayed further from the story than Maddie from Portugal. 40 minutes felt like an hour and a half. it's dry, unfunny and boring. A wholly unnecessary and dreadful murder of a Roald Dahl classic."
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,"I saw this on tv the animation and story was very good, it was also slightly funny too"
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,Brilliant. Voice cast do an amazing job.
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,Very cute. I recommend this for families with young kids
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,Great movie. Such a great movie. It is so cute.
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,"out of all the movies i own and watch this has got to be the one in the Blu Ray player the most. Its witty, hilarious and random. Its a must see if you haven't seen it."
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,Don't cussing point at me!
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,I've seen this movie 3 times and luv it! Fell in luv wit kristofferson! Need someone like that haha jk
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,Fantastic! Wish there was a sequel
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,"Thought it would be too ""adult"" for the kids but they enjoyed it so much in their own way. I, on the other hand, was intrigued by Clooney and Streep's calming voices amidst such chaos, music of the 60s and the unexpectedly amazing animation (if this can even be called animation). Just excellent."
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,The script for this film is the best animated film script ever written
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,"Extraordinary, stop animation is perfect for Anderson's meticulous eye and it serves not only as a playful adaption of the children's book, but a commentary on society, and a tribute to the man Dahl himself. One of Anderson's best."
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,The best animated movie I have ever seen. Hilarious and brilliantly crafted. One of the few movies that deserves 5 stars
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,"hilarious, and gets funnier every time I watch it."
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,feel good movie of my life.

1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,the tone is important and Mr. Fox got it.
0.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,Really boring and filled with extremely ugly animation.Voice acting:CPlot:FEntertainment value:F!
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,I was pleasantly surprised by this film & my kids loved it. It's hard to believe its all animated & every little detail is amazing. George Clooney & Meryl Streep's voices just add to what is already a powerful storyline and a classic from Roald Dahl!
1.0,kung_fu_panda_3,This was a Nice movie to watch i watch about 2 times
1.0,kung_fu_panda_3,"Fun, fast moving, but still full of heart. The third installment in the KungFu Panda franchise is sure to please the younger audience, although adults might be surprised as well."
1.0,kung_fu_panda_3,This is the best animated series-xxxooo

1.0,kung_fu_panda_3,A great way to round off this amazing trilogy!
1.0,kung_fu_panda_3,"Oh my God, these films keep getting better and better, I loved it !!!"
1.0,kung_fu_panda_3,"Of all the Kung Fu Panda movies, this has probably the most predictable story, and In my opinion this might have more flaws than the first two (or at least little flaws) but I still love this film overall. Toy Story and Kung Fu Panda, my two favorite animated trilogies."
1.0,kung_fu_panda_3,"This third installment in the Kung Fu Panda series lives up to all of the things you want it to with beautiful animation, clever humor, and a couple underlying messages that more than just kids can appreciate."
0.0,kung_fu_panda_3,Fell asleep watching it. Oh well. Didn't miss much. Same bad guy shows up- Po feels inadequate. Trains some pandas. Figures out an obscure way to save the day at the last minute. Something like that.
1.0,kung_fu_panda_3,"Worth your time, any age."
1.0,kung_fu_panda_3,"Once again upping the animation and humor, Kung Fu Panda 3 breaks more ground with its father(s)/son angle while still delivering the spectacular visuals, entertaining characters, and emotional spirit that has come to be expected from such a franchise."
1.0,kung_fu_panda_3,I don't know if Kung Fu Panda 3 is the end of the series but if it is this would be a great ending to a great trilogy!
1.0,kung_fu_panda_3,"I have no idea how they make fun sequels, but obviously it can be done"
1.0,kung_fu_panda_3,Good meaning and story
1.0,kung_fu_panda_3,"This was the bomb ass movie, I love how it still brings the kung fu, with lots of love for family. Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman did an amazing job in this movie, I love it."

1.0,kung_fu_panda_3,Totally the best kung fu movie ever
0.0,kung_fu_panda_3,"The beginning and end is OK, but everything in the middle is just fill."
1.0,kung_fu_panda_3,Very awesome movie with a good plot and the villain was the best!
1.0,kung_fu_panda_3,"I enjoyed it more on 3D. It was worth the long wait since that teaser from Part 2. But this may well be the last one in the franchise, unless there is a far greater power than what Po had learned here."
1.0,kung_fu_panda_3,The final (?) act of KFP was the icing on the cake for this series. I don't know if they can top it.
1.0,kung_fu_panda_3,"As the 3rd film in series, this one recovers, and outdoes itself. Attempting to 'become a teacher', the panda must learn to teach his panda friends to fight an epic bad guy. Once again, CGI is great, the other characters get 10 lines of speech, and the action sequences are amazing! A- movie"
1.0,kung_fu_panda_3,Kung Fu Panda 3 is inspiring and awesome. All of the Kung Fu Panda movies have a story behind them which makes a great plot to each movie. I hope they make a Kung Fu Panda 4. I loved this movie. I would very much suggest this movie.

1.0,kung_fu_panda_3,"The second sequel of a Dreamworks franchise frankly has no business being this warm, engaging and resplendent. Kung Fu Panda 3 is a huge credit to the artists who made it -- it's the most beautiful animated film I've ever seen."

0.0,kung_fu_panda_3,All of the reviews for this movie are supposed good but the only good part of the movie was the end. The plot is stupid it's really slow I couldn't wait for it to be over it is and unnecessary sequel it's a money grab.

1.0,kung_fu_panda_3,Another great follow up.
1.0,kung_fu_panda_3,"Some of the jokes were sorta lame, but this animated flick was fun to watch, sad at times, and is overall a trilogy ending that is better than the original and the sequel."
1.0,kung_fu_panda_3,In this Kung Fu Panda film. The story follows Po into the world of Pandas. There's nothing bad to be said about this film. it was an amazing ride and the end of a excellent Trilogy.

0.0,sausage_party,"This is a typical Seth Rogan offering with shallow storyline, juvenile script and crude language. Whatever fun references might have improved it were completely overshadowed by the repetitive, immature crudity. Thick teenagers will love it."
0.0,sausage_party,This movie was awful. The jokes are absolutely terrible and are not funny in any way. This film should just disappear from The Cinematic Universe.

0.0,sausage_party,I expect this will be popular with frat boys and with girls desperate to date the frat boys and so will laugh and act like they're really enjoying this cinematic abomination.
0.0,sausage_party,"I think I was 20 minutes in and I didn't laugh once. If you expected cartoon characters swearing and making crude sexual references, you get that. If you expect jokes, you get none. It's as though they think the crudeness is the joke."

0.0,sausage_party,It's a pretty genius concept and the adult answer to Pixar is admirable and while I appreciate the attempt to add more meaning to the plot. This movie isn't too funny after the novelty of cursing groceries wears off.
0.0,sausage_party,This movie was so bad I couldn't make it through the whole thing. I do believe the producers of the garbage were hurting for money and decided to hoodwink as many of us into watching this for a quick payday.

0.0,sausage_party,"Tedious, boring, and what's worse, just not funny.It pathetically vacillated between gross out, shock comedy and limp philosophical, and it failed, painfully, cringe inducing at both. A travesty, a train-wreck, a debacle.There are no jokes just random swearing; It sucked."

1.0,sausage_party,"Amazing, hilarious, brilliant."
0.0,sausage_party,Profanity for the sake of profanity and bawdy jokes that lose their humor through repeated retellings help ensure that you won't relish Sausage Party.
0.0,sausage_party,"Disgustingly amateurish and takes one joke, a hot dog and buns, throughout the entire movie. Comes right out of the gate cussing up a storm. I think some juveniles made this movie and I feel dumber for watching it."

0.0,sausage_party,"literally the worst thing my eyes have ever witnessed on a tv screen. I can't believe someone got paid to write this garbage, dreamwork has (at times) serious talent in animation but they seem to be more interesting in churning out movies like this."
0.0,sausage_party,stupid liberal agenda.
1.0,sausage_party,It's really a 3 1/2 but I'm rating it a 5 to offset the overly sensitive snow flakes who get offended by everything. If you have a spine this is funny. If you get offended by words and have blue hair you will hate this movie

1.0,sausage_party,freakishly hilarious
0.0,sausage_party,"Absolute rubbish - rude, crude and vile language for no reason. Just a complete pile of cr@p. An adult cartoon doesn't require Fs, Cs etc but a clever plot, humour and a mature theme. Half a star as don't know how to do less."

0.0,sausage_party,"Absolute garbage. Nothing but profanity, crude sexual innuendo, and offensive racist humor. Liberal Hollywood degenerates made this movie, which is obviously appealing to children, to drag Western culture even further down into the gutter"
1.0,sausage_party,Ed Norton and Gum were my favourite
0.0,sausage_party,Didn't find it funny and doesn't need that much swearing within a film. Just ruin it.
0.0,sausage_party,"Sorry, rape isn't funny."
0.0,sausage_party,"Crude and unfunny. Most ""jokes"" are telegraphed food-based puns, innuendos, or idioms, which are then called out. For example: ""How do you like them apples?"" Nearby apples gasp. ""Not YOU apples!"""
0.0,sausage_party,A terrible movie that was written by a few morons that act 13 years old. Sounded like two 13 year olds. Who are drunk from drinking one of dad's beers. Arguing about who is the better WWF's!
0.0,sausage_party,Wish I could give it no stars. I thought we as a society were past these racially insensitive stereotypes.
0.0,sausage_party,What a load of absolute rubbish! Didn't laugh once throughout this film. The use of the C-bomb was just unnecessary and far too often to be honest. Not impressed at all

0.0,sausage_party,Disgustingly crude humor. Absolutely no reason to watch.

1.0,sausage_party,A dark comedy focusing on food coming alive and hoping to be bought by customers.. Little do they realize the horror that awaits them.
1.0,sausage_party,Absolutely hilarious and totally inappropriate. Loved it!
0.0,sausage_party,Tried way to hard to make it as raunchy and over the top as possible. Should have tried less. Terrible movie.
0.0,sausage_party,Without a doubt the most disgusting stupid filthiest piece of crap I have ever witnessed. Full of thinly veiled racism everywhere. Sexual deviency and depraved sexuality.
1.0,sausage_party,funniest fucking movie I've seen in a long time

0.0,sausage_party,"When it wasn't poking fun at stereotypes, it was just plain disturbing."
0.0,sausage_party,Sausage party is one of the worst films I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through. The only 'joke' in this movie is that the food swears constantly throughout. It feels like it was made by a bunch of immature 10 year olds.
1.0,sausage_party,"A surprisingly hilarious and sophisticated comedy with good creative writing, voice acting, and animation. A perfect example of a movie being mislead by its trailer."
1.0,sausage_party,One of the best movies of 2016
1.0,sausage_party,"the craziest, most hilarious and insane 18+ animation I have seen.So many good jokes and so many real life associations. I don't know what else to say! And the amount of cursing/bad words...off the fkn charts5/5 for it's originality"
0.0,sausage_party,it gets half star for the end scene. was so confused and freaked out how entertained I was. the rest of the movie was just not funny at all.

0.0,sausage_party,Couldn't get through it. Not funny. Not clever. Boring. Unwatchable garbage.
1.0,sausage_party,Very funny a bit offensive but still laughable
0.0,sausage_party,A truly dreadful movie. Assaults you with the same tired sex jokes just in case you didn't realise already about the obvious food euphemisms within the first thirty minutes and does not let up from there. The only thing to find offensive about this film is the total lack of talented writing. Avoid.
0.0,sausage_party,Most overrated movie of the year... a Hack joke tossed salad. Good original premise tho.

0.0,sausage_party,"This movie was nothing more than a sad pursuit to come out with an R rated animated movie.

0.0,sausage_party,What is this? Horrible writing and directing. The morons seem to think that squeezing curse words in every line and making sexual innuendos every minute make for a funny movie. I was over it after 5 minutes. Could have been a funny movie. They screwed it up. Nice one Seth.

1.0,sausage_party,How can you say no to Seth Rogan and his friends making food sex jokes. It's fantastic!
0.0,sausage_party,I'm a big fan of Seth Rogen James Franco etc. But this film was awful. Too much cussing and the end scene was so awful. I don't recommend this at all. Nothing like I thought it'd be.

0.0,sausage_party,Not funny -- just disappointing
0.0,sausage_party,it was an awful movie with an awful message and completely unfunny!
0.0,sausage_party,Straight up disgusting unnecessary propaganda for utter amorality.

0.0,sausage_party,"Very vulgar language, crude sexual content language! SICK, SICK, SICK... I try to have an open mind but this is too much!!"
1.0,sausage_party,Seth Rogen back at it again
0.0,sausage_party,a bit too vulgar even for me. Also noticed some.pretty obvious racist things.
0.0,sausage_party,Vulgarity is not comedy. I like adult humor. This was more like 12-year-old humor.

0.0,sausage_party,"Just a truly, truly, awful movie. Not funny, not clever, just pointlessly crass. Unwatchable."
0.0,sausage_party,"pointless, tired, redundant tropes/ jokes/ toilet humor gets old within the first 5 minutes of the film. I feel so sorry for the overworked and underpaid animators that had to work on this film. Too childish for adults, too raunchy for kids. This film is for no one."
1.0,sausage_party,"Hilarious, and so wrong. Probably the most I've laughed in years. But you can't be a wuss. Bagel an Lavash were hilarious. Saving Private Ryan sequence was amazing. sauerkraut that hates juice. Seth Rogan is still a douche, but he didn't get any money from me."

0.0,sausage_party,"Relies too much on shock value, after 10 min you get over the fact that a cartoon is X rated and then............nothing. Jokes a obvious, gross, and far and few between."
0.0,sausage_party,A puerile double entendre heavy 5 minutes stretched to a deadening movie. I think critics love it's no holds barred attack on religion. The characterisation and plot are rubbish compared to the average cgi family flick even.
0.0,sausage_party,The worst movie I have ever seen. Not funny or entertaining in any way.

1.0,sausage_party,Hilarious!! The last scene was a bit much though..
0.0,sausage_party,Not remotely funny. Stale jokes and sexual humor that was probably written by a 12-year-old.
0.0,sausage_party,"Entertaining for about 5 minutes. Beyond that, it's awful. I think the filmmakers were aiming for ""edgy"" and offensive, but the finished product was just crude, stupid, and unfunny."

1.0,sausage_party,"Superb...incredibly offensive and yet highly subversive on the most sensitive topic of all, Faith"

1.0,sausage_party,HILARIOUS. Not good viewing for anyone under 18.
1.0,sausage_party,I couldnt stop laughing!!
0.0,sausage_party,This would have probably been hilarious when I was 13-14...but I'm not. I had no real laugh out loud moments...kind of stupid.I love Seth Rogen and many of the voice actors - but this was not a funny movie.
0.0,sausage_party,The F word was used about a million times in the movie. And it got on my nerves for someone who loves to swear.
0.0,sausage_party,"A trash bag of a movie. Grotesque, weak humor, and overall sickening. Constantly sought after the shock factor. Don't waste your time."
0.0,sausage_party,If I could give it a zero I would. Lame. The best parts were in the commercial. His sense of humor is just stupid. I can't believe that a company would even waste money on this movie.
1.0,sausage_party,Oh my goodness.... I laughed so hard! Every second of this movie is completely inappropriate and adolescent - it's great.
1.0,sausage_party,This movie is totally and utterly hilarious!
0.0,sausage_party,We walked out. What junk
0.0,sausage_party,Initially funny and vulgar which can be a great combination but fizzles out after the first few minutes. This easily could have been a kids movie minus the dirty words and scene at the end. I can watch almost any movie but I was about snooze midway through this one.
1.0,sausage_party,"Totally not for kids but what a God Movie. I did not feel offended by it. Grose out, yep a bit. But that they oversexualiced food that way is good for my diet. Fantastic Movie. Too bad the general Public wont have the culture or setting of mind to really get it."

1.0,sausage_party,damn good fun; surprisingly good and filled with laughs
0.0,sausage_party,"Pretty heavy-handed anti-religion propaganda which wasn't very funny. All the writing and dialogue was on-the-nose and obvious. Too bad, it's a cool concept and I had high hopes for it."

1.0,sausage_party,"Wow, I mean I knew it wasn't a kid movie but wow I never thought it would go where it went."
1.0,sausage_party,The depth of jokes will surely go unnoticed by many. The jokes I noticed were so subtle and well educated in both culture and history that I can only wonder how much of this great comedy have I missed for lack of knowledge on history and international politics
0.0,sausage_party,Probably the worst movie I've seen in the past year. First movie I've ever wanted to walk out of the theatre on.
1.0,sausage_party,One of the funniest films I've seen in years.
1.0,sausage_party,This movie is really clever and seriously original. It is a deep social satire with a lot of great bawdy humor. It works at both levels. Works as stoner movie too.
1.0,sausage_party,Beautiful and nasty! I want to see it again!
0.0,sausage_party,It's okay- a couple of laugh out loud moments. It flirts with vulgarity but like it's statements on current affairs it's far to timid to pack any punch.
1.0,sausage_party,"Best movie of all time! Not only is it super funny, it even has a storyline and lots of suspense. I seriously didn't expect it to be this good, but it was! Super amazing!"
1.0,sausage_party,Super funny. Good work.
0.0,sausage_party,it sucked like it at first until it sucked the juice and then hated the rest too many bad words
0.0,sausage_party,Why do people find Seth Rogan funny?
1.0,sausage_party,Hilarious. Gets funnier as the movie goes on.
0.0,sausage_party,"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. Its like a bunch of 10 year olds got together and laughed about how they can swear on tv. Huge waste of time that I wish I could get back. Trailers are misleading, story is awful and the jokes are outdated and poorly executed."
0.0,sausage_party,"""Sausage Party"" is just a stupid idea. Ugly and drowned by unfunny sex and drugs jokes all the way. Unfortunately for Seth Rogen, this kind of film is not entertaining anymore."

1.0,moana_2016,Great Fun For The Whole Family!
1.0,moana_2016,For animation this is five stars for me. The singing wasn't over the top and it was a great story that flowed well throughout.

1.0,moana_2016,Best Disney movie since Toy Story 3. The only flaw is that it may have been hard for kids to follow. I absolutely loved it though.
1.0,moana_2016,Disney did it again. The new Frozen. Great movie for the whole family

1.0,moana_2016,Best since Lion King. I know a lot of people say that. But this time it's true
1.0,moana_2016,"Disneys take on the Samoan people when they weren't exploring. I looked it up, they are not Hawaiians.Songs are catchy and well written. New Disney princess is willful and independent, no romantic entanglements."
1.0,moana_2016,"There's something oddly satisfying about a Disney lead character that doesn't have a love interest or a parent that dies. Moana was a beautiful movie! Cute songs and happy feelings. The water animations were spot on, and the ocean spirit was adorable."
1.0,moana_2016,great animation could use abit less of singing but the your welcome and shiny songs were amazing story great johnson does a great job with his character and i think this has to be one of disney's best movies looking forward to cars 3

1.0,anomalisa,"BRILLIANT. it has fantastic animation, great themes, amazing storytelling and voice acting... every thing feels real in this movie. it's great."
0.0,anomalisa,"We found it slow although at times the animation was technically interesting. It might have been depressing if the characters and action weren't so dull and stereotypical. To tell the truth, we quit watching after about half an hour or so."
0.0,anomalisa,So boring it actually hurt to watch
1.0,anomalisa,You forget it's beautifully animated and you're swept up into the romance.
0.0,anomalisa,However artistic and different this movie was it was incredibly boring.
1.0,anomalisa,Emotionally intense and wonderfully internal.
0.0,anomalisa,"A stop motion film about the mundanity of a man's life, unsurprisingly perhaps it was quite mundane, 28 mins binned"
1.0,anomalisa,"Unique, vibrant and beautiful!"
0.0,anomalisa,I wanted to like this movie so much. But I hate it. I actively hate it.
1.0,anomalisa,Una maravilla visual.
0.0,anomalisa,really didn't get it - thought it was rubbish
1.0,anomalisa,"Wow. Weirdly enthralling, and completely remarkable."
1.0,anomalisa,"Intense, detailed, surreal, painfully real. What an amazing movie. You will watch and think about it for a long time, just to find out that's how life is."
1.0,anomalisa,"A ""heightened reality"" treat - amazing how entrancing it is to watch someone get out a cigarette, light one, take a puff, then put the box and lighter down on a table... when it's animated like this."
1.0,anomalisa,This is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen.
0.0,anomalisa,"I know all these artsy types love this but without drugs I have no idea what is going on. all this work on animation so weirdo Charley Kaufman can tell a story only a crazy person likes.why are the females have a male voice. stupid,#"
0.0,anomalisa,Absolutely horrible. Artsy crap. Don't bother.....you have warned.
1.0,anomalisa,"This is really a unique and fascinating film. There seems to be a deep message that is hard to comprehend; maybe that, for some people, familiarity breeds contempt."
0.0,anomalisa,So glad I didn't pay to see this in the theater. Sucked!
1.0,anomalisa,"Yet another look into Charlie Kaufman's brilliantly captivating mind. An absolutely stunning film, the best of the year."
0.0,anomalisa,What a bizarre movie to say the least about a guy who is struggling with life and his portrayal is played out in comic book form and the results are less appealing.
1.0,anomalisa,"Not long into the movie, we realize why it is better served in stop motion animation as opposed to real life. A fascinating depiction on (supposedly?) mid-life crisis, loneliness, and the illusion of love."
0.0,anomalisa,Don't waste your time. I kept waiting for something to happen and nothing did. Your own life is probably more interesting.
0.0,anomalisa,"Just horrible. Bad writing, bad animation. Wow...so bad."

0.0,anomalisa,"I HATED this movie. And I don't mean in a it was poorly made, was about nothing and was a waste of time sort of way - I mean in an every character disgusted me and I got physically angry while watching it sort of way. I HATED this movie."
1.0,anomalisa,"Excellent film that explores the dark parts of the human mind. I didn't know a movie with only 3 cast members could be so intriguing. Loved the comedic parts, and also liked the scenery I got lost in almost scene because it just looked so weirdly realistic."
0.0,anomalisa,Don't know what everyone loved about this movie. Was bored to death 50 minutes in.
1.0,anomalisa,"Surprisingly good, fresh, intelligent and brave."
0.0,anomalisa,"I feel like the director just wanted its viewer to be so consumed with the ""craft"" of the movie that coherence, plot or even an ending would just be forgotten entirely. It wasn't. Where is it?"
0.0,anomalisa,"Here is the plot of this movie: ""What if we set up what promises to be a very interesting plot, and then just completely drop it halfway through and make the rest of it as boring as humanly possible?"" That is the plot of this movie."
0.0,anomalisa,Like Catcher in the Rye for 50-year-olds.
0.0,anomalisa,"Ick. At somewhere around the 20 minute mark - I began to wonder - what the heck is this? I pause to go and watch the trailer, then it all became clear. You are either a fan of Charlie Kaufman or you are not. Not my cup of tea."
0.0,anomalisa,"If you like MFA graduate projects that are excellent in technical execution, but light on content, and high on audience suffering, this is the best movie of 2016."
0.0,anomalisa,Depressive anime of a burnt out individual. Don't waste your time.
1.0,anomalisa,"""Anomalisa"" is a brilliant animated feature from Charlie Kaufman, and one that I think deserves the recognition it gets. I don't necessarily think it's his best work, but it's still the work of a great talent."
0.0,anomalisa,"The movie was so boring that all the boring movies I've seen over the last yr. have just moved up on my list. I saw no ""great"" insight. I hope some other country that's into boring likes it enough to make their money back."
1.0,anomalisa,"This movie scared me more than any other horror movie in recent times. It felt like reality collapsing on itself, radically well done movie."
1.0,anomalisa,Linda animação e excelente direção de Kaufman.
1.0,anomalisa,"Hermosa, relajada, brillante película que esconde una verdad para nuestra realidad, dentro de un mundo maduro y similar."
0.0,anomalisa,"It's quite uncomfortable to watch this. Overall just a strange, strange movie."
0.0,anomalisa,"Projecting your emotionally crippled baggage onto others under the guise of looking for a connection. So your basic misanthropic Charlie Kaufman shtick, but with puppets. I wish it'd been visually more impressive but frankly there's no reason this couldn't have been live action."
0.0,anomalisa,"This is stop-motion animated shit. The most uncomfortable, slow moving, painful, shit."
0.0,anomalisa,"A chasmously bad movie. A movie so bad that light cannot escape it. The puppetry is not done well enough to even be an entertaining gimmick, much less help to tell this garbled, self-indulgent version of a story. A big, stinky, hairy turd. Avoid at all costs."
0.0,anomalisa,"Depressing. Self-pity party with run-on plot. After the novelty of animation wears off, weird in a bad way."
1.0,anomalisa,Quietly melancholic and thought-provoking. Kaufman's film delves deep in to our minds to explore our perceptions of human interaction.
0.0,anomalisa,Worse film ever I almost left 15 minutes in and only stayed for the sex scene which was not as good as the scene in team America but amazing for the wrong cringe reasons.
0.0,anomalisa,"Bleak, boring, and pointless. The main character is really not even likeable, so it's difficult to see why the audience should really care what happens to him."
0.0,anomalisa,The most vulgar and pointless film ever. It should be rated X
0.0,anomalisa,Adolescent angst passing itself off as art. Pitiful.
0.0,anomalisa,"What weird movie is this? Profanity from beginning to end... Super slow movie and and the characters voices are men, including the women. Don't know how this garbage got good reviews."
0.0,anomalisa,"Dull, pedestrian, and a complete wate of my time and money. I feel bad for people who get persuaded by ""artistic"" hype that this movie represents anything really meaningful. Go see any other movie."
1.0,anomalisa,Grade: A+Rating: 10/10
1.0,anomalisa,Charlie Kaufman does it again. Go see it.
1.0,anomalisa,"Captivating, but I have no idea why. Maybe, it's the self enclosed universe that is entirely mundane but real, hyper-real even & yet because its animated, anything could happen to this simple world. You're waiting for maybe a dragon to rip down the hotel and incinerate the lot of them."
0.0,anomalisa,"dreadfully slow, boring with the occasional (totally unfunny) slapstick humour."
1.0,anomalisa,This is the first time in 2 years that I'm giving a perfect score. Preferably 10/10!
0.0,anomalisa,Love everything Kaufman has ever done...until now. boring gives way to pointless. The puppets are cool though...for about the first 20 minutes.
1.0,anomalisa,"Anomalisa is a very good movie, the first time I saw I was surprised by how realistic it was although being an animated film, it captures it's idea in a very amazing way."
0.0,anomalisa,Worst movie I have ever seen
0.0,anomalisa,"Weird pointless movie. If you'd like to feel depressed, go see this one."
0.0,anomalisa,"The ultimate ""what the F did I just watch?"" movie. I literally sat there waiting for it to get better, and it felt like it was going to, and then it didn't ... and then it did, and didn't again... and then it ended. Whoever made this should be banned from ever making a movie again. Ever."

0.0,anomalisa,I was incredibly bored.
1.0,anomalisa,"Like many others, I've seen most of the ""must-see"" films this year and none of them stuck with me quite like this. If you pay attention, you will walk away a better person. It has already impacted the way I think and act on a daily basis."
0.0,anomalisa,"beautiful visuals but such a weak story and character development. why all the hard work on animation. why the critical interpretations? this is so bad. why bother?!! can't believe movie ""critics"" give any serious attention to this sad effort."
0.0,anomalisa,very disappointing movie experience. such a weak story. such a tired story premise and thin characters to not care about. all this art and craft with so little effect.
1.0,anomalisa,Delightfully strange film with superb technical animation and sharply humorous script and story
1.0,anomalisa,"""The most human film of the year!""Critics were right! This film was amazing!"
0.0,anomalisa,I don't get it. It's not a look at loneliness; its a look at a sad old man who can't connect with people unless he's drunk. The connection ends when he sobers up. That's it.
0.0,anomalisa,"Do yourself a favor and save the money - this is the worst movie of the year. I'm still waiting for it to start. The production values are poor, the dialogue pointless at best (cringe-inducing at worst), and the story is nonexistent. What a waste of time."
0.0,anomalisa,"Went to see this with a bunch of people who like Indi and experimental film - everyone hated it. At best, it's an interesting entry level student film project. At worst, a self indulgent sophomoric trash."
0.0,anomalisa,A meandering story with usual Kaufman weirdness that isn't reigned in and goes nowhere.
0.0,anomalisa,Terrible movie. Poor Story. It's a cartoon!!!
1.0,anomalisa,One of the best animated films I've ever seen.
0.0,anomalisa,"This is the weirdest movie I've ever seen. It ended too abruptly. It could have been more meaningful. No passion, very guarded, ideas and feelings poorly articulated. I liked the uniqueness of the animation but the dialogue (and the movie in general) was just sort of empty."
0.0,anomalisa,"pretty poor movie,its funny listerning to a English accent which is not an real English accent,i was surprised it ot good reviews,animated movie i would give this movie a miss"
0.0,anomalisa,"Thought this movie was going to make me feel, but felt nothing other than disappointment. Couldn't relate to Michael and there was no point to his sad acts of desperation."
0.0,anomalisa,The critiques were misleading. Ready to walk out after few minutes. Would give 0 stars.
1.0,anomalisa,Beautifully animated with such realistic detail and design. This film is quite a dive into the world of a fractured mind.
0.0,anomalisa,"I was very optimistic with the hype etched in reviews,but it was a pointless waste of a couple of hours. A mediocre story, played out in thousands of Holiday Inns on business conferences coast to coast. Disappointing ending , naturally."
1.0,anomalisa,"A beautiful and haunting masterpiece, no question about it"
1.0,anomalisa,"Congratulations to Charlie Kaufman for making the most awkward, beautiful movie of the year."
1.0,anomalisa,"Wow, this is a masterpiece. It is a beautiful film that takes an unexpected turn to examine the emptiness of the human soul."
1.0,anomalisa,"Amazing concept, script, dialogue...and the technology is mind-blowing."
0.0,anomalisa,"Don't believe, this is boring and pointless. We all stood in the lobby after the so called film and looked questioningly at each other."
1.0,anomalisa,"The animation is unlike any I have ever seen. The story is simple and profoundly human, highlighting some of our greatest fears. Charlie Kaufman strikes gold and continues to grow as an artist."
1.0,anomalisa,"Exceptional, extraordinary and exquisitely played. This little work of genius won't be too everyone's tastes but if you connect with it you'll experience cinema at its most challenging. Brilliantly written and wonderfully paced this sad, slow elegy on alienation will echo long in the memory."
0.0,anomalisa,"boring, boring, boring and obvious"
0.0,anomalisa,Had high hopes but just a terrible movie. Save your cash.
1.0,anomalisa,"A stop motion masterpiece, bitch slaps you in the feelings, and fuck with your head and heart"
1.0,anomalisa,"never seen anything quite like it. so incredibly aware of the human condition, using puppets who are so much more human than the rest of us. just fkn amazing in every way. tomorrow i will have to analyze it in more depth."
0.0,anomalisa,Visually appealing. That's all. It's getting better ratings based on hype. The story is weak.
1.0,anomalisa,"A very sad, heartbreaking, funny and sweet film about what it means to be human. And what it means to have a deep connection we all seem to be looking for."
0.0,anomalisa,Depressing and pointless.
0.0,anomalisa,One of the most boring movies I've ever seen awful!!!
0.0,anomalisa,Michael's life is too dark. There's no background to tell us where he's coming from and the plot provides no hope. It's a snapshot of someone in a very ugly place. Maybe it needs a sequel to show some context - or maybe Michael's just a doll.
0.0,anomalisa,"This movie was slow, sad, and painful. It is about a clay puppet with narcissism and depression issues.Strongly recommend you see something else."
0.0,anomalisa,This movie is horrible... IDK how you can give it a 92 on rotten tomatoes... nothing is great and or intriguing in this movie. love kaufman but cmon; know you ll all up on his balls. makes no sense why you would give this steam pile a good rating. such a bad review...
1.0,anomalisa,"This is the animated film that should win the Oscar for Best Animated feature, but it won't because no one will vote for a movie with animated oral sex, although the movie is about searching for a unique connection in a sea of homogeny."
0.0,anomalisa,"If you want to spend 90 minutes inside the head of another self-absorbed privileged older white guy who treats people terribly, this is the movie for you. It did lead to some interesting discussion, such as ""is Claymation pornography a thing?"" Overall, though, it was a zoo-sized mess of a movie."
0.0,anomalisa,"I don't know why this movie is rated so highly. I found it boring, slow and unnecessarily sexual. I'm far from being a prig, but when a a big part of the premise is an older married man picking up a younger naive girl and having explicit sex with her, I find it rather disgusting. I had to walk out."
1.0,anomalisa,Is there anything that Charlie Kaufman can't do?
0.0,anomalisa,"Not my cup of tea. Almost walked out of theater. Life sucks; everyone is in a monotone voice...nothing to be grateful for......Anomolisa the only voice that has any meaning? Felt sorry for lisa and despised maleu ""protagonist."""
1.0,anomalisa,A beguiling dreamscape that also happens to be one of the year's most beautifully constructed and photographed films. Kaufman is a singular artist with a finger on the pulse of the modern human psyche.
1.0,anomalisa,"Creepy, sad, and excellent. The first 30minutes are difficult to get through but it gets better. First half for critics second half for normal people. It ends up becoming a masterpiece after all."
1.0,anomalisa,"Best movie of the year, possibly last 5 years."
0.0,anomalisa,"This movie is terrible and depressing. The one star is for the technical expertise in the visuals. The main character preys on women, has no redeeming qualities. The story is boring and incoherent."
1.0,anomalisa,It is a great movie! as every other of David's stories he explores human basic emotions in a very unique way. Amazing
1.0,anomalisa,"Anomalisa [Kaufman, 2015] a meditation on one's longing to detach from societal patterns in a fascinatingly anomalous piece of art. 10/10"
0.0,anomalisa,"so much work by so many, filming a great stop action film with such a boring and needlessly sexual plot with a main character full of personal issues. waste of time"
1.0,anomalisa,Charlie Kaufman is easily one of my favorite film makers. So brilliant. So subtle. So honest.
0.0,anomalisa,I guess I had higher expectations than this movie delivered. I kept waiting for an uplifting moment and that moment never came. It was overall depressing.
1.0,anomalisa,woah. that was amazing!
0.0,anomalisa,If it was possible to give this negative stars I would have given them. This was a horrible film that was NOT important. It was just plain awful. I'm sorry I wasted time on this.
1.0,anomalisa,"This film may not appeal to many, but it truly is for everyone. You may not like it to begin or even get it but it is a cinematic masterpiece because it shows you how many humans if not all, think. It is a must watch for all."
0.0,anomalisa,Not only was the preview deceiving but so are the reviews. Beautiful human emotion is not watching a middle age man trying to get laid while at a hotel away from his family.
0.0,anomalisa,I usually like Charlie Kaufman's stuff but this was pretty unbearable to watch.
1.0,anomalisa,"This movie is simply incredible. Great story, great effects... the way movies should be like, full of heart and love for the characters. Wow!"
0.0,anomalisa,"I didn't get, I didn't enjoy it. Seemed pointless."
1.0,anomalisa,"Few films have managed to capture raw emotional honesty the way the puppets in this film do. Thought provoking, surreal, tragic, mesmerizing, and beautiful are only a few words that begin to describe this uniquely profound and brilliant film."
1.0,anomalisa,So incredibly beautiful
1.0,anomalisa,"The latest of Mr. Kaufman's ingenious, idiosyncratic achievements is a challenging stop-motion delight about the pleasure and pain of human connection."
0.0,anomalisa,"If anyone wants to watch puppets master bate, watch this"
0.0,anomalisa,"I was waiting for the movie do the hype. What a let down.The animation reminded me of the 1960's Davey and Goliath, Movie was depressing and made light of mental illness."

1.0,anomalisa,"So glad Kaufman is back. Another reviewer called the film ""Chekhovian"" and I absolutely agree."
1.0,anomalisa,"Exquisite masterpiece, respecting the spirit and story of George Lucas. Expected nothing less from J.J. Abrams"
0.0,anomalisa,"Boring, depressing, excruciating."
1.0,anomalisa,"An incredibly touching, funny and sweet movie. One of the most ambitious animated movie in the last few years and, ironically, one of the most human movies i have seen in a long time."
1.0,anomalisa,"At first viewing you'd think why would anyone make an adult animated film, but, after the film was over it still stayed with me long after I finished watching it. It's a film that grows on you. Very thoughtful and imaginative."
1.0,anomalisa,One of my favourite movies of the year.
0.0,anomalisa,"Mundane. Monotonous. A crowd sourced movie that was two years in the making, that could have been shot in 1 week in live action (that is an actual quote from the filmmakers)."
1.0,anomalisa,"Anomalisa marks another brilliant and utterly distinctive highlight in Charlie Kaufman's filmography, and a thought-provoking treat for fans of introspective cinema. . ."

0.0,anomalisa,Boring ! Boring and Boring.
1.0,anomalisa,"Quite honestly, my favorite film of the year."
1.0,anomalisa,"In a profoundly sad and beautiful film, it's unsettling how real and human it is despite the nature of its making."
1.0,anomalisa,One of the best movies this year.
1.0,anomalisa,Stuck with me. Dreamscape. Haunting screenplay. All masterfully calculated. Uncomfortable. Perfect in all details.
1.0,anomalisa,"A stunning visual film that deals with human emotions, and succeeding only using puppets; a goal only Kaufman could achieve."
1.0,anomalisa,Simply a masterpiece!
1.0,anomalisa,Only word to describe any Charlie Kaufman film: Singular. Fucking A.
0.0,kung_fu_panda,So I saw part of it and it was not entertaining and I didn't really consider it a martial arts movie which I figured it wouldn't be so I'm not for this movie

1.0,kung_fu_panda,wow wow wow. This is a genius. It's a KUNG FU PANDA. A KUNG FU PANDA. Who doesn't like Kung? Who doesn't like fu? Who doesn't like pandas? If you're 5 you can watch this if your 90 you can watch this; 11/10. Would watch on 20-hour loop.

1.0,tarzan,turk and tarzan are my favorite characters
1.0,tarzan,"How do you fuck up a Disney Renaissance movie with a soundtrack done by Phil Collins? You can't; it's impossible. A wonderful movie from beginning to end in every aspect.

1.0,bolt,i love bolt if i could i would watch it every day
0.0,bolt,"Overshown, Overglorified, Over Rated, Avoid At All Costs"

0.0,bolt,It's cute but it's definently for the little kids.
1.0,bolt,"This movie is amazing, adorable, and makes me cry every time. EVERY."
1.0,bolt,It's not from Pixar? Could've fooled me. I'm wiling to say this one is that good--goes from comedy in the first act to shockingly emotional material in the second. Brilliant film.
1.0,bolt,"Bolt offered something bold and edgy to the table without making something so absurd and out of place that it just doesn't work. As a result, the provocative 2008 film managed to become Disney's rightfully deserved comeback hit."
0.0,bolt,"One of the worst Disney animated movies of all time. Worse than Pocahontas, though better than The Many Adventures Of Winnie The Pooh. Aside from that, it's boring, stupid, obnoxious and down right irritating. There is simply no real plot."

0.0,finding_dory,A sequal that no one asked for and only did as well as it did thanks in part to 90's kids. Dory is nothing special or ground breaking story or animation wise and doesn't deserve the amount of money it's pulled in nor the acaim it recived.

1.0,fantasia,Incredible animation/visuals
1.0,fantasia,"Fantasia is always forgotten. When people do remember it, they never have anything to say about it. This film is full of probably Disney's best hand-drawn animation all played out to history's best music. This film could be timeless if people would just give it a chance."

1.0,fantasia,really enjoyed this film
1.0,fantasia,Best Animated Feature of All Time.

1.0,fantasia,"Even at 71-years-old, Fantasia is a unique artistic experience that has yet to be properly duplicated. Walt Disney's one time failure has proven to be one of his biggest successes."

1.0,fantasia,The most memorable Disney classic in adaption to the classical music pieces ever composed by the world's famous composers.
1.0,fantasia,"Most likelly one of the best Disney have made, wich isnt trivial. So much feeling its given into this, like music the animation its there to be enjoyed and interpreted by each like a mini master work"
1.0,fantasia,All the music for films is on it.

0.0,fantasia,"Not a fan. I dont see how its a good movie to watch. I dont know of any person who would even consciously say, hey you know what i havent seen in a while? Fantasia, lets do that to ourselves. Never. Blarghaflargh"
1.0,fantasia,I personally loved this film. I don't think you will enjoy on bit of it if you don't like artwork or music. I loved how they associated the film/ artwork in the same rythym with the music being played. It really bridged the gap between art and music.
1.0,fantasia,Chernabog (Satan) is the most compelling character of the entire film.
1.0,fantasia,Great visuals and Music 5 out of 5
1.0,fantasia,"I really liked this movie, because it is just great and soothing to listen to like it will always but you in a good mood. Also the colors and pictures are very cool too! They use classical music for this movie, like Bach. The first song they play gets kind of aggressive then goes soft."
1.0,fantasia,"Fantasia may not have any dialogue, but I have a feeling that that is what makes it great. The animation is over its head for the 1940s, and the music that accompanies the sequences is charming. This one is still perfect in my book."
1.0,fantasia,Stands on its own as a grand masterpiece. Still amazing.
0.0,fantasia,I extremely disliked this movie. The no talking was very boring and i was tired of the movie ten minutes after it started and then it was two hours long!

1.0,fantasia,Et la magie opÃ¨re dans ce long-mÃ (C)trage d'animation signÃ (C) Disney. Le 3Ã¨me du genre et le premier alliant si bien musique classique et narration.
1.0,fantasia,A true masterpiece in both the fields of music and animation. Definitely one of Disney's finest.
1.0,fantasia,A great mix of animation (traditional and from several different artists of the time) and classic music. An oddly inspiring piece of work that incorporates beauty and wonder.
1.0,fantasia,"This is, by far, one of Disney's best films of all time."
1.0,fantasia,"It's been said that Fantasia isn't as good for kids as much as it is for adults and nerdy kids. It's defiantly an acquired taste but never the less Fantasia is beautifully made movie with a unique strategy of storytelling, and in my opinion it is the best Disney movie ever made."
1.0,fantasia,This is the closest thing I've seen Disney do that transcends animation into the realm of art. It's real food for the soul stuff. And all of its small failures seem only to add shading and depth to the over all exquisiteness of the film.
1.0,fantasia,The best animated musical ever.
1.0,fantasia,Best Film when I was a child. This is just amazing
1.0,fantasia,music with visual effects in perfect harmony
1.0,fantasia,"An original, inventive, imaginative and creative experience that, found in only a handful of films, allows audiences to create their own interpretations of the images on screen and turn them into meaning. Beautiful, colourful and brilliant, its one of the first exercises in excess movies released."
1.0,fantasia,"Disney's best. It surprises me why films like 2001 and Fantasia (films with little dialogue) aren't common. I know audience have come to except speech in film, but the music gets by so much more and is fantastic."
1.0,fantasia,Ok...we need it with a new full digital recording.We also need another Fantasia in full 3d
1.0,fantasia,"A beautiful, colorful, animated movie with lovely music and excellent animation. 5 out of 5."

1.0,fantasia,"Definitely my favorite movie next to The Wizard of Oz, Fantasia has the sound and picture that captures audiences of all ages. With music pieces like The Sorcerer's Apprentice, The Dance of the Hours, and Ave Maria, this film is indeed one of Disney's best motion pictures if not the best."
1.0,fantasia,Arguably the best animated film of the 20th century.  Rating: Full Price

1.0,princess_mononoke_1999,Breathtaking and intoxicating; Princess Mononoke is one of Miyazaki's best - if not best - films in my opinion. Every second of this film is beautiful and tragic. As dark as Miyazaki can get with his concepts - this is by far the most adult-oriented of his works I can recall offhand.
1.0,princess_mononoke_1999,"Beautiful, heartfelt and truly amazing! From one of my favorite directors of all-time, Hayao Miyazaki!"
1.0,princess_mononoke_1999,"One of the finest achievements in animation, so pure, greater than life characters and action, killing soundtrack and plot. My favourite film of miyasaki-san."

1.0,princess_mononoke_1999,"Miyazaki's greatest feat. This movie is far more life-like than most, exploring every nook and cranny of the human mind in regards to love, good and evil, and nature itself. Redefining what a ""kids movie"" can be; and should be."

1.0,princess_mononoke_1999,"Personally, my favourite fantasy film to come out of the anime works.

From characters, to story, to action, to animation, to love, it nails it on all points."

1.0,princess_mononoke_1999,"One of my favorite movies of all time. The characters and their relationships were deep and meaningful,and all the while the relationships between animals never felt less real than reality does itself. All and all, the movie is a pinnacle of story telling and drama of the animation world."
1.0,princess_mononoke_1999,"Princess Mononoke is a classical film, not to mention the hard-boiled action and stuff. Hayao Miyazaki scores another home run for Japan and his studio, Ghibli. but since it has blood and gore, it can be a little attentive to children below 13 years old. but for me, this movie is five-star woop!"
1.0,princess_mononoke_1999,"Easily one of the best animated films. Miyazaki's strange stories and creatures mix with an important message that an environmentalist, like myself, can simply adore."

1.0,bambi,i like it and love it ... it's soo pure and uniqe
0.0,bambi,This is one of the few classic Disney movies I find bone-gnawingly boring. Even as a kid I would have gladly taken Bambi's mom's place to get out of seeing this movie to its finish.
0.0,frankenweenie_2012,"Definitely a low point in the long list of films brought to you by Disney. Tim Burton does not know how to appeal to a younger audience, as shown also in his remake of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Very poor."
1.0,frankenweenie_2012,"With great visuals, excellent animation and 3D, chilling scares, an enjoyable story-line, and some great voice acting, ""Frankenweenie"" is a perfect film to check out for the Halloween season, and stands as Tim Burton's best film in the past few years."
0.0,frankenweenie_2012,"The first 30 mins of the film are great, since the minute 31, the hole movie goes downhill. With unnecessary characters, a dumb end and one of the worst third act i never seen."

0.0,frankenweenie_2012,"Don't get me started on this movie. I thought it would be good but it was horrible, black and white were the only colours that they used. The voices are horrible and the story line sucks... I just can't believe that I spent 20$ on this movie!"
1.0,frankenweenie_2012,"Will still be as good 100 years from now whereas movies like ""Despicable Me"" (which is good, too, but not in the same way) won't."

0.0,frankenweenie_2012,"Ew.. I cannot believe I just wasted my time with this... What's the use of IMAX 3D, if everything is in black and white.. This was just a waste of time, I don't recommend it.. One bit!"

1.0,frankenweenie_2012,"For this film, I believe Tim Burton has really outdone himself. The twists in the plot, the brilliant actors, the movie itself is incredible. I'd like to lose half a star just because of one of the characters, but I would never do that to FRANKENWEENIE."

Ironic much?

0.0,james_and_the_giant_peach,The tone of this movie strays too far from the book and just gets creepy
1.0,james_and_the_giant_peach,"Very innovative cinematic experience. Reminds me of the good things in childhood, the sense of wonderment and zeal for exploration.

0.0,james_and_the_giant_peach,"Roald Dahl's novel was bad enough, but this movie adaptation is far beyond abysmal. And here are the reasons why; bad scripting, terrible acting, a poor storyline (well, some bits may be high) and a man-eating rhino from the sky. Seriously?

1.0,only_yesterday_1991,One of my favorite studio Ghibli works. I think it's about how you never really stop comming of age. True to life in my opinion
1.0,only_yesterday_1991,It's a movie about one looking back at the past. It's fairly slow moving but it was handled classily.
1.0,only_yesterday_1991,"One of Ghibli's quietest, but also most emotionally resonant films. In my personal opinion this is the studio's best work. It uses animation to do things not possible in live action cinema, but in ways hardly ever seen before or since."
1.0,only_yesterday_1991,My favorite Studio Ghibli movie.
1.0,only_yesterday_1991,"This is one of my favorite Studio Ghibli films. Very Japanese, very heartwarming. Tip: watch it in Japanese with subtitles if at all possible."
1.0,only_yesterday_1991,"My favourite animated movie. You forget that it is an animated film because the storyline is so good. It could apply to both you and me, anywhere at anytime."
1.0,only_yesterday_1991,"Takes a bit of getting into, but is packed with scenes that live on in the memory"
1.0,only_yesterday_1991,"An animated chick flick? I didn't think I'd like this film, but by the end its simple beauty left me in tears. A quiet, understated story about a woman looking back on her life and the choices that led her to where she is today."
1.0,only_yesterday_1991,An enjoyable movie that's very hard not to enjoy. Watch it.
1.0,only_yesterday_1991,This movie is astounding. Isao Takahata is a genius. Sit back and let it wash over you. Everybody should see this film.
1.0,only_yesterday_1991,"Want to see what Japanese school life is about? although anime, it makes your emotions and feelings flourish. Very nice story."
1.0,only_yesterday_1991,"Probably my favourite movie from Ghibli studios. I think it's simple style, it's simple story, makes it very real and very deep into the girl's heart. It also shows bits of Japan history and modern transition. Beautiful movie."
1.0,only_yesterday_1991,"I've never before seen a film I loved in quite this way, and I never saw an animated film that achieved such an intimate and deep personal resonance with me. It's a pure emotional high, and you don't come down once the experience is over; you take it with you. And it's just so beautiful to look at."
1.0,only_yesterday_1991,My favourite ghibli movie. Just wonderful illustration of Japanese country life.
1.0,only_yesterday_1991,Has a contemplative ease about it. A special film.
1.0,only_yesterday_1991,"Beautiful, charming, enlightening. All these words can be used to describe this film. This is just one incredible piece of art, with a story that is so not incredible that it's a great gasp of fresh air. A must-see."
1.0,only_yesterday_1991,"Miyazaki explores the life of a young woman searching her soul by making her 5th grade life and the present parallel. In the end, she found her soulmate."
1.0,only_yesterday_1991,"Another brilliant animated film, with so many layers of depth its like a frickin archeological dig."
1.0,only_yesterday_1991,"this is definitely one of my favorite miyazaki films. The story is so relatable and heartfelt. Makes you smile wistfully at some parts, and laugh in others. Incredible, simple, sincere, and beautiful film."
1.0,only_yesterday_1991,"Unfortunately, I've only seen this film once, but I completely fell in love with it. The characters are so relatable. Another great work from Studio Ghibli..."
1.0,only_yesterday_1991,"One of the most mature,insightful,andheartfelt animated films ever,if you have not experienced this phenomenally told stories, i suggest you do very soon."
1.0,only_yesterday_1991,"This is a wonderfully imagined film, and an under-appreciated classic."
1.0,only_yesterday_1991,A film that defies everything everyone expects from animation in subtle and brillant ways. Isao Takahata is a genius and this is his strongest work. I cannot recommend this underrated gem any more.
1.0,only_yesterday_1991,Studio Ghibli as written by Kazuo Ishiguro. Very sweet.
1.0,only_yesterday_1991,"Studio Ghibli does it again; this time not a fantasy, but a look back at a life lived and unlived."

1.0,mulan,One of my favorite Disney movies.
1.0,mulan,Such an inspirational movie. Mulan will do anything to protect her father and country! And Reflection was the first song I ever performed!
1.0,mulan,This movie brings honor to all Disney movies
1.0,mulan,"This is an ultimate masterpiece from Disney, by far. Songs such as ""Reflection"", ""I'll Make a Man Out of You"", and ""Honor to Us All"" make the film's story more fast-paced, and the powerful emotions of the characters are striking and grasping. Mushu is also one of Disney's best sidekicks."
1.0,mulan,"Hands down the best Disney animated film ever. The themes that run through the movie e.g. family/self pride, gender discrimination, cultural norms, superstition make this film an atypical and endearing classic for the whole family."
1.0,mulan,i love how they don't even have the right trailer...
1.0,mulan,"Mulan has memorable characters and better morals than most princess films. Plus, I'll Make A Man Out of You"" is one of the best Disney songs, period."
1.0,mulan,"It's Disney at its best, need I say more?"
1.0,mulan,Great movie awesome story wonder why Disney don't make great cartoon movies like this anymore love it
1.0,mulan,Honorable and enthralling with comedy used sparingly.
1.0,mulan,"Probably a 4 star film but the music brings it up. ""Man Out of You is"", in my opinion, the greatest of Disney Songs (just edging out Scar's song ""Be Prepared"")."

1.0,mulan,"Possibly, for me, this is the best Disney movie. Has good themes and tone and message not to mention animation."

1.0,mulan,"My favorite Disney Movie, yet!"
1.0,mulan,"No matter how many times I watch it, I am still in love with this one!"
1.0,mulan,"""Mulan"" is not a perfect Disney film, but it's a great one. A load of fun with stellar animation and awesome songs, Mulan is probably one of the strongest female characters in the Disney canon, up there with the likes of Belle and the fairies from ""Sleeping Beauty."""

1.0,tokyo_godfathers,"One of the best Christmas films out there, and it's Japanese! Satoshi Kon takes three characters that you probably wouldn't normally like and shows you a side to them that you wouldn't expect. I love this film to bits. Now, Sony, where's that English dub version?"
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,"it was wonderful and so much fun to watch this. i loved the ex-drug queen, hana, she's such a character you can't help loving!!Satoshi Kon is amazing at bringing out inevitable humane quality, so much drama and so much hope are in it."

1.0,tokyo_godfathers,Satoshi Kon stuff is just so Japanese that it's really pointless to dubb it into english. He's got this certain style that is so unique! The fantasy world crossing over to the real world. It's fun to watch.

0.0,tokyo_godfathers,I was digging this film until it turned into a really dumb action film. I felt cheated and turned it off.
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,Very beautiful story line
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,Fantastic Christmas movie for sentimental suckers who try not to be.
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,"Beautiful story about a ""family"" of homeless people trying to find the parents of an abandoned baby on X-mass eve. This film touches on very sensitive subjects such as homelessness, homosexuality, and unwanted children. Amazing and tragic as well as funny. One of the best anime of all time."
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,"A wonderfully fulfilling story with twists and turns leading you on the adventure which will make you laugh, wince, and if you can admit it - shed a tear. A completely satisfying experience with a need to re-watch becoming instantly evident as soon as the credits roll! Just watch it!"
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,Great story and visuals.
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,I wouldn't expect anything less from the visionary genius of Satoshi Kon. Paprika and Tokyo Godfathers go beyond all the limits of anime.
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,"I really loved this movie. I first saw at the world premier, I was one of the first 400 or so to see it.Each time you watch it you find something that you've missed the previous times you've watched it. I would say that this is my most favorite full-length anime movie of all time."
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,Good storyline~ touching animation.
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,"Should have been corny, but was a superbly executed story of human strength, perseverance, and family."
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,"One of the funniest and most poignant movies out there. A series of coincedences that generally makes the world a better place. Sounds corny, but the writing and the direction of this movie make it work to such a degree, that it's really perfection..."
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,There's something really wrong with you if you don't like this one.
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,"Its hard not to go over the top with praise for this movie. The human elements portrayed were so well observed that it convinced a racist family member that Japanese people ""Really are quite a lot like us"" For me there can be no higher praise."
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,"Totally brilliant film, loved it to bits."
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,"being a class a1 grinch i avoided this movie like the plague. i gave it a go on the basis of satoshi kon's other ripper 'memories'. 'tokyo godfathers' proves without doubt kon's masterful storytelling and sublime compositional talents. if you like this, 'paranoia agent' will blow you away."
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,"If hollywood would've done this movie, live action, it would've been stupid. . .but with Satoshi Kon directing, it's just right. . .and being animated just adds that much more to it (especially since this isn't the sort of thing you'd expect to be animated)."
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,"This is a near perfect film. Seriously. It's funny, touching, creates powerful and compelling characters. It's excellently voice acted and completely perfectly written. I am very hard on film writers, being a theatre writer, and this is writing perfection."
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,"This movie is so near and dear to my heart. Every single character in this film (both major and minor) is so well written. My favorite character has to be Hana though. Eventhough s/he starts out as a comic character, the movie really is about her quest to be a mother."
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,"WOW!! this is a must, the sypnosis speaks for itself, read it and rent this awesome anime!!!"
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,"I am stingy as hell when it comes to giving stars for movies.  This one, however, blew me away. I didn't want it to end!"
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,This was an amazing and touching film. I saw this on a flight to London a few years ago and I loved it. I went mad trying to find it on dvd. The characters work so well together.
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,Probably my favorite film from Satoshi Kon.
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,LOOOOOVE IT! So sweet. :D

1.0,tokyo_godfathers,Such A sweet Film! Seriously No-one should go there lives without watching at least once
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,Without a doubt one of the best movies that I've ever seen. People I know who dislike anime because of their shallow assumptions and prejudices have been amazed that anime could be more than just amusement for kids. Truly a quality film and experience.
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,I simply love this film! Wondefull visuals and sound with a heartwarming story and wonderfull characters. Yett another proof that anime is more than just Pokemon and Naruto.
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,An incredibly heartwarming and funny animation and alot of fun to watch. one of my favourites.
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,Satoshi Kon weaves one of the better dramas I have ever seen. You will fall in love with his memorable characters and story.
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,Excellently done. A very nice film for such a motley crew of characters.
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,"Satoshi Kon is great for one reason: he can do anything. Horror, drama, comedy - he can do each genre equally well, and he's a master of tying the loose ends together. Great film."
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,One of my favorite movies ever! Terrific friendship/road/chase movie. Love this directors stuff! Great stuff!
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,Anybody who wants to believe in miracles should see this! Hana is the best!

1.0,tokyo_godfathers,Incredibly charming and heartfelt movie. A true gem among Anime movies. Highly recommended.

1.0,tokyo_godfathers,heart warming [damn that sounds cheesy] and really funny. i like the cross dresser!
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,"Probably the oddest Christmas movie I've ever seen. A very warm tale, however. About the Good Christmas, not the fatman in a red suit crap."

1.0,tokyo_godfathers,"Excellent animation, excellent story."
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,An amazing movie about coming to terms with the past - it carries a message that we can't run away from who we used to be.
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,"A great example of a serious anime that sets a precedent that cartoons CAN be mediums to convey deep, real, and artistic themes without the use of giant robots or teenage girls in school uniforms with magical powers."
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,not quite the animation but the story is outstanding !
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,"Great story line, a must see."
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,"A humorous,but heart-warming anime!Great animation and story!"

1.0,tokyo_godfathers,Mutch better than i expected.
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,"One of Satoshi Kon's lesser-known films -- it's fairly dissimilar from his other movies, but still excellent. It's witty, dark, comforting, depressing... great animation, great story, wonderful characters. See it!"
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,The story is absolutly fantastic.
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,This is one i can watch over and over again.

1.0,tokyo_godfathers,AWESOME!!! I laughed and cried at the same time! Such a touching story!
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,"This is one of the best movies I've seen in a while. Lovable characters, a twisted and often comically cynical but all-in-all heartwarming storyline...I love it. A real story about the power of ""divine coincidence"", also known as ""sheer dumb luck. XD"
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,"Satoshi Kon is to adult animation (not porn, you rabid otaku), as Miyazaki is to Children's tales. Tokyo Godfathers casts homeless people as the saviors of a child that seems to be surrounded by miracles both big and small. If you like movies, in the slightest, watch this movie."
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,Beautiful and touching. Another masterpiece from director Satoshi Kon.
1.0,tokyo_godfathers,It's so amazingly awesome. Words can't even describe it. :)

1.0,tokyo_godfathers,Absolutely loved it!

1.0,emperors_new_groove,"Silly fun about a selfish emperor who gets transformed into a talking llama. It has much more comedy than a typical Disney film. My fave character is muscle bound, childlike, endearing (loves to cook), slow to figure out things (most of the time), Kronk, voiced by Patrick Warburton."
1.0,emperors_new_groove,everything about this is great. childhood movie btw
1.0,emperors_new_groove,David Spade would make a very good llama.

1.0,persepolis,"what a pleasure. i love it. this isnt much of a review, but i dont want to sit here trying to find words for it. it was interesting."
1.0,persepolis,"beautiful, spellbinding, sarcastic, and empathetic. these are all the components required to create a great memoir, and Persepolis suceeds tremendously."
1.0,persepolis,Completely mesmerizing. The graphic portrayal is perfect and sets for the bar for more like it. PLEASE!
1.0,persepolis,A very interesting story accompanied with equally interesting visuals. Persepolis proves that 2d animated films are far from dead.
1.0,persepolis,"An animated masterpiece based on the non-fiction graphic novels of Marjane Satrapi. Adult themed animation about a girl's struggle to survive and cope with Iranian society. Has romance, war and heartbreak all beautifully interwoven."
1.0,persepolis,"Simple, but highly effective animation, used to tell an extremely touching (and true) story. If you don't understand the political climate, this film is a good place to start. Highly recommended."
1.0,persepolis,Utterly amazing... I can't believe it is actually a cartoon. It's really interesting and invites the viewer to watch more. Simple events but a great plot indeed. This film must have won an Oscar... wonder why it didn't being so good?
1.0,persepolis,"absolutely captivating aninmated movie, essentially in black and white telling the tale through a young girl's eyes of what it was like as Iran changed 2 what it is 2day. I may well watch this one again! Recommended! Ih and apparently Iron Maiden helps !"
1.0,persepolis,"as someone who was born in Iran after the Islamic Revolution and grew up in such times, i was extremely touched and found this movie easily relatable. i also adore the the style of this movie, simple and sweet."

1.0,persepolis,Really great! Touching personal story of young girl/woman who went through Iranian revolution and then her struggle as a woman and as an Iranian woman in Europe. Great animation!
1.0,persepolis,i waited a long time to see it and it did not disappoint - beautiful in every way.
1.0,persepolis,A refreshing look at the human beings on the other side of the world.  I really enjoyed the style as well.
1.0,persepolis,"stunning. probably because it is autobiographical, but it sort of transcended animation and became real. every character was so fully realized. this is a must-see for everyone."
1.0,persepolis,"No cabe duda que los franceses son los que mejor saben hacer animacion para adultos. El estilo tan particular es lo que la hace hermosa, asi como la tormentosa y truculenta historia de la existencia de Marjane."
1.0,persepolis,"this warm but serious film is one of the most creative & unique work I've seen! shows the real meaning of the sentence ""A picture is worth a thousand words"". PERSEPOLIS is more than perfect! One of my favorites definitely !"
1.0,persepolis,Cause this film made me feel something I have never felt before: how is to grow up during war and in an authoritative environment . The animation is truly captivating and there is no lack of humor! Plus: I liked the end!
1.0,persepolis,"""Never forget who you are and where you're from."""
1.0,persepolis,I enjoy and liked this movie. I would say watch the version with French as the main language with English subtitles.
1.0,persepolis,"Persepolis es la mejor pelÃ­cula animada que he visto. Marjane Satrapi nos cuenta su propia historia acercÃ¡ndonos a la historia de su paÃ­s, conmoviÃ©ndonos y atrapÃ¡ndonos en el asombro de una cultura a la que nunca vimos tan cerca en una pantalla de cine."
1.0,persepolis,"This is a really good movie, poignant and witty. The graphics are lovely. The main character is sassy and relatable. The story is relavant and important."
1.0,persepolis,Simplemente excelente. la emotiva historia real de Marjane y de Iran desde la caida del Sha hasta el presente. Haganse un favor y veanla
1.0,persepolis,Extremely moving and funny at the same time. Brought back memories of watching from a distance -as a young girl myself from a neighbouring country in the 80's- what the people of Iran (and Iraq) went through. Great animation as well...
1.0,persepolis,this movie was absolutely splendid. plus im a animation fan so it was so nicely done and i learned a little history. also i love it in french with english subtitles. i love this movie.
1.0,persepolis,"I just got around to watching this... felt the timing was right with the recent election fraud in Iran... and my personal mood was just right at last. Such a moving animation with all the right elements. Sad, but beautiful."
1.0,persepolis,"Really, really good."
1.0,persepolis,brillante. el desfase de genaraciones se matiza en una sordida representación gráfica texturizada por la música y la desesperación humana por experimentar la vida.
1.0,persepolis,"Very touching story about a girl (from childhood to twenties) in Iran with all the political background (war, revolution, exile) and its interference with a personal level. :)I especially like the grandmother. :D"
1.0,persepolis,it's a very nice Movie about
1.0,persepolis,"Loved the film, great story, amazing visual. Marjane's grandma is the grandmother everybody would like to have."
