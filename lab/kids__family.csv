1.0,harry_potter_and_the_goblet_of_fire,An amazing addition to the franchise that has now become a family classic and must see. It involves many of the beloved moments and characters from the movies.

0.0,1196077-cloudy_with_a_chance_of_meatballs,"Little effort is put into Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs; jokes, characters and dialogue are all one-dimensional, and the treatment of the ""nerdy"" leads is inappropriate for a children's movie."

0.0,1196077-cloudy_with_a_chance_of_meatballs,"Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs is unfunny, has poor animation, and is just about as predictable as many animated movies are these days. The 1 hour 21 minutes felt like more than 3 hours. The characters were the worst part; as cliche as the Walmart smiley face."

0.0,1196077-cloudy_with_a_chance_of_meatballs,Absurd.. Whacky.. Nonsense.. A food-junky's dream.. None of the scenes made a sense at all. It's just a patience-testing movie!
1.0,1196077-cloudy_with_a_chance_of_meatballs,"This is at the TOP of the Hosanna Wants-to-see-it-List. It seems to be her exact brand of humor. SOOO, Mommy and Daddy are taking her out to eat (spaghetti, of course) and to the opening night as a late Birthday present."

0.0,1196077-cloudy_with_a_chance_of_meatballs,Why did they make this? I do not like this movie at all! Its forgettable and the only thing it expresses is its originalality. But to me its stupid and really annoying. Just overall overrated and lame.

It should be fun for both kids and adults."
0.0,1196077-cloudy_with_a_chance_of_meatballs,"'Sokay. Manages to become an extended metaphor for the US's out-of-control food industry and be occasionally witty along the way. Between this and Ratatouille, I prefer this (not high praise, but good enough)."

1.0,harry_potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban,Things done differently might not always offer the same quality experience unless if accurately timed with well balanced direction and masterful adaptation which Prisoner Of Azkaban doesn't seem to unduly overload with mixed factors from start to finish.
1.0,harry_potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban,"The best Harry Potter film in my opinion, it's beautifully directed and the actors performance is stellar especially by Watson. The last half hour is full of thrilling sequences and interesting plot twists."

1.0,harry_potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban,"Prisoner of Azkaban is the stylistic peak of the film series, and the last Harry Potter movie that didn't feel like the director was trying to get the movie out of the way with as little thought as possible."

1.0,harry_potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban,Even better than the first two (and those were classics) by embedding amazing visuals with a new direction that feels even more magical. Lets not forget the amazing music by John Williams- he outdid himself again. This film is amazing.

1.0,harry_potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban,"After his huge success as a director in the first two movies, Chris Columbus was served to be the co-producer with David Heyman and Mark Radcliffe. Michael Gambon replaces the late Richard Harris to play the role of Headmaster Albus Dumbledore."
1.0,harry_potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban,"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban isn't just great because of its terrific acting, magical effects, brilliant story, and mystifying action, but also because the presence of Alphonso Cuaron adds an exciting style to the Harry Potter saga. 10 out of 10 AMAZING"

1.0,harry_potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban,"Although Alfonso Cuaron only lasted for one film in this franchise, it was the one that swung the series into darker territories. Cuaron masterfully handles the whimsy and magic with a new, mature tone."

1.0,harry_potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban,The Prisoner of Azkaban for me is easily the best film in the series and was also probably my favorite book. Alfonso Cuaron does not disappoint.
1.0,harry_potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban,The best of the series by far. Cuaron's talent immensely changed the Harry Potter' s universe for good and served as foundation for the tone of the remaining of the sequels. The series lost a lot when Cuaron declined directing the rest of the episodes.

1.0,harry_potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban,"Three times a Charm! Alfonso Cuar√É√Ç¬≥n became the first Director to truly and properly catch the magical essence of J.K.

1.0,harry_potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban,The best of the series thanks to Alphonso Cuaron who can do no wrong in my book. He is the reason the later HP films are so good by setting the ground work in this film. This is the only film in the series that stands alone without the aid of its siblings.
0.0,harry_potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban,Worst harry potter movie ever. It doesn't even deserve the name. I can't believe they even let them release it. It was beyond awful- if you hadn't read the book you didn't understand it and if you had you were so pissed you saw red. It was random and confusing and just plain bad.

1.0,harry_potter_and_the_prisoner_of_azkaban,"Possibly my favorite movie of the series.

1.0,my_fair_lady,Possibly the best telling of the story. Audrey is lovely - and convincing as she steals every scene.
1.0,my_fair_lady,i just love this film. the only bad thing is that when they sing they where dubbed
1.0,my_fair_lady,The very delightful adaptation of one of the longest-running Broadway musicals is exactly the sort of formal Hollywood spectacle that just isn't made anymore.

1.0,my_fair_lady,A classical film for all ages...

1.0,my_fair_lady,"One of the finest musicals ever made and a great romantic achievement in the history of film. It makes you sing, laugh and sigh."
1.0,my_fair_lady,"Cute Ms. Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn) is ghastly blasted by accent mocker and linguistic specialist, Higgins (Rex Harrison) whose inclination towards perfect English accent makes him take up a challenge to turn Doolittle into a upward class lady. Funny and beautiful."
1.0,my_fair_lady,LONG LIVE REX HARRISON
1.0,my_fair_lady,A bit long but worth it. It's by far my favorite musical I've ever seen.
1.0,my_fair_lady,"Boasting incredible performances by the elegant Audrey Hepburn and the oustanding Rex Harrison, George Cukor's My Fair Lady is entertaining, beautifully made, charming and hilarious, building an ageless masterpiece of the musical genre that still manages to generate a comment on society."
1.0,my_fair_lady,The accent makes it entertaining for me.
1.0,my_fair_lady,"Rex Harrison gives the best performance of his career, however, the movie's ending is remarkably horrendous!"

1.0,my_fair_lady,"By George! They managed to outshaw old GBS... Never has a musical score been written so wonderfully in step with the original text (Pygmalion). And, of course, it helps that the great Rex can't carry a tune but stays wonderfully in rhythm during his recitatives."

1.0,princess_mononoke_1999,"Princess Mononoke is a classical film, not to mention the hard-boiled action and stuff.

1.0,princess_mononoke_1999,"Quite easily Hayao Miyazaki's best film. You can talk up Nausicaa all you want; it can't compare to this. Nature is revealed to be flawed, too, and man isn't representing the Devil Incarnate.  Cram it, James Cameron. Hayao Miyazaki has done it right."

1.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,"It's visuals may not be of the comprehension of some viewers (inluding me) but that can't remove the fact that Yellow Submarine is more than a musical, it's an authentic piece of art. Even many years after it's release, it has the same magic."
1.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,Endlessly inventive animation invigorates this tale of the Beatles saving a psychadelic fantasy land from a nasty horde of invaders. The images stagger the imagination and overall the film serves as the perfect complement to the Fab Four's late 60's material.

1.0,ponyo,This is a cute movie!
1.0,ponyo,"To me (my opinion) it is the best picture of 2009. It totally blows Avatar out of the water (and I love that movie too). Whenever I'm down and feeling sad, I play any one of Miyazaki's films and I feel good about everything again."
1.0,ponyo,"Once again Miyazaki shows the world how to do animation. This simple innocent story looks stunning (esp in HD). It made me want to live in the town where it is set! In many ways this story feels similar in tone to Miyazaki's other work ""My Neighbour Totoro"" (16.12.10) (26.10.11) (19.10.12)"

1.0,ponyo,This was another classic in my eyes
1.0,ponyo,"Beautiful, imaginative and utterly adorable."

1.0,ponyo,"Miyazaki has done it yet again. Absolutely beautiful film, wonderful story and his way of portraying little girls as strong, capable figures is inspiring and makes me proud to show his films to my own daughters."
1.0,ponyo,"My 2-3 year old nephew gets so excited when he watches this film. He sits and is completely enraptured the entire time. There are very few films for which this is the case. Miyazaki creates magic, and this goes back to the roots he created with Totoro. A wonderful film."

1.0,ponyo,Miyazaki dose it again. Just amazing

1.0,ponyo,Absolutely loved this one. So cute and visually stunning. The story is deep and enjoyable to children and adults alike. I am now officially a fan of Hayao Miyazaki. His animations have not yet disappointed me.
1.0,ponyo,"The animation tops everything Disney has ever done and the story, while a little complicated for children to grasp the whole depth, just means as kids watch it over and over as they mature they will always learn something new from it. Young love is the strongest love of all."
1.0,ponyo,"Hayao Miyazaki does it again. Ponyo recaptures the same magic left off from Spirited Away. English voice casting helps enlighten some of the strong points of each of the characters in this, once again, fantastic animated movie."

1.0,ponyo,Loved it. My son too!!!
1.0,ponyo,I love this movie!!!! Reminded me of the Totoro movie which I was obsessed with when I was little. Beautiful to look at with quirky and adorable charaters in a story that is based on my favorite movie in the world The Little Mermaid. Love!
1.0,ponyo,"I find it hard not to walk away from this film without a giant smile on my face. In typical Miyazaki fashion this is full of imagination, whimsy and just a (green) bucket full of charm. Loved it."
1.0,ponyo,"Magical. Miyazaki dazzles, as usual, with his incredible imagination and entrancing stories. It is, however, more entertaining when watched with the original Japanese track and English subs."

1.0,the_peanuts_movie,perfection for what we could have wanted to
1.0,the_peanuts_movie,The Peanuts Movie offers a colorful gateway into the world of its classic characters and a sweetly nostalgic -- if relatively unambitious -- treat for the adults who grew up with them.
1.0,the_peanuts_movie,"So well done! It was classic, simple, uplifting. With modern times they address Charlie's character and his flaws that other characters make fun of in a wonderful way that taught a lesson. I loved how you couldn't tell if it was 1955 or 2015."
0.0,the_peanuts_movie,"Was an alright movie, dragged on to long in my opinion. I almost fell asleep half an hour in."

1.0,the_peanuts_movie,It is so refreshing to see a remake the keeps the spirit of the original in tact! Most definitely worth the time and effort! I think that as long as the family keeps creative control there should be more of these. This is a must see for everyone who was a child or is one now.
0.0,the_peanuts_movie,"Boring, boring, boring!!! I felt no emotion at all during this movie... all the magic from the original tv animations was missing. :("

1.0,the_peanuts_movie,I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was a little long but so good and sweet and funny. A great tribute to the Peanuts legacy but a great movie and story all its own. This is one I will definitely buy on DVD.
1.0,the_peanuts_movie,"Heartwarming, simple, and fun! It pays homage to the classic TV specials and everything a Peanuts movie should be! If you enjoy smiling, go see this movie!"

1.0,the_peanuts_movie,A sweet and delightful kids movie that even adults can enjoy themselves. One of the best animated movies of the year next to Disney/Pixar's 'Inside Out' and one of the best movies of the year period.
0.0,the_peanuts_movie,I hate Christian cartoon films too old for to many
1.0,the_peanuts_movie,This was an incredible movie. I took my daughter and wife to see it and it is a spectacular family movie. We always watch all of the older peanut shows so my daughter loved being able to see one from her time. I would watch it all over again.

1.0,shrek_2,"Funny, brilliantly animated (for a 2004 film) and sometimes a bit dramatic as well, Shrek 2 successfully manages to live up to its Oscar-winning predecessor in more ways than one (including the introduction of Puss in Boots, voiced by Antonio Banderas)."

0.0,1010792-its_a_wonderful_life,Well it is definitely not a wonderful movie.
1.0,1010792-its_a_wonderful_life,"Maybe the best holiday film of all-time. There's some real magic at work here from Frank Capra, which is timeless. I almost tear up at the finish every time. I would say, however, that George Bailey probably owes his child's teacher an apology."
1.0,1010792-its_a_wonderful_life,"It's interesting to know that this timeless holiday classic actually wasn't a hit when it first came out on Christmas 1946, but was eventually embraced by millions. Cary Grant was considered for the role, but he was busy filming another excellent film, The Bishop's Wife, playing the angel Dudley."
1.0,1010792-its_a_wonderful_life,It's more wonderful every year I watch it. What makes me marvel at this film so much is how hard it would be to nail all these notes with a modern film.

1.0,straight_story,"Very slow, yet beautiful. It's all worth it for the ending."
1.0,straight_story,"Very delicate, warm and beautiful movie. While different from most movies of Lynch, it actually has the same delicate touch as the Elephant Man, which also was based on a true story."
1.0,straight_story,David Lynch se aleja de sus temas habituales y nos ofrece una historia simple y cautivante a la vez. Tiene muchos puntos a favor la m√πsica hecha por el gran Angelo Badalamenti las actuaciones de Sissy Spacek y un portentoso Richard Farnsworth. Entra√±able e imprescindible pel√¨cula.

1.0,straight_story,"May, shockingly enough, be Lynch's best work. Touching, extremely well acted and shot, and introspective about life, family, and the journey we all take, together and alone. And very down-to-Earth for Lynch. Farnsworth, though, deserves and award for this one."

1.0,toy_story_3,"This best ""Toy Story"" since the first."
1.0,toy_story_3,"A fitting end to one of the best trilogies ever, a trilogy that defined a generation. The ""incinerator"" scene is quite definitively the most moving scene I've seen on film. TS3 may be Pixars finest achievement, and it's leaps and bounds the best of the trilogy."
1.0,toy_story_3,"A beautiful conclusion that will bring tears to your eyes, especially if you've experienced what it's like to grow up."
1.0,toy_story_3,A perfect end to a perfect trilogy

1.0,toy_story_3,Another fantastic Toy Story movie
1.0,toy_story_3,"Here is a series I've grown-up with, and the creators were smart enough to age the story alongside that audience growth. What you have in the end is an emotionally-powerful conclusion to this wonderful franchise."

1.0,toy_story_3,"The epic conclusion to one the best animated film series of all time.

1.0,toy_story_3,"I resisted watching this movie for a long time, despite the rave reviews because I was never much of a fan of the series. But damn, what a powerful and emotional story! It's been years since I've shed tears over an animated film."

1.0,sound_of_music,My absolute favorite movie of all time! I can watch this over and over!

1.0,sound_of_music,Definitely a high point for Julie Andrews.

0.0,sound_of_music,"There really should be a support group for the psychological damage inflicted upon children who had to sit through this awful thing because it was ""good for them"" at a point when they didn't have the power to just say no when their parents dragged them to see this atrocious thing."
1.0,sound_of_music,If your not familiar with musicals. . .this is where you can begin. Based on the True story of the Von Trap family who use great family music to escape Nazi occupied Austria.
1.0,sound_of_music,Classic - Love this movie.
1.0,sound_of_music,"Let's get to the point, Sound of Music is one of the best musicals I've seen. Julie Andrews had a high goal to meet after doing Mary Popins and exceeded that goal. The singing was wonderful and so was the acting. The kids were perfect and so was all the other cast."
1.0,sound_of_music,"I think that giving it a perfect five star rating is very acceptable. Sure, some say it might be cheesy, but it tells a very grand tale. One that has violence, romance, a certain contempt feeling to it, and of course singing. The Sound of Music should be able to last decades."

1.0,sound_of_music,Possibly one of the safest films around for family viewing for all ages without watching Disney. Of course it is a quintessential fight between good and evil but it is predominately a happy film with some delightful music that lifts the spirits during an economic recession.
1.0,sound_of_music,The Sound of Music is one of my all time favourites. How could this not be in the 90%s?

1.0,howls_moving_castle,One of my favorite miyazaki films along with Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away. The gorgeous visuals and genuine characters more than compensate for the occasionally hackneyed storyline and abrupt ending.
1.0,howls_moving_castle,"Based on a series of children's books that I've never read, Howl's Moving Castle is poignant and tells a strong moral tale wrapped in the soul of a wizard, a witch, a fire demon, and a cursed little girl. I watch this whenever I need to feel there is hope in the world."

1.0,howls_moving_castle,"The strength of Howl's Moving Castle would be its amazing visuals and the steadfast, likable protagonist, Sophie, who shows us an example of a strong, humble and definitely not whiny heroine. It's weakness, however, is the horrible final ending that doesn't sanely explain anything."

1.0,the_muppets,"I laughed from beginning to end. It's so self aware, but at the same time maintains (strangely) a sense of class. This is the hipsters family film."
0.0,the_muppets,"The plot is drivel, the songs are contrived and don't work. So bad even the kids switched off halfway through. Needs a serious injection of charisma."
0.0,the_muppets,There are too many sycophants showering this with plaudits fuelled with a misguided sense of nostalgia. If you don't think the muppets are funny (and they're not - not really) then no enjoyment will be found here.
0.0,the_muppets,Watch the original Muppets movie. I was not fond of this...

1.0,the_muppets,"From a non-Muppet kid, here's a movie that offers more than we could hoped for. Entertainment, values, emotions and rhythm. Here's a movie with movie stars that doesn't steal the limelight from the story and the real star of this film. The Muppets is as Muppets are. So are you a Man or a Muppet?"

Highly recommended!"
1.0,the_muppets,Cute & funny! Great family movie!
1.0,the_muppets,A wonderful love letter to Muppet fans the world over. A real feel good movie leaves you with a warm fuzzy (or should that be Fozzie) feeling inside and a big silly grin on your face. Famous cameo's a plenty and toe tapping good songs finish of the perfect package.

1.0,corpse_bride,An excellent cartoon with now classic characters and songs. One of the best masterpieces by Tim Burton. Ops. I just copy pasted the nightmare before Christmas. Never mind. Still applies.
1.0,corpse_bride,Great movie! I've just now seen it and I really like this movie. It's a little predictable but that doesn't mean it's not good. Tim Burton did an awesome job and so did the cast.

1.0,corpse_bride,"A grim if not oddly sweet film adapted from old folk tale that feels as fresh as ever. It may be a bit on the short side, but it's a fun and imaginative that carries all the signature Tim Burton finesse and charm. Not his greatest work, but still a good one."

1.0,fantasia,one of my favorites. this was all done before CGI
1.0,fantasia,"Stunning and beautiful animation matches the music perfectly. While there is no concrete narrative, Fantasia doesn't need one as it is more along the lines of an experience than a traditional movie. An experience, I believe, that shouldn't be missed by any fan of animation or orchestra music."
1.0,fantasia,"Marvelous animation and wonderful music, a lovely mixture of the two"
1.0,fantasia,"Even at 71-years-old, Fantasia is a unique artistic experience that has yet to be properly duplicated. Walt Disney's one time failure has proven to be one of his biggest successes."

1.0,fantasia,I personally loved this film. I don't think you will enjoy on bit of it if you don't like artwork or music. I loved how they associated the film/ artwork in the same rythym with the music being played. It really bridged the gap between art and music.
1.0,fantasia,Chernabog (Satan) is the most compelling character of the entire film.
1.0,fantasia,Great visuals and Music 5 out of 5
1.0,fantasia,"I really liked this movie, because it is just great and soothing to listen to like it will always but you in a good mood. Also the colors and pictures are very cool too! They use classical music for this movie, like Bach. The first song they play gets kind of aggressive then goes soft."
1.0,fantasia,"Fantasia may not have any dialogue, but I have a feeling that that is what makes it great. The animation is over its head for the 1940s, and the music that accompanies the sequences is charming. This one is still perfect in my book."

1.0,fantasia,"This is, by far, one of Disney's best films of all time."
1.0,fantasia,"It's been said that Fantasia isn't as good for kids as much as it is for adults and nerdy kids. It's defiantly an acquired taste but never the less Fantasia is beautifully made movie with a unique strategy of storytelling, and in my opinion it is the best Disney movie ever made."
1.0,fantasia,This is the closest thing I've seen Disney do that transcends animation into the realm of art. It's real food for the soul stuff. And all of its small failures seem only to add shading and depth to the over all exquisiteness of the film.
1.0,fantasia,The best animated musical ever.
1.0,fantasia,Best Film when I was a child. This is just amazing
1.0,fantasia,music with visual effects in perfect harmony
1.0,fantasia,"An original, inventive, imaginative and creative experience that, found in only a handful of films, allows audiences to create their own interpretations of the images on screen and turn them into meaning. Beautiful, colourful and brilliant, its one of the first exercises in excess movies released."
1.0,fantasia,"Disney's best. It surprises me why films like 2001 and Fantasia (films with little dialogue) aren't common. I know audience have come to except speech in film, but the music gets by so much more and is fantastic."
1.0,fantasia,Ok...we need it with a new full digital recording.We also need another Fantasia in full 3d
1.0,fantasia,"A beautiful, colorful, animated movie with lovely music and excellent animation. 5 out of 5."

1.0,fantasia,"Definitely my favorite movie next to The Wizard of Oz, Fantasia has the sound and picture that captures audiences of all ages. With music pieces like The Sorcerer's Apprentice, The Dance of the Hours, and Ave Maria, this film is indeed one of Disney's best motion pictures if not the best."

1.0,coraline,Great animated film that has a distinct tone that might not suit everybody. The characters are strong and the direction is faultless. The film takes an interesting turn around the midway point that is typical of the author. I can't recommend this highly enough.
1.0,coraline,"muy buena pelicula animada,henry selick es genial,me sigue gustando m√°s el extra√±o mundo de jack ,pero esta peli es una obra maestra."

1.0,coraline,Loved it! I know its based on a book which I haven't read but it's imaginative and the action keeps going right to the end. The ending felt a bit rushed though but it would have been too long a film if it was longer.
1.0,coraline,"It is NOT a kids movie. NOT AT ALL. That doesn't make it bad though. Instead, it's one of my top 5 favorite movies of 2009. The animation, the colors, the terror, the 3D, the imagination = S.P.E.C.T.A.C.U.L.A.R."

1.0,hugo,My full opinion: 4/4.
1.0,hugo,"Director Martin ?Scorsese transforms Hugo into a magical cinematic experience, while also showing us how movies started in the first place. Hugo is a rare gem that pays homage to the legendary filmmaker, ?Georges M√©li√®s."
1.0,hugo,"Absolutely brilliant movie by Scorsese. It is a children's movie for adults. By that I mean that it has the whimsical feel of a children's film with young actors, but its plot has complexity more akin to that of an adults drama. Again, absolutely brilliant film."

1.0,hugo,"Scorsese's brilliant and ambitious 3D film is hauntingly beautiful and I gather the film industry considered it a flop at the box office... but then, so was the Wizard of Oz."

0.0,hugo,One of the worst movies I have seen
0.0,hugo,This movie is just a bloated contrived view into how cinema used to be a - guised as children's tale. Give me a break
0.0,hugo,"I felt like I wasn't ""in"" on this. It was pretty bad. Possibly the same experience as going to an art gallery with a horrible display, but no one would say ""this stuff really sucks"" because they feel like they're supposed to like it. Same thing. So I'll say it; ""This movie sucked."""
1.0,hugo,It's a 5 star. No doubt. And a lot of the fantasy is actually based upon historical fact. Wow! Not many will know the link to cinema history. I find this movie virtually flawless

1.0,hugo,"An amazing film. Two films combined to make a great film. First part is about Hugo Cabret, the second part is about Georges Melies and brought together by Scorsese with amazing storytelling and cinematography."
1.0,hugo,A story of a boy who wants to unlock the secrets of his father that leads him restoring Georges M√©li√®s film of works. And its equivalents to a magnificent film with superb cinematography and now we know why it is an Oscar contender. It is a Magical Scorsese film indeed.

1.0,rango,the best movie in the 20 century
1.0,rango,"George Lucas' company ILM proves to be a match for Pixar with their first animation, a dazzling fun ride that is also an entertaining homage to Westerns and the Italian spaghetti subgenre, deliciously subverting the figure of the anti-hero in a story with many welcome references."
1.0,rango,This tribute to the great spaghetti western has got to be one of the greatest animated films of all time.

0.0,rango,"This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Who ever thinks this is a good movie has no taste. The acting is quite mediocre, along with the plot being dumb and unoriginal. And I thought spaghetti westerns were bad. It's just bad!!!!!!!!"

1.0,rango,"Amazing, funny, just a must watch. Wasn't expecting such a good movie !"
0.0,rango,I wanted to watch it because of johnny depp but..not really my type of animated movies...

1.0,rango,"A surprisingly wonderful animated film with stunning animation, a wonderful script, and a typically great performance by Johnny Depp."

1.0,rango,"Very good and funny move with classic references, that will blow your mind"
1.0,rango,"Best kids show for grown ups, ever. Any kids show that has the words ""prostrate"", ""thespian*"" and ""mammogram"" hidden in the detail goes beyond clever. Bravo."
1.0,rango,This is a review on 6/20
1.0,rango,a very good animate movie with a creative cast and special for all the familie.
1.0,rango,One of my favorite movies of all time

1.0,rango,Funny and a little twisted here and there.
1.0,rango,"Original, creative and beautifully and comically rendered. Rango is one of the best movies of 2011 and one that showcases Johnny Depp at his flashy, unique and quirky best. And is also a surprisingly fun and entertaining tribute to the classic Western films of old. 5/5 stars."
1.0,rango,So amazing and funny!!
1.0,rango,"Its a really cute movie, my ONLY problem with it though is that watching literally makes me so thirsty lol..."
1.0,rango,Any hardcore moviegoers will love this movie. It's full of references and adult humor. Johnny Depp's voice acting is a highlight as well. This really isn't for kids or casual moviegoers because I can't imagine them getting any of the jokes. This was probably the best comedy of 2011.
1.0,rango,Loved it! Had humour depth to it & Rango is pretty awesome!
1.0,rango,This is my favorite movie ever! I can watch it over and over without getting sick of it

1.0,rango,"Jack Sparrow is now a chamaleon, and instead of being a pirate he is an actor pretending being a sheriff, well what I have to say about this movie is.... MAGNIFICENT! BEST WESTERN EVER!"
1.0,rango,This is the strangest film but is wonderful and realistic.Johnny Depp is great as Rango and the fantastic cast of desert critters are believable and very funny.The whole thing smacks of Blazing Saddles with Lizards and its unmissable
1.0,rango,Dark but fun for the kids
0.0,rango,"There is a fine line between being a tribute and a shameless pilferage of ideas. Rango is sadly the latter. Unoriginal and uninteresting and unfunny. I probably enjoy pointing out the movie references watching SCARY MOVIE, DATE MOVIE, MEET THE SPARTANS. etc"
1.0,rango,"Didn't expect this movie to be as good as it was, it's not what you will expect, a very good movie though."
0.0,rango,couldn't even watch all the way thru

0.0,rango,Did not appreciate the bad language and high violence in a children's movie.

1.0,rango,"A fantastic animation and movie and a real surprise! I didn't think I would like this as much as I did! Great humour, fantastic voice cast, great western setting and imaginative characters make this a real gem. Johnny Depp was fantastic as the lost chameleon! (7.3.11) (8.7.12)"

0.0,up,"Pull back from the cute humor and bright colors and you might realize the (hopefully)unintended message of this movie is that life sucks and all your dreams will fail. Seriously, list the main characters and what we know about them. Pretty depressing for a movie called 'Up'."

1.0,up,You know Pixar has created more than just a kid's film when you're entertained both as a child and an adult. Up has certainly set a standard that Pixar has yet to breach in its current timeline (though Toy Story 3 came close).
1.0,up,"This movie is a great argument for why the Oscars should have a ""Best Voice Acting"" category. Brilliant story as well, great visuals, sweet ending."

1.0,up,The Best Animated Film I've seen...
1.0,up,Pixar's best. Though I still never quite understood why Christopher Plummer's character was still alive...
1.0,up,"You'll have to suspend your disbeliefs, but once you do that you are in for one of the best animated films of all time. Simple yet deep, funny yet sad, touching and confirming.

1.0,up,Commovente. Davvero uno dei film piu' belli che abbia mai visto!
1.0,up,Pixar makes the best animated movie.
1.0,up,Best scenes are with the talking dogs! Hilarious.

1.0,up,"Up is touching, funny, clever and fun! The characters and the story are well shown. Up is the best Disney Pixar movie ever!"
1.0,up,"No other film is capable of making me laugh, cry or smile as much as 'Up'. This delightful story captures your heart in the first 15 minutes and it makes you laugh, as such an original idea should. Doug, Carl, Russell and Kevin are four great characters in one great story. Highly Recommended"
1.0,up,"One of the best, possibly THE BEST, Pixar film made to date. Such a heartwarming story, such a great message. Beautiful animation and characters as well. Overall, an extremely beautiful movie for all ages. Grade: A+"
1.0,up,Absolutely brilliant... Pixar at its best...
1.0,up,"Aug 2013 viewing: I forgot how much I really loved this movie. Changed it to 5 stars. :)Very cute, sweet movie. I would have liked to understand a bit more about why the adventurer turned from host to villain so quickly, but otherwise very enjoyable film."
1.0,up,Tugs the heart-strings. Another great family fave
1.0,up,Watched before July 2012
1.0,up,"This film is spectacular, it's start is heart wrenching, it's middle is funny, and the ending sends another perfect Pixar message, no matter how old you are it's never too late to have or be someone's adventure."
1.0,up,"another winner from Pixar. Simultaneously heartbreaking and remarkably uplifting, Up is one of the most enjoyable movies I've seen this year"
1.0,up,My favorite Disney/Pixar movie
1.0,up,The first 15 minutes of this movie. Wow. That alone is worth the price of admission.
1.0,up,"Brilliant film with many morals, themes and frienships. This is a film with a unique twist, and it made 4 unlikely people (and animals) best friends. Another great Disney film."
1.0,up,The Best Pixar movie besides Toy Story
1.0,up,"Brilliant, cute, action packed emotional film with a great plot."
1.0,up,"An amazing animated film, truly a joy to watch. Funny for grown-ups and kids alike, and the story is definitely suitable for both as well. A serious movie despite plenty of laughs to go around."
1.0,up,My daughter loves this movie!
1.0,up,"Seen this so many times, but I wouldn't mind watching it again. It's cute, clever makes you feel happy, and the sad beginning really hits you. I'd say one of Pixar's finest newer films."
1.0,up,"Up creates a better love story within 10 minutes between Carl and Ellie, than in the whole saga of Stephanie Meyer's Twilight."
1.0,up,"Defined heartfelt for me. Classic Pixar, Family-friendly story with a deep and touching message in the end. Definitely recommended."
1.0,up,One of Pixar's most touching stories.
1.0,up,"Loved this movie. Excellent story, very touching. I get choked up at the beginning of it and the little scout was 1000% adorable!!"
1.0,up,Another terrific Pixar movie
1.0,up,Beautiful and touching
1.0,up,This is the best Disney animation movie ever
1.0,up,An exceptionally unique masterpiece. Pixar proved it still has what it takes with this one.
1.0,up,I can't even begin to tell you how much I love this movie. The first 8 minutes of the film send you whirling through every emotion you have. This is one of my all time favorite Pixar films.
1.0,up,I could not love this movie more!
1.0,up,"One of my all time favorites. Dug steals the show. The first few minutes have almost no talking, but still told one of the best love stories ever. If you didn't cry in this movie you're a liar."
1.0,up,"A beautiful film for both children and adults alike. With the unusual quality of primarily being a children's film, while also tackling some of the deeper themes of life, that adults would relate to, heart-warming."
1.0,up,"Excellent movie! Most depressed Disney movie before Toy Story 3, but still good."
1.0,up,Animated Masterpiece...
1.0,up,"a heartbreaking romance between the old man and his wife, a father and son story between the old man and the kid, and an adventure story. mixing in some elements of a mid life crises film, and fantasy elements as well, and you got one of the best animated films of all time."
1.0,up,"First movie in a while to make me cry. Everything, from animation to storytelling is perfect."
1.0,up,One of the greatest and most tragic love stories ever told and that is just the first 10 minutes. Up has a lot to live up to considering the opening sequence and the plot requires the suspension of belief on epic levels but Up never fails to be great. All I can say is Squirrel!!
1.0,up,"A sad, but still heartwarming Pixar movie."
1.0,up,"Definitely my favorite animated film. One of my favorite all-time films. Arguably Disney-Pixars most sophisticated use of theme, message, and storytelling. At times funny but never gimmicky, at times devastatingly poignant but never sappy. A true must-see film for all ages."
1.0,up,Favorite movie of all-time
1.0,up,"This, in my opinion, is the best animated film ever. It's so touching, and very heartfelt."
1.0,up,Doug reminds me of my old dog it makes me happy
1.0,up,"Pixar's best movie. The plot is the creative, the characters are so loveable and in Dug's case adorable, and I have to mention the beautiful music. I love Up. Not only my favorite Pixar movie but my favorite movie period. SQUIRREL"
1.0,up,My Favorite Pixar movie of them all
1.0,up,"Exceeds expectations, even from Pixar."
1.0,up,"If I'm asked what's best of Pixar, I'll point my finger to this one."
1.0,up,Pixar does it again with this touching masterpiece. Anyone who's ever had a relative diagnosed with a fatal disease will truly connect.
1.0,up,the best kid moviefor adults
1.0,up,This is an amazing movie that proves that anybody can achieve something no matter how old. This is an amazing comedy and a great story. Pixar has done it again
1.0,up,One of the greatest animated movies since Disney's golden age. It tells an important story and deals with a difficult subject but is still fun for kids or anybody really.
1.0,up,This movie is perfect in every single way
1.0,up,nothing beats the first 10mins
1.0,up,An absolute masterpiece from the Pixar brand.
1.0,up,Best animated film in history
1.0,up,I laughed. I cried. I pretty much experienced the full gamut of human emotions.
1.0,up,"The first 7-10 minutes are movie making at its best, encapsulating two full lives in that short space of time. Amazing and deeply moving. The movie gets better from there."
1.0,up,This is 5/5 for the first 10 minutes alone
1.0,up,"by far my favorite pixar movie, possibly my second favorite animated movie"
1.0,up,"One of Pixar's best, what else can I say."
1.0,up,Really nice film can't believe I've only jus watched this.. Pixar r the best I liked the message.. Let things go and there is more important things in life.. :)
1.0,up,I always get tear up at the beginning of this masterpiece.
1.0,up,A movie about loss that leaves you uplifted. Another Pixar masterpiece.
1.0,up,"Pixar's uplifting, yet, somber tale of a widowed man whose journey of seeking to fulfill his wife's lifelong aspiration turns awry is, for a lack of a better word, a soon-to-be classic."
1.0,up,This movie made me cry and had deep underlying message. It was cute too.
1.0,up,Beautiful little love story intro and great message.
0.0,up,It tries to make you feel hope by showing you dazzling animation of an old man and a kid being really high in the sky. But there's no actual thematic elements or characterizations to make you feel this! It left me feeling more angered by fake hope rather than uplifted by real hope.
1.0,up,Great movie! Saw it with my kids and had to hide my tears at one point so they wouldn't see. This movie is way beyond expectations!
1.0,up,"Emotionally charged and very funny, this film will stick with you for a long time."
1.0,up,One of my Favourites
1.0,up,I love ice age 4I love up
1.0,up,"This was wonderful, with some elements that kids wouldn't really get or appreciate. I found the bond between Carl and Ellie touching and I hope I am lucky enough to find a love that lasts like that."
1.0,up,this movie is very tear jerking funny and quite mature at times One of Pixar's best
1.0,up,"Stay away from 3d. Doesnt work for everyone, even if you are pixar."
1.0,up,"""Up"" is one of the deepest films from Pixar. Only the introduction of the film is enough to make you leave the tears from your eyes. Definitely ""Up"" offers more than just a colorful adventure. And it lives UP to its name... XD"
1.0,up,excellent movie. I do not rate movies 5 very often this one is a exception. very funny especially dug. Carl is a grumpy but charming in a way and Russell is the type of kid you want to adopt. all I can say is WATCH IT
1.0,up,"Loved it loved it loved it. Really not a ""kid"" movie, but kids will enjoy it since it's a cartoon and there's occasional silly stuff... really is a story line geared towards adults, though."
1.0,up,I can't explain how great this movie is.
1.0,up,"Genial, super tierna. <3"
1.0,up,The montage about 10 minutes in makes me cry every time
1.0,up,wants to see it soooooooooo bad!
1.0,up,I saw the movie at cinema and really enjoyed it. It is good for adults too!!!
1.0,up,"It's truly marvelous how Disney keeps coming out with endearing Pixar films. This is a film that not only will children of all ages enjoy, but adults might also be touched by the heart-warming aura of Up."
1.0,up,I cryed at the beginning D: beautiful
1.0,up,One of the best Pixar movies ever.
1.0,up,it was interesting and exiting
1.0,up,I did cry but an amazing film :)
1.0,up,"First scene get's me every time....I have much emotion invested in this film (Ellie represents all my could-have-beens and losses) so I may be a little bias, but brilliant telling for a brilliant story. Filmography couldn't have been more perfect. Provides a perfect place on Pixar's Shelf of Fame."
1.0,up,An incredible cinematic achievement. Stirring in ways that may go over the heads of its younger audience.
1.0,up,enjoyable for the whole family
1.0,up,A+ Definitely a must watch.
1.0,up,It's the best movie Pixar has already done.
1.0,up,"A better love story than Twilight is described in the first five minutes. Possibly Pixar's best animation so far, besides Toy Story."
1.0,up,THIS IS A WARM HEARTED FLIM FOR ALL.I LOVED IT..
1.0,up,The most beautiful experience of the seventh art. A jewel of the film that gives a nod to childhood and old age so memorable. An unforgettable experience.
1.0,up,I think it's one of disneys best films and it's truly a rare masterpiece.
1.0,up,One of the best PG films ever made
1.0,up,very good movie I liked it.
1.0,up,The last REALLY good film Pixar made (as of this writing). Like Nemo it's one of the more emotional Pixar films but for the most part it's very light hearted.

1.0,1013970-miracle_on_34th_street,This timeless Christmas classic is good on any occasion. Edmund Gwenn completely sells his Oscar-winning performance as Kris Kringle (aka Santa Claus?). The cast and script are uniformly excellent. This is one of the most uplifting films of all time.

1.0,1013970-miracle_on_34th_street,"The greatest feature of Santa Clause ever told, doesn't much address that Christmas is about Christ, but plays to the budding commerical whims of Macys, (the idea of a fat Santa Clause), and the beginning of modern postwar commercialism.

1.0,pinocchio_1940,Definitely one of Disney's most ambitious animated features.
1.0,pinocchio_1940,One of the great films from the era of Walt Disney himself!
1.0,pinocchio_1940,This was the first VHS we had. I probably watched this hundreds of times when I was a kid. After re-watching this I'd have to say that this has the best animation of all the Disney classics. Great.
0.0,pinocchio_1940,"Very unrealistic and childish. I expected more action, blood and guts from a Disney movie. -5,000,000/10 banish to hell."
1.0,pinocchio_1940,+ The crown jewel masterpiece of Disney animated magic- probably not best for youngsters
1.0,pinocchio_1940,"Pinocchio's charm is undeniable; it's dark, very funny in an almost adult way, and Cliff Edwards' Jiminy is a great character. The best Disney film from the 40's, definitely."
1.0,pinocchio_1940,"Richly drawn with memorable characters and beautiful songs, Pinocchio is an early Disney classic, embodying everything you'd expect from a Disney cartoon. It's hard to think of a sweeter film, combined with humour and some genuinely distrubing moments; Pinocchio is an ageless treat."
1.0,pinocchio_1940,only one word for this Perfect

1.0,1042582-aladdin,Robin Williams is unforgettable as the Genie in this fantastic adventure. The music numbers somehow still manage to be hip and heart-felt at the same time. Its story is simple but it's told with incredible charm from a real golden period in Disney's history.

0.0,1042582-aladdin,"This is where Disney started to unravel for me. Making films for adults AND kids is one thing, but then forgetting about the kids and aiming squarely at the adults? Horrible really, especially Robin Williams doing impressions for half an hour. If I wanted to see his stand-up material, well, I don't."
1.0,1042582-aladdin,"One of the most exciting films there are. There's excitement, action, drama, and comedy. It's all very well done in here. It's #14 on my list. One of the well known films of the Renaissance era."

1.0,how_green_was_my_valley,"Ok, call me a sucker for sentimentality, but this is one of the only films that actually moves me to tears.

1.0,how_green_was_my_valley,Heart-wrenching and uplifting at the same time. Maureen O'Hara was never lovlier and Walter Pidgeon never sexier. John Ford is a master and it shows.

1.0,paranorman,"Beautifully animated, wonderfully scored, and amazingly written. This is probably one of the most thoughtful and tender explorations of alienation and bullying in Children's cinema, and has many winks and nods to horror classics to boot.So far my favourite movie of 2012."
1.0,paranorman,Very good movie reminds me of a game called zombies ate our neighbors a Super Nintendo game

1.0,about_elly,"A gripping saga of a holiday gone wrong. Though this film is significantly dark in comparison, many aspects of it reminded me of 'Dil Chahta Hai'. Brilliant acting by the entire cast, and kudos to the director for keeping the plot tight from beginning to end. Highly recommended."

1.0,about_elly,Beautiful script fabulous theme and as usual another master piece
1.0,about_elly,"Almost if not as compelling as his ""A Separation"", director Asghar Farhadi proves once again to be a maestro of drama both in direction and writing, and instill the idea that a world is always going on outside the frame of the camera."

0.0,about_elly,"Save your money, boring with nothing but squabbling!"
1.0,about_elly,Farhadi is a genuine cinematic genius and this is his third film is a row that could arguably be defined a masterpiece. Not since A Separation has a film left me so anxious and emotionally strung out. This is by far the best film I've seen this year.

1.0,tangled,Beautiful music and endearing characters! I have no idea why Frozen gets more cred ?!
1.0,tangled,"My favorite Disney movie excluding Pixar. This was the type of movie that had me thinking about the repercussions of the final scene for days after my first watch. That's right. A 22 year old man on a high protein diet, somewhat emotionally upset from a Disney princess movie. Three thumbs up."
1.0,tangled,Very cute Disney movie! The chameleon and the horse are the best!
1.0,tangled,Genius and probably the most stunning 3-D cartoon ever made where Disney actually makes 3-D look as masterful as their 2-D animated movies. So awesome every time I watch it.
1.0,tangled,My favorite character was Flynn Rider he was a wanted thief and the Palace guards where chasing Flynn and his 2 side kicks now that was funny a long the way he meets Rapunzel.

1.0,tangled,"Tangled should just be renamed ""Watch a This Instead of Frozen!"" While Frozen was a sloppy yet predictable movie, Tangled is a fun, silly, and beautiful movie. I really shouldn't have to say anything else. Just do yourself a favor and watch it."

1.0,iron_giant,"A cartoon with depth. It's always going to ""miss"" some people, because they aren't willing to let the movie inform them what the theme is. They came for fun, silly laughs, or whatever, but this movie is about relationships and it's wonderful at that."
1.0,iron_giant,I love this movie! The Iron Giant will appeal to people of all ages.
1.0,iron_giant,"My family quotes this movie all the time! If you haven't seen this, you should. I love it!"

1.0,iron_giant,One of the best movies I've ever seen.
1.0,iron_giant,my favorite part was Vinn diesel (truck) as the robot and I Can't stand anything else about this smelly robotic smarmfestival movie. I would rather lick my grandfathers schwarma than have to view this again.
0.0,kung_fu_panda,So I saw part of it and it was not entertaining and I didn't really consider it a martial arts movie which I figured it wouldn't be so I'm not for this movie

1.0,kung_fu_panda,wow wow wow. This is a genius. It's a KUNG FU PANDA. A KUNG FU PANDA. Who doesn't like Kung? Who doesn't like fu? Who doesn't like pandas? If you're 5 you can watch this if your 90 you can watch this; 11/10. Would watch on 20-hour loop.

0.0,kung_fu_panda,"Pretty much a Jack Black monologue (and not his best), this is a film for really little children. This will take a lot of kids into martial arts.

1.0,antz,'Existentialism is an ANTism.' This has to be one of the best underrated 'kids' film ever. Holds WAY up.
0.0,antz,"When you would compare it to A bug's life, you would be dissapointed how much DreamWorks has copied from it. While a bug's life is childish and funny, Antz uses excessive idiocy to make people laugh. Truth to be told it does not deserve 95%. Good actors have wasted their talents on this film."
1.0,antz,"surprise, it's a cute movie"
1.0,antz,I love the story that the creators try to tell
0.0,antz,"Antz is a movie that takes it itself WAY too literally; and after a while, not only does it become boring, but annoying."
0.0,antz,"Just because there is a prolific director voiced a character, doesn't mean you should look past the actual plot and seriousness of the movie. Blatant rip off of A Bug's Life."

1.0,antz,A very well executed animated film that has been forgotten.
1.0,antz,"Maybe not by much appealing in color and visual but in the flow of the story and the outstanding star power voices of the the cast, for sure the 'Antz' will certainly captivate you and your eyes to keep on watching..."

0.0,antz,I did't like this one much at all. A knock off of Bug's Life which I didn't like much either.
1.0,antz,Woody Allen as an animated ant. What could be better?
1.0,antz,You Just Asume it's Antz. And It is Antz.
1.0,antz,seen it with my nieces
1.0,antz,ME ENCANTO!!! DEJA UN BUEN MENSAJE Y ES MUY TIERNA!!!
1.0,antz,The movie is ery hilarious and amazing. It remembers me my childhood. From my point of view it is better than PIXAR's A Bugs Life.
1.0,antz,A movie about bugs hmmm....
0.0,antz,I just don't like any movie with ants in it =P
1.0,antz,One of those classic CGI cartoons that bring back the happy days of when I was a six year old
0.0,antz,"Should not be on top movies ever. Boring characters, decent plot, nasty animation."
1.0,antz,"In my opinion this is Dreamworks best film. Funny, mature and wonderfully animated, too bad Dreamworks would rather make films stuffed with pop culture references then this."
1.0,antz,love this film so much
0.0,antz,Hated it....probably because it came out the same year as A Bugs Life.
1.0,antz,"The movie's higher intelligence and advanced use of it's premise showcase DreamWork's penchant for non-catering, which makes it's thematics feel more admirable, if a little alienating, considering its time and mixed appeal."
1.0,antz,Woody Allen and Jennifer Lopez made this movie funny and clever. A great family movie for sure.
0.0,antz,This movie is terrible in every way and a horrible excuse for an animated film. The film reeks of Bug's Life knock-off and was poorly executed across the board.

1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,One of the best animated movies of the year
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,"A delightful adaptation, and an intriguing amalgamation of Anderson's style and stop-animation. His familiar flair seems right at home and the voice work is superb."
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,Brilliant. Visually Stunning.
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,This movie should have won best animated feature.
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,"egy mese amiben figyelnek a k√©pkiv√°g√°sokra, a dial√≥gusokra, a karakterekre, a helysz√≠nekre, a zen√©re. ez√©rt zseni wes anderson. im√°dom:)"
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,seems interesting especially with Wes Anderson directing.
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,This movie is Fantastic!!!!
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,"Introduced me to Wes Anderson, who is now a favorite filmmaker of mine. Such a good idea to let him loose on one of Roald Dahl's classic works"
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,"Just... wait for it.... Fantastic! The voice cast are all hilarious and great, the animation is very quirky and just lovely to behold, the music is good as expected from Anderson, and the tale is wonderfully adapted to fit the screen whilst never betraying it roots too much, wonderful!!"
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,"Wes Anderson's worst film, yet it still remains in my top 50. Wes Anderson could really abuse his usual artistic shots when using puppets, but there is something missing from this film, maybe it's the lack of the usual care Anderson puts into his characters. I still recommend it."
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,One of my favorite movies of all time! have watched it several times and pick up something clever each time.....
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,"Fantastic Mr. Fox is exactly that, Fantastic. There was not a moment when this movie was truly terrible. It's creative, it's witty and it's downright funny at times. They were also smart to keep Owen Wilson's part to a minimum."
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,Really fun and different.
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,"A great film to see, and one of Anderson's best. It has all of those quirky things you would expect from a film by Wes. It has a great story fun characters as well. Another plus for this film is the interesting art style that makes this film unique."
0.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,"I think I laughed twice. It strayed further from the story than Maddie from Portugal. 40 minutes felt like an hour and a half. it's dry, unfunny and boring. A wholly unnecessary and dreadful murder of a Roald Dahl classic."
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,"I saw this on tv the animation and story was very good, it was also slightly funny too"
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,Brilliant. Voice cast do an amazing job.

1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,"Thought it would be too ""adult"" for the kids but they enjoyed it so much in their own way. I, on the other hand, was intrigued by Clooney and Streep's calming voices amidst such chaos, music of the 60s and the unexpectedly amazing animation (if this can even be called animation). Just excellent."
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,The script for this film is the best animated film script ever written
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,"Extraordinary, stop animation is perfect for Anderson's meticulous eye and it serves not only as a playful adaption of the children's book, but a commentary on society, and a tribute to the man Dahl himself. One of Anderson's best."
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,The best animated movie I have ever seen. Hilarious and brilliantly crafted. One of the few movies that deserves 5 stars
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,"hilarious, and gets funnier every time I watch it."

0.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,Really boring and filled with extremely ugly animation.Voice acting:CPlot:FEntertainment value:F!
1.0,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,I was pleasantly surprised by this film & my kids loved it. It's hard to believe its all animated & every little detail is amazing. George Clooney & Meryl Streep's voices just add to what is already a powerful storyline and a classic from Roald Dahl!

I went ahead and watched it because I'm a HUGE Disney fan and loved every bit of it. The soundtrack was great and I plan to buy the songs. I find myself singing them daily."
0.0,moana_2016,"This movie was terrible. It is filled with tons of plot holes. If the water is so amazing, why doesn't it just bring the heart to Tafiti by itself? Only one song was worth anything. Would not recommend."
