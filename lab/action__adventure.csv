0.0,drive_2011,"Beside Goslin, I don't get the fascination for these film honestly."
0.0,drive_2011,"I never thought i can be disappointed with a film, but this proved me wrong. The actors are amazing, but the dialogue and plot are very poor"
1.0,drive_2011,very very underated movie.
1.0,drive_2011,"Drive is an intense and incredibly powerful film from the first frame until the last. Fueled with hyper-stylized violence and music, director Nicolas Winding Refn and actor Ryan Gosling have created an arthouse masterpiece. This film will keep you on the edge of your seat the entire 100-minutes."
1.0,drive_2011,This movie has a lot of style and substance. Insanely cool film with the best romance story I've seen. Just don't expect a lot of action.
1.0,drive_2011,"A slowly paced, ultra-violent, expertly-directed crime masterpiece with a very strong, yet nuanced performance by Ryan Gosling.5/5 stars"
1.0,drive_2011,"One of my top 10 favorite movies- cinematography is amazing, 80s soundtrack is the coolest contrast to the mood of the movie, I can't say enough good things about Drive."
1.0,drive_2011,Excellent flick that treats cars as a tool to further the story but not dominate it. A hidden gem.
1.0,drive_2011,A masterpiece and one of the best films of our time. There is nothing major wrong with it and you just can't hate it. Except if you expected an action film. Then I'm sorry.

1.0,drive_2011,One of the greatest films ever made. And I am not afraid to say that
1.0,drive_2011,"Violent, romantic and visually stunning, Winding Refn transforms his LA setting into a contemporary oasis where doomed love and the brutal restrictions of reality are around every corner, and cars are the poetic vehicles which help speak for the lead character within them."
1.0,drive_2011,"The original Baby Driver. Between the invigorating score and the apparent ""underground"" feel of an 80s like city, this movie will leave you thinking for a long time. A modern day classic."
1.0,drive_2011,"Drive is one of my favourite movies of all time. The visuals are breathtaking, beautifully shot. The plot is solid and performances are understated but great. Love Drive, it's a classic."
0.0,drive_2011,So disappointed. No redeeming qualities even with Ryan Gosling. The soundtrack was unbearably awful. I'm going to forget about this movie and pretend I never saw it.
1.0,drive_2011,Ryan Gosling gives an incredible performance in this violently awesome car chase and mob movie that works on almost every level!
1.0,drive_2011,Movie is a modern masterpiece.
1.0,drive_2011,Albert Brooks makes a great bad guy. Really solid movie with atmospheric soundtrack.

1.0,drive_2011,"Seamless combination of Arthouse-action-noire, Drive creates an atmosphere and sets a pace like no other film. Stop looking at reviews and watch this film."
0.0,drive_2011,Awful. No point with weak plot and unnecessary violence. Just weird.
1.0,drive_2011,"This movie will let you know weather your a casual movie-goer or a lover of the cinema more than any other movie. NWR Magnum Opus, the music is gorgeous, the forced perspectives and use of subtext are a reason this movie is the best I have ever seen."
1.0,drive_2011,"A masterfully acted, Amazing picture resolution, with an outstanding soundtrack. This darkly suspenseful movie shows complex layers to a character who's name we don't even know. Well directed it's a modern masterpiece to those who know what a true movie is, and where it can transport you."
1.0,drive_2011,"Amazing cinematography and a great script. Much more ""artsy"" than you would think based on the trailer / poster."
0.0,drive_2011,"Horrible. 2 hours of my life I'll never get back. The plot is week at best, the characters have no depth (or dialogue got that matter) and it's the same played out story line we've seen over and over. Worst. Movie. Ever."
1.0,drive_2011,This movie made me realize I had a passion for film making
1.0,drive_2011,Never wanted it to end. Everything about this movie was perfect. Acting especially. Albert Brooks is amazing. Ron Perlman too. Bryan Cranston. Just incredible. Definitely a guy movie. Every guy wants to be the driver. The best vigilante movie ever made.
1.0,drive_2011,One of my favorite films of all time. The only people that don't appreciate the film for what it is are the people that were expecting some 'Fast and Furious' action movie but it is so much more than that. 5/5 easily.
1.0,drive_2011,"""An artful, impressively made film, and one sure to excite cinephiles, everyday adrenaline junkies, and fans of stylized car chases set to an indie synthpop soundtrack."""
1.0,drive_2011,"Beautifully shot, well acted, understated with realistic violence in just the right places (jarring). Albert Brooks better get a nod for best supporting actor. I especially liked the unique use of nonlinear storytelling, I never quite knew where I was ... Kept me just slightly uncomfortable."

1.0,drive_2011,I still can't figure out why a genre film as thrilling as this was didn't turn out to be a huge financial success. I have no problem with figuring out why the director's next film ONLY G_D FORGIVES was a bust but this? *shrugs*

1.0,drive_2011,"This is my first time watching art house films, and I gotta say thank god I did. Sure the movie kind of drags after the first sequence. But the cinematography, soundtrack, acting and the characters are where it's at. Drive is not a film for mainstream audiences, but for any movie lover out there."
1.0,drive_2011,This is my idea of a perfect movie. The original soundtrack collaborates almost too well with the emotion that is in this movie. King Gosling!
1.0,drive_2011,It's pretty much an art house Transporter but it is a beatiful looking film. Wow. Talk about great lighting. Every single actor is outstanding. I must say you have to watch this movie more than once to fully grasp its message. Phenomenal film.

0.0,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,A movie written by anti-fa. All nationalists are mental cases or Uncle Toms that are dead-set on enslaving other races to build a wall. The only ones that are to be spared are the voiceless blonde ladies they take with them.

1.0,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,"Although a very slight drop from the previous film (Dawn) being a bit long/slow at times, it does continue to entertain and keep the reboot collection in tact.

1.0,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,"War is one of the best films in general and one of the best third films in a trilogy that completes the arcs it created for its characters, tells a unique original story while also homaging that makes sense, but also does unexpected things with story and how it plays out."
1.0,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,Serkis and Harrelson sky rocket this movie into being perhaps better than it has any business being. Its commentary on the way we treat one another within society and what truly makes us human is astoundingly visceral and though provoking. Maybe the best film of 2017.
1.0,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,"Wow. That's all I have to say, it was brilliant. The story is complex and interesting, there were certainly a lot of emotional parts and the action wasn't the best but still one of the best I've seen in a long time."

1.0,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,"Perhaps the best film of 2017.

1.0,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,was a very good movie..
1.0,one_false_move,"A smart movie with well fleshed-out characters and music that adds to the story in effective ways. There's a lot of violence and the ending is a bit abrupt, but those aren't criticisms as much as observations. All around a solid thumbs up. R.I.P., Bill Paxton."
1.0,one_false_move,"Billy Bob Thornton and Tom Epperson have written a violent crime thriller, directed by first-timer Carl Franklin who expertly guides us in a threateningly mounting wave of suspense until the astoundingly powerful dramatic finale."
1.0,one_false_move,Nobody saw it but it was the thriller of the year. Good stuff
1.0,one_false_move,very enthralling cop drama with all the stops. great film for a first time director. gritty and full of suspense. perfect roles for Both Bill's. very good build up all the way through. great character building.
0.0,one_false_move,The characters and dialogue is cliche and uninteresting so much so that I could not even watch the entire film. Boring. Dull. Predictable. Irritating.
1.0,one_false_move,No doubt this is one of the best ever pragmatic film noir ever made.
1.0,one_false_move,"simple plot, great cast, excellent performance by Billy Bob.."
1.0,one_false_move,"Wow, why have I never seen this movie?"
1.0,one_false_move,Great performances and screenplay (co-written by co-star Billy Bob Thornton) along with a biting criticism of race relations in the rural south. The ending is devastating but strangely beautiful at the same time.

1.0,one_false_move,"A real good thriller, Bill Paxton is real good as is Billy Bob throton who co-wrote the movie."

1.0,one_false_move,Here's another film rating.
0.0,one_false_move,one of the worst movies I have ever seen
1.0,one_false_move,Thought it was great the first time that I saw it and it stood up on the second and third viewing. It had some technical problems.

1.0,right_stuff,"My favourite movie. The most heroic, funny, touching film I've ever seen. But will probably only really appeal if you're male. All that is right and wrong about being a man. And it's all true."
1.0,right_stuff,"A great film about the death of the air age and the birth of the space age. Several scenes poetically reveal the changes our nation went as we made that transition. And the film is packed with this kind of veiled humor, especially apparent in any scene with the two Gov't agents!"
0.0,right_stuff,Over three hours long and turns a fantastic historical story into a sleep inducing snore fest. Dissapointing! And it won Academy Awards?!?
1.0,right_stuff,"If you've read the book, you'll understand it better. Dennis Quaid and Ed Harris tear it up. Great SFX for 1983."

1.0,right_stuff,A must for anyone who are interested in air and space.

1.0,right_stuff,I have to maintain an even strain to watch this movie--Tom Wolfe got it right and Sam Shepard is vintage Yeager!
1.0,right_stuff,"Why this didn't win best picture is beyond me. It was nominated. This describes the kind of character, strength and tenacity the first astronauts had before we went to the moon. Ed Harris plays a very convincing John Glenn. I'm greatful thye take some time to show the wives of these brave brethren."
1.0,right_stuff,"""Put the spurs to 'er Chuck!""It's long and slow but start watching and you won't stop. In terms of the span of time it covers and the monumental human achievement it documents it is a true epic."

1.0,right_stuff,Wow. Americans make a film that celebrates the US of A while at the same time poking some good natured fun at it all. One cannot pay the makers a greater compliment than to say they captured Tom Wolfe on celluloid. Oh and Levon Helm makes a great narrator.

1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,An excellent movie of good olden days
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,I was skeptical because I don't usually like war movies. But this film was a masterpiece. The last 30 minutes rank among some of the most exciting moments I've ever seen in a film. It has all the emotion and thought of a Greek tragedy. Bravo.

1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,"Alec Guinness as obsessively principled Colonel Nicholson, the role revels in its moral ambiguity. The battle of wills between Nicholson and Saito, played by Sessue Hayakawa, propels the film to its closing line (""Madness... Madness"")"

1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,"Another classic Sir David Lean epic. Besides brilliant script-writing about the cultural differences between parties, it celebrated the matter of 'principles' and a man's determination to uphold it. Nobility and graciousness of the trully remarkable Sir Alec Guinness shall never be forgotten!"
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,My dad told me that they built a replica of the bridge for kids to play on at the drive-in near where he grew up. It was built by the children of English POWs and then blown up to prevent model trains from traversing it.
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,"Too brilliant for a short review. Interesting take on how one perceives the psychology of Guinness' character Nicholson but more importantly, the way the climax was handled - just epic. Lean really dished us a masterpiece."

1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,"Amazing blockbuster from 1957, hasn't aged a bit. Holden and Hawkins excellent but it's Alec Guinness who really pulls it out...he's magnificent. Jack Hildyard's cinematography is sumptuous, shot in Sri Lanka."

1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,A war movie classic that really shows the growth of an obsession in a genuine way.
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,You could take away pretty much every English-language war movie ever made and we wouldn't lose anything as long as we still had this one.
1.0,bridge_on_the_river_kwai,"I saw this movie just yesterday and I think it is one of the best movies ever made, the acting is perfect, the directing, the locations, ... . The whole movie is just perfect. I liked the tensions between the colonel and the japanese warlord"

1.0,1001577-badlands,"Malick's Badlands, while not 100% true to his later-developed style, is still a cerebral character analysis of the minds of two people in love who have lost their innocence but ultimately fail due to their youthfulness."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Perfectly combining two characters of either sadistic, egocentric, or emotionally distant personalities, Badlands blends together a tight execution with a glorious poetic delivery."
0.0,1001577-badlands,"I can't believe the high ratings by some peopleI have seen hundreds of top movies of all kindsThis is one mindless, horrible script of a movieThe violence makes no sense AndHow did Martin Sheen become the greatest shot in the world?Does anyone else care about that?Complete waste of time!!"
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Simply one of the richest, most intriguing films in the American cinematic canon."
1.0,1001577-badlands,What a gem! Stumbled across this film last night and couldn't stop watching. Def. a must see.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"A very American debut from Malick, repressed, gorgeous, and quietly philosophical."
1.0,1001577-badlands,Sheen and Spacek were unknown at the time and this was Malick's debut so it was overlooked. They're finally catching on.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"It has quickly become one of my favorite movies of all time. Brilliant performances, steady directing, beautiful cinematography and a great score. Surprisingly funny thanks in large part to Martin Sheen's droll wit in the part of the sociopath Kit."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"A young Midwestern couple go on a senseless killing spree. A hauntingly poetic debut rife with violence, love, & beauty."
1.0,1001577-badlands,The brilliant debut of Terence Malick is measured like a beautiful poem and chock full of sumptuous visuals. 'Badlands' is an impressionistic dream of a film.
1.0,1001577-badlands,A film about nihilism. A film about hate and love.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Incredible. Great story told in unbelievable fashion.
1.0,1001577-badlands,This movie was beautiful in every aspect; a visual poem of the death of freedom.
1.0,1001577-badlands,The ending sums up everything.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Wow. Finally saw this and understand the fuss about Terrence Malik - and Martin Sheen as well. Masterful.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"I mean, come on. It's Terrence Malick."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"I basically love all things Malick. This isn't my favorite amongst his movies, but it' still pretty spectacular."
1.0,1001577-badlands,One of my all time favorites.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Obra máxima de Malick, onde tudo funciona e tem em seu elenco sua maior força."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Fantastic. It is a dreamlike tale of murder, blind love, and the desire to escape. Malick is a truly masterful filmmaker."
0.0,1001577-badlands,"This turns an ugly spate of serial killings into a rhinestone cowboy, ready the real story to see how ugly the murders were... joke.."
1.0,1001577-badlands,So disturbing yet beautiful at the same time. A true American masterpiece.
1.0,1001577-badlands,So Spare & Poetic it chills you to the bone
1.0,1001577-badlands,Terrence Malick's best film. Cinematographic masterpiece of a cowboy brand James Dean running from the law with a girl far too young for any good. Loved it
1.0,1001577-badlands,"The greatest debut film since Citizen Kane. Malick transcends the genres this film milks to create a statement about America that few dared to enunciate. The emptiness of the landscapes, the self-lies and movie-derived self-images haunt the viewer."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Badlands is really that good; beautifully constructed, impeccably script, but for the film buffs, it is the perfect film about a serial killer on the run for the American Dream."
1.0,1001577-badlands,A masterpiece with unique moments of transcendence and horrifying beauty as well as an excellent Martin Sheen and a perfect and natural Sissy Spacek who enlightens the screen with her vibrant honesty.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Terrance Malick's AUDACIOUS debut!! Film as art!
1.0,1001577-badlands,"A beautifully shot tale of murder, angst, individualism and a white t shirt that just never gets dirty no matter what is thrown at it."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Excellent Bonnie and Clyde style movie by Terrence Malik. I'm yet to see a stinker by this guy. Fabulous vacuous and wastelandish scenery. As the death tolls keep on mountain, so does the gripping tension. Martin Sheen was fantastic as the cool laid back Kit"
1.0,1001577-badlands,A strangely poignant and hypnotic film.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Few filmmakers can carve their own cult and call it art in Hollywood. Terrence Malick is one of those filmmakers.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Badlands is Moonrise Kingdom with bloodshed not strictly limited to dogs.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"What an incredible debut from Malick. Still as fresh and beautiful today, especially in the gorgeous new criterion transfer. This is his best film, a masterpiece on all levels."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Malick's first film venture is my personal favorite, because its the least Malicky one of the lot. This is because a narrative is present, and he actually cares about the performances here. A delightful little crime saga of two teenagers on the run from the law."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Remarkable debut - Malick sprang forth fully formed, like Venus from the sea. His trademarks are in place: gorgeous, naturally lit cinematography and day-to-day actions set against vast landscapes. This is finally being released on Blu-ray by Criterion!"
1.0,1001577-badlands,"When pared down a bit, Badlands can be described as a road movie. Since the main characters and where they go are the most important aspects of most such films, and Malick's lead actors both give great performances, Badlands works on many levels."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Malick's first movie may not be as challenging or arresting as some of his later work, but Badlands still gave me a taste of pure cinematic poetry."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Malick's debut is still one of the greatest films in existence, there's really nothing more I can say about it without writing pages upon pages of praise. If you haven't seen it, watch it, then watch it again."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Badlands is a stellar work of American filmmaking, packed with the visual beauty and dignified performances that would distinguish the films of director Terrence Malick."
1.0,1001577-badlands,Terrence Malick is one of the greats.
1.0,1001577-badlands,One of Terrence Malick's best :-)
1.0,1001577-badlands,Wow. No other words are needed.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Probabaly my favorite Malick flick
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Malick's vision is superb, from the opening scene to the closing scene it is a work of art and beautifully made. Spacek and Sheen's partnership is amazing and the film is amazing from start to finish"
1.0,1001577-badlands,"This insight into the surreal world of a psychopathic killer & his ""simple-minded"" teenage girlfriend is IMHO one of the finest films I've ever seen.It is, compelling, poetic, beautiful, haunting yet eerily unsettling on many levels.An extraordinary film."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Brilliant film, another piece of evidence that the best movies were made in the 70s"
1.0,1001577-badlands,"The most complete movie, never that and never more."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Perhaps one of the best films ever made. Its wonderfully acted and beautifully photographed but its Malick's cooly detached direction that brings all the pieces together and makes it powerful and unforgettable,"
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Once you start killin', it's hard to stop"
1.0,1001577-badlands,"""i always wanted to be a criminal, just not this big a one."""

1.0,1001577-badlands,"""Little did I realise that what began in the alleys and back ways of this quiet town would end in the Badlands of Montana"""
1.0,1001577-badlands,Bizarre and insightful.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"this is a perfect movie, great usage of sound, among everything else in this movie that is f*#@!ing incredible. if you dont like this movie, you need to put your cell phone down & watch it again."
1.0,1001577-badlands,I've been wanting to see this for years and finally got around to it. As beautiful a film about a serial killer and his underage girlfriend on a road trip as you'll ever see.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"It's aimless, directionless, remorseless nature not only serves as wonderful style, but real thoughtfulness."
1.0,1001577-badlands,This may be the strongest debut feature I've seen since CITIZEN KANE. It's perfect.
1.0,1001577-badlands,A fantastic film! Malick's debut is one of the best films of the seventies and gave us a glimpse at his future film making!
1.0,1001577-badlands,this movie was terrfic even though i just got done watching it i think that this is one of the amazing films i have ever seen so far it is my 2nd fav malick film but it amazing the netire way though martin sheen was amazing and overall this is a terrence malick masterpecie!!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Another masterpiece from the best decade for American cinema featuring amazing performances (Sissy Spacek, I'll always have a soft spot for you)."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Poetic, obscure and very watchable. The violence is brazen, very much like it would be in life, and much of the photography is unexpected. Sheen and Spacek are remarkably likable; Malick's debut comes across as the Mean Streets of the midwest, but softer."
0.0,1001577-badlands,Terrible. Nonsensical. Pretty scenery but not good.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Impossible to find a single flaw with this film. Every aspect, from the script to the cinematography, is beautiful."
1.0,1001577-badlands,Great 1959 Cadillac.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Clever account of Joe Starkweahter's '50's Dakota crime spree with that crazy Fugate girl. Marin Sheen and Sissy Spacek in their best roles.
1.0,1001577-badlands,One of the weirdest movie I've ever seen. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing! A work of art.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Great on so many levels! Terrence Malick is a force to be reckoned with.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Na falação de Malick para Cannes, resolvi assistir a obra do autor, do início; filme muito bom; em todos os aspectos;"
1.0,1001577-badlands,An interesting based on true story. Martin and Sissy rule.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Eminently watchable. Martin Sheen has a magnetic screen presence and at only 90 minutes the film is just perfect. It's also a hell of a good looking film but that goes without saying for a Terrence Malick picture.Fantastic.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"One of the most bizarre films I've ever seen, with a tone that not only has never been reproduced ever, but is almost unexplainable. There is an eerieness to the cluelessness of the two protagonists that is completely strange but totally fascinating at the same time."
1.0,1001577-badlands,Flixter users are stupid.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"An awesome movie, with beautiful cinematography, great directing, writing and acting!"
1.0,1001577-badlands,A brilliant artistic exercise but also a great crime movie with one of cinemas great narrations and some of tye moxt stunning cinematography.
1.0,1001577-badlands,A stunning cinematic experience and the best use of voice over maybe ever.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Beautiful story. I adore it.
1.0,1001577-badlands,One of my favourite films of all time. The shots used and imagery. Coupled with the Spacek's narration and Sheen's great portrayal as Kip. A must watch.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Review coming eventually?
1.0,1001577-badlands,Malick's best movie besides The Thin Red Line. Wonderful!
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Fantastic debut film by Terrance Malick. Sets the bar for couple-on-the-run films. Beautiful, quirky, and haunting."
1.0,1001577-badlands,terence malick is the shit
1.0,1001577-badlands,This is the first Sheen film i've seen but i'd go as far to say that this is likely his best role to date. Badlands is a real-life inspired film about a trigger-happy Sheen which is a very original take on the norm of serial killer features.
0.0,1001577-badlands,not much happened. meh
1.0,1001577-badlands,One of the greatest movies ever
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Sissi Spacek's voice is as sweet as a bird, Martin Sheen's actions are as scary as the devil himself."
1.0,1001577-badlands,Great movie. Sheen is cunningly likable while being psychotic. The movie rides the line of tragedy and beauty. American Beauty could be characterized as a modern equivalent of this film. Badlands is a must see.
1.0,1001577-badlands,fantastic! where has this movie been all my life?
1.0,1001577-badlands,Great film and music
1.0,1001577-badlands,Just absolutely stunning. Terence Malick's poetic visuals and career-best work from Martin Sheen. Great film.
1.0,1001577-badlands,i watched this too much
1.0,1001577-badlands,Arguably the best feature film debut EVER. The sets & cinematography are so inspired & beautiful. The performances are amazing. Even the iffy parts of the script work because they indeed make Badlands what it is.
1.0,1001577-badlands,An instant favorite!
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Una película excelente, con la música de Carl Orff ""Música Poética"", con una historia parecida a Bonny and Clyde, pero incluso más cruda. En español se llama Malas Tierras."
1.0,1001577-badlands,love every second of this classic film.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Poetry arrives at the door of the cinema...
1.0,1001577-badlands,my favourite film of all time
1.0,1001577-badlands,"""Think they'll take that into consideration?"""
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Malick is my favourite director, and this was his first film, and one of the best debuts by a director, I think. Classic American angst story of a young couple fleeing the law and the American society in the fifties midwest."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"you want this sonnabitch, take this sonnabitch."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Martin Sheen plays a guy who falls in love with a fifteen year old girl (played by Sissy Spacek) and after murdering her father, the two of them go on a cross country murder spree. I can't write anything that hasn't already been written about this fantastic film. Check it out if you get the chance."
1.0,1001577-badlands,One of the best films i've ever seen. U have to watch this movie....everyone!
1.0,1001577-badlands,This movie is as close to perfect as they come. Terence Malick made a wonderful thing here.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Best use of voice over in a film, ever."
1.0,1001577-badlands,I hope my debut can come as close to artful poetry as this film. The frames are so wide and the writing is so wonderful that this movie pushes into the realm of literature.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"What will it take to start seeing American cinema like this again? This travel narrative tears apart the fairy tale of the home, romance, and nature. Flawless!"
1.0,1001577-badlands,A quietly beautiful film. Malick's approach to following Kit and Holly without judgement is relaxing for me in an off-putting way.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"In terms of its cinematic beauty, the script's ability to maneuver through the adept usage of humor, action, romance, and suspense, it's everything that Bonnie & Clyde wished it could be, and then some."

1.0,1001577-badlands,"Historically accurate, a rare quality in American films."
1.0,1001577-badlands,Terrence Malick pulls something so new out of a story so old. You'll have to see it to make your own decisions but there is something so beautiful in the innocence of these two characters on screen that even when they do horrible things you can't help but smile.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Martin Sheen is so charming and perfect in this film, I'd let him kill me."
1.0,1001577-badlands,Tää on kyllä yks parhaita ikinä!!
1.0,1001577-badlands,"An amazing cinematic experience. Martin Sheen is great in this career defining role that pegs him as the 70s James Dean, and Sissy Spacek is even better as his naive girlfriend. Probably the most interesting couple-crime movie since Bonnie and Clyde."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"This is Malick at his best. Often copied (True Romance) but never matched. This is an American classic, not to be missed!"
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Every aspect of this movie is wonderful -- the script, the cinematography, the acting. Disturbing and likable. How does that happen?"

1.0,1001577-badlands,"how did I not review this yet? This movie's awesome - probably not quite as beautiful as Days of Heaven, but with consistently better performances and with just as potent a love story in the center of it. Few serial killer flicks are like it."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"The Best Terence Malick film. Better than ""The Days of Heaven""."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"The unique, lilting music would subsequently crop up in True Romance, though Tarantinoâ??s generation has yet to dethrone Badlands as the most haunting of all couple-on-the-run movies."
1.0,1001577-badlands,Even better on the big screen...Martin Sheen makes a great serial killer
1.0,1001577-badlands,I've pretty much watched Malick's films backwards.

1.0,1001577-badlands,"comment rendre l'horreur sublime, au delÃ  du fait divers une ode Ã  l anature comme seul terrence le grand peut en faire. Un film qui se regarde sur grand Ã©cran et qui malheureuselement (ou heureusement) ne passe pas le petit Ã©cran."
1.0,1001577-badlands,Martin Sheen's best role...that I've seen (including Apocalypse Now).My only criticism: there were a few moments where the music was kind of cheesy. I think it must have been the James Taylor contributions: generic 70's.

1.0,1001577-badlands,Gorgeous yet unsettling.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Beautifully directed, subtle acting, and STUNNING cinematography. An emotionally gripping take on the Charles Starkweather-Caril Ann Fugate killings. This is what ""Natural Born Killers"" tried to do, but FAILED."
1.0,1001577-badlands,Terrence Malick is a visual poet.
1.0,1001577-badlands,A film of cinematic poetry.
1.0,1001577-badlands,amazing film! sissy is the best!
1.0,1001577-badlands,malick appears on the scene fully formed in style. at 90~ minutes much tighter in pacing than his more recent movies which maybe heightens the juxtaposition of ambiguous visuals and revealing narration.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Still one of the greatest American films of all time.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Sheen's ""Kit"" is as much a ""walking contradiction"" as Deniro's later ""Travis Bickle"" would be, and both films are far funnier than they get credit for."

1.0,1001577-badlands,"This film is horrifying, haunting, and indescribable. If I taught film, this would be a must see. I feel like I understand a little more about everything. There are no answers in this film, just various and subtle truths about its characters."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Terrance Mallick's Empty, Yet Beautifal 'Badlands'. Fantastic."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Rich and full of deep, astounding images (as always with Malick) that will burn in your mind, and leave you haunted with dark, unanswerable questions."
1.0,1001577-badlands,The essential tragic American Romance. Voice over is very effective. Cinematography is breathtaking. Captures something quintessentially American.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"The pace is slow, which can seems strange at first for a movie about a couple running away, but it totally fits and the outstanding cinematography add a desolation atmosphere to the pessimistic storyline."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"A daring masterpiece of cinema, an update of Rebel Without a Cause for the next generation of lost souls who felt out of touch with the world."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"One of the best movies I've ever seen. Seriously. Kind of hilarious, too."
1.0,1001577-badlands,As good as an American film can aspire to be.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"The first Malick masterpiece. As ""referenced"" in Tarantino's True Romance and a thousand other films. Shocking and tender in equal measure."
1.0,1001577-badlands,Terence Malick's debut is a beautifully-shot examination of two lovers who roam the American prairie as Sheen quietly (and politely) kills people.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Spacek was around 23
1.0,1001577-badlands,"""I wish they make a Special edition DVD of this one day. One of the best movies ever made, a ladmark achivement for Terrence Malick, and a star-making performance by Martin Sheen"""
1.0,1001577-badlands,This film is beautiful.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Terry Mallick's first direction; Sissy Spacek & Martin Sheen's first film. Sparse, fast and unforgettable."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"it builds and builds like smooth molasses, then sheen hangs with the law and makes it a masterpiece. and perfect"
1.0,1001577-badlands,Just stunningly beautiful.
1.0,1001577-badlands,What a haunting and poetic film. Amazingly shot over the badlands where the sky and plains stretch on forever. A great picture. Wish Warren Oates had been used a bit more though
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Terrence Malick's debut pictures the fragility of innocence, thin line between good and evil and the haphazard nature of life. The light, the settings, the rythm and the actors are great."
1.0,1001577-badlands,This is my favorite film of all time. In my opinion its Martin Sheen at his best and Sissy Spacek is brilliant too. Its a great film!
1.0,1001577-badlands,greaaatttttttt really beautiful shots
1.0,1001577-badlands,Ooit op een nacht op televisie gezien. Terrence Malick is een echte kunstenaar. Ofwel ben je helemaal voor ofwel helemaal tegen dit soort film. Buitenaards mooie sfeer.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Just beautiful, loved the burning house shoot"
1.0,1001577-badlands,A master piece that has been homaged over and over. A pure work of genius. The cinematography serves to compliment the sublime understated performances of Martin Sheen and Sissey Spacek.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Who said that Sissy Spacek wasn't ever sexy and that treehouses weren't for adults? Martin Sheen's best performance.
1.0,1001577-badlands,"this is my favorite movie. i could maybe only watch this movie for the rest of my life. really, i only watch other movies so people think i'm a good film major"
1.0,1001577-badlands,"I just love the pace of the film, the actors, the colours..."
1.0,1001577-badlands,Absolute work of genius. One of the best debuts in filmmaking history. Sheen and Spacek shine as the killer lovers on the run.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Leccion de como hacer una buena pelicula
1.0,1001577-badlands,"A Terrence Mallick tour de force. Martin Sheen as a James Dean imitator, Sissy Spacek another quitessentially strange sociopathic teen and of course the only cameo of the director you'll ever see. A dark journey into the dark heart of America with a killing spree leading into the badlands."
1.0,1001577-badlands,One of the best American heartland films ever!!!!!!!
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Regardless of whether you're male, female, or hermaphrodite, gay, straight, or bi, you'll fantasize about *licking off every last one of Sissy Spacek's freckles.*If you're into BDSM, please read biting in place of licking."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"Gorgeous, bleak American landscapes, wonderfully photographed, provide the perfect backdrop for this tale of American morality and amorality. Sissy Spacek's vacant detachment is a perfect foil for Martin Sheen's doomed implosive rage. Best watched on a big screen, but will never disappoint."
1.0,1001577-badlands,"performances in this film are just so good, and the music makes it just wonderful to watch"
1.0,1001577-badlands,a young Martin Sheen shows that Charlie looks like a cloan of his Dad. Sissy does a great job as a naive kid who ends up on a dangerous path. Martin Sheen was and is a great lead actor. He commands your attention.
1.0,1001577-badlands,This is the movie that i watch over and over.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Aimless kids in love end up going on a murder and robbery spree in the 50s. Great performances by Sheen and Spacek on a very styled and atmospheric direction by Terrence Malick. A classic.
1.0,1001577-badlands,Terrence Malick has in his career to date only made three films. In over thirty years. However every one is worth watching and there aren't many directors you can say that about. Badlands is sublime.

1.0,1013775-metropolis,"Metropolis is one of the most important sci-fi movies ever made. It has inspired countless directors and writers and helped establish an entire genre. It survived a severe editing process, and still manages to wow me. Incredible movie even by today's standards."

1.0,1013775-metropolis,It may be a silent film but Metropolis is as exciting as any action movie. It's beautifully written and the acting is phenomenal.
1.0,1013775-metropolis,"I couldn't stop watching out of amazement. Fritz Lang's silent epic received little recognition for its achievements upon original release, which goes to show that the greatest works of art take time to be truly appreciated."
1.0,1013775-metropolis,Any words of praise I offer to this work will be insulting; it is beyond description.
1.0,1013775-metropolis,dystopian films are tricky to nail and this gets it despite being one of the earliest movies

1.0,1013775-metropolis,"Re-watched this since Infinite Jest talks about the movie a bit. Such a classic. It feels futuristic and progressive even though it's from '27. Without dialogue you can still sense all the emotions the characters are going through, and the sets look modern and refined."

1.0,1013775-metropolis,"Finally painstakingly restored after 80 years to its intended completion, Frtiz Lang's silent operatic sci-fi actioner is awe-inspiring and inspirational to movie fans. Its societal message about class divisions and the necessary evil of urbanisation still remains as urgent and relevant."

1.0,1013775-metropolis,"I had never seen the longer cut of this film, and it's a serious revelation. I liked the shorter cut well enough, but I was never crazy about it. This is almost entirely new film with entire plot lines that didn't survive the shorter cut. It's a richer film and quite the masterpiece."

1.0,1013775-metropolis,"One of the best science fiction movies ever produced. Although this film was made in 1927, it could easily be a film of today. The meaning behind this film fits together with the sensation we are living with in the world today."

1.0,1013775-metropolis,"Marvelous movie. At first I didn't like it but after the story developed I really enjoyed it. Although the acting is very dramatic. Especially from Brigitte Helm. Gustav FrÃ¶hlich looked almost exactly like Leonardo DiCaprio but it was a nice look. The plot was interesting. Too long, though."

1.0,1013775-metropolis,"I saw the complete version - gosh, I can't believe it's 1927! It's pure perfection, magnified by the fact, that it's a silent movie.

1.0,1013775-metropolis,Even though it is not my number 1 sci-fi film (only because it is hard for me to watch silent films) I can agree that Metropolis is the greatest sci-fi film of all time. Fritz Lang did things that filmmakers weren't doing till much later. You can argue that this is the greatest film of all time too.
1.0,1013775-metropolis,"One of the most visually arresting and unique movies ever made, it surprisingly still holds up. The entire movie feels like a dream. The audience doesn't notice it's a silent film for most of it."

0.0,1013775-metropolis,i felt like the most interesting thing in the movie was the music. All throughout the movie there is different types of music like fast or mysterious to show something bad is happening or about to happen. The music definetely made the movie a lot more intense.
1.0,1013775-metropolis,"Having not seen the full version I can only say it would add additional points beyond the scale. Eerie and frighteningly plausible, who's to say the future won't become this vision?"

1.0,1013775-metropolis,The work on remaking this movie while keeping the intent of the original piece was done very well.

1.0,1013775-metropolis,"For a good reason, I have never seen any other edits of Metropolis except for (luckily) the new restoration.

1.0,1013775-metropolis,"It is single handedly THE most awe-inspiring silent motion picture I have ever seen. You have to get the restored authorized version that is close to Fritz Lang's version. Tragically, some of the footage was destroyed, but they fill in the empty spaces for you."

1.0,fistful_of_dollars,"The least of the trilogy: perhaps. A perfect movie: most definitely. Though it follows the plot of another favorite movie of mine, Yojimbo by Akira Kurosawa, to the letter, ""A Fistful of Dollars"" has enough stylistic flare to make it stand on its own. This is a perfect start to a perfect series."

1.0,fistful_of_dollars,"Love westerns. This is one of my favorites. Spaghetti westerns are a special breed, they're a hit or miss. Being the first, or one of the first, of it's kind, it is the king.

0.0,star_trek_11,"All flash, no substance. More of a fan fiction than something that should be called Star Trek"
1.0,star_trek_11,FINALLY had the courage to watch this recently...Thank you cast - this is no reboot - the characters just live on - it feels so right <3 Thank you Karl Urban... A flawless McCoy :')
1.0,star_trek_11,"Perfect movie. Original, exhilarating and splendidly entertaining while also being everything Star Trek should be and a little better. Gets a bit confusing with the multiple Spock thing, but makes more sense after a rewatch. Doesn't feel like it's getting old."
0.0,star_trek_11,"I gave up on this movie due to one of its main actors, Simon John Beckingham. I am boycotting the Peggster because of his Fall 2015 New York Daily Blunder."
0.0,star_trek_11,"A very poor restart of the star trek universe, whoever thought ditching FIFTY YEARS of star trek history for this should have been fired."
0.0,star_trek_11,One of the single worst movies ever made. It is completely ruthless and thoughtless to its source material. If you like this movie your not really a Star Trek fan. This movie is terrible and only exists so that JJ Abrams could prove himself worthy of Star Wars 7 which was ok
1.0,star_trek_11,"Destiny in a foreign time and space that forges a unlikely group of fleet to band together. Why we greatly need a leader and those behing them. calculation and spontaneous decision making. Destiny we choose to follow, we understand it comes with some sacrifice."

1.0,spider_man_homecoming,Finally a Spider-Man movie that does justice to the character. Doesn't try to revisit old material from past Spider-Man movies. A young relatable Peter Parker just trying to do the right thing and become the hero he is destined to become.

0.0,spider_man_homecoming,"Worst spiderman adaption - Poor action scenes , Medicore score , Awful CGI , flat jokes , The title homecoming only represents 10 minute in the film & its more about peter parker movie than a spiderman oneEven ASM 2 is better than this shit"

1.0,1001280-assault_on_precinct_13,"Carpenter has created a whole different style, which can be classified as a low-budget movie with style. I think for his time and what he did with independent movies, including Halloween, he should go down as the most influential director ever."

1.0,1001280-assault_on_precinct_13,"This is pure cult cinema. Anyone who doubts Carpenter should see this and marvel at the way he shot LA and made it look barren and scary.

1.0,1001280-assault_on_precinct_13,"Carpenter at his best; right up there with Halloween and The Fog. The story of a gang's siege on a police station is suspenseful and tautly directed.

1.0,1001280-assault_on_precinct_13,"This has to be the most bad-ass b-grade film I've seen, with kick-ass dialogue thrown in."
1.0,1001280-assault_on_precinct_13,"A masterpiece in simmering tension and minimalist dialogue... with an excellent score to top it all off... who needs more from an ""Action"" movie?"
1.0,1001280-assault_on_precinct_13,"John carpenter's original, not the poor remake."
1.0,1001280-assault_on_precinct_13,"love this one, plenty of violence a real thriller. i never get tired of watching it"
1.0,1001280-assault_on_precinct_13,Fine work by John Carpenter. Greatly developed characters and a good plot made this movie great.
1.0,1001280-assault_on_precinct_13,"Sets up the situation convincingly with great characters. Some great scenes: the ice-cream van, and the shoot-out at the end."
1.0,1001280-assault_on_precinct_13,Is it just a coincidence that the son of God was also a Carpenter? I think not.
1.0,1001280-assault_on_precinct_13,*********** Not enough star for this one
1.0,1001280-assault_on_precinct_13,Rio Bravo in a police station versus LA street gang
1.0,1001280-assault_on_precinct_13,The original which destroys the remake in all respects.
1.0,1001280-assault_on_precinct_13,"30 years on, this original film still holds its own as a masterpiece in the action/thriller genre with its novel story, dynamic characters, and a flawless execution. SEE THIS NOW."
1.0,1001280-assault_on_precinct_13,One of those movies where the theme music chills your skin and the complexity/mystery of what's going on. My most favorite movie ever... watch it!
1.0,1001280-assault_on_precinct_13,Tense and always gripping
1.0,1001280-assault_on_precinct_13,why remake perfection? one of the most tense movies ever made
1.0,1001280-assault_on_precinct_13,"Dark, very dark and sinister, great film, really well made"
1.0,1001280-assault_on_precinct_13,"Despite being such an early effort in his directorial career, Carpenter proves easily that great filmmaking comes easily to some. Definitely one of the finest action films of all time."
1.0,1001280-assault_on_precinct_13,"The best movie John Carpenter ever made, for my money the greatest of all American films. Riveting every step of the way; Carpenter's score is hauntingly synchronized with what's on screen, which combines for one of the most most unforgettable film experiences you're likely to have."
1.0,1001280-assault_on_precinct_13,"This movie just blew me away. The score is maybe the best ever, and Carpenter is just a master."
1.0,1001280-assault_on_precinct_13,So well crafted. I love the fact that it almost never waivers from that police station scene.
1.0,1001280-assault_on_precinct_13,That opening sequence with the ice cream truck is brilliant. Top notch suspense. Much better than the remake.
1.0,1001280-assault_on_precinct_13,i could have used maybe a little bit more action but otherwise this movie is great
1.0,1001280-assault_on_precinct_13,"My first born child will be named 'Napoleon Wilson' and there first words better be ""got a smoke"" or I'm gonna ground them for the rest of their life."
1.0,1001280-assault_on_precinct_13,"Another all time fave. Stunning use of Panavision photography, minimal electronic score and wonderfully dead-pan dialogue lifted from the 40's and 50's."
1.0,1001280-assault_on_precinct_13,"Certainly one the best Action films of all time. While Assault borrows heavily from Howard Hawks' Rio Bravo and George Romero's Night of the Living Dead, it is anything but a blatant rip-off, it is a brilliant movie in it's own right."
1.0,1001280-assault_on_precinct_13,Short on budget... loaded with style... the original urban western.
1.0,1001280-assault_on_precinct_13,"Low-budget brilliance. Great charismatic characters, cool one-liners, terrifyingly blank bad guys and on of my favourite minimal scores of all time."
1.0,1046129-fugitive,"Cinema doesn't get better than this. What makes this film so great is it weaves a massively complicated web, all-the-while following the Happenstance Principle for fiction-writing: it's okay for coincidence to get you into a jam, but never okay for it to get out of it."
1.0,1046129-fugitive,"5/5. A fantastic thriller that I never get tired of watching Harrison Ford is great, but Tommy Lee Jones is incredible. If you haven't seen The Fugitive, do yourself a favor and check it out."
1.0,1046129-fugitive,"Great movie, awesome cast, excellent plot."
1.0,1046129-fugitive,Very good film! 10/10
1.0,1046129-fugitive,"This is a great film! I think the scenes like the bus train crash, the water fall scene, and more of those best scenes are a suspended twist in the story. 10/10 (Best film since Inside Out)"

1.0,1046129-fugitive,"Fast-paced, suspenseful, and totally unpredictable, watching it for the first time in ages made me realize that I had totally forgotten how exciting and great this film was.

1.0,1046129-fugitive,One of my favorites of Harrison Ford
1.0,1046129-fugitive,I always look for more humanistic qualities in a movie than i do SFX. the Fugitive is the perfect example. tommy lee jones is equally perfect as the us marshal bringing him in. The sequel was hurt only b/c it was the same movie.
1.0,1046129-fugitive,Of course the film is bolstered by its two magnetic leads but the direction and intensity puts this movie in the category of all time greats.

1.0,1046129-fugitive,This is a stunning action movie with a great cast. It had good pacing as well as action sequences and dialog. P.s. The train crash was an actual train crash!! As in they set up a coordinated crash that went out of control and could have actually killed someone!

1.0,1046129-fugitive,Harrison Ford at his best.
1.0,1046129-fugitive,Lazy police work starts this film with a point of reality that grows into a well paced chase. Harrison and Tommy complement each other well and give thorough account for their parts. The thrill and suspense continue to the end. Nibbles: Three Cheese Alfredo Mayhem.
1.0,1046129-fugitive,NEVER A DULL MOMENT . . . what with SIX EDITORS how could there be. Editing is about 90 percent of ANY film's success.

1.0,1046129-fugitive,"It's rousing, fast-paced, tense as all hell, and - most importantly - unshakable. ""The Fugitive"" is, in short, the perfect man-on-the-run thriller."
1.0,1046129-fugitive,Now this is a classic. Fine performances from both Jones and Ford as well as all of the supporting cast. This movie will never get wack. I would watch just for the part where the deputy marshall gets hit in the head with that giant pole.
1.0,1046129-fugitive,"Superb film, great storyline which set the stage for all the others"
1.0,1046129-fugitive,"The best in the ""Protagonist on the run"" sub Genre. The mystery surrounding the killer is not the main part, the way Harrison Ford runs from the law and proves his innocence is."
1.0,1046129-fugitive,Harrison is brilliant in this movie. Great storyline about a doctor who is framed for his wife's murder. He escapes from a prison van during a road accident and goes on the run to find the real killer. Great cast.
1.0,1046129-fugitive,'The Fugitive' mixes fun and fast action flick with some truly intelligent flashes of who-done-it mystery moments.
1.0,1046129-fugitive,Ford is at he's best in a role of a life time. this film doesn't let its finger of the pulse for the duration. Tommy Lee Jones is the man chasing Dr Kimble and he doesn't care what agenda he has or if he is actually innocent. this is a superb thriller that will have you glued until the conclusion.
1.0,1046129-fugitive,obsessed with it as a child
1.0,1046129-fugitive,"Amazing movie! It's the typical Harrison Ford movie, relating somehow to his family, this being no exception, being falsely accused of murdering his wife. A great movie, and never gets old, no matter how many times I see it!"

1.0,zootopia,"Há anos que não vejo a Disney fazer ""por conta"" (isto é, sem ter a Pixar como muleta) uma animação tão fantástica como essa.

1.0,zootopia,This anti-Disney Disney movie may surpass even Lilo and Stitch.
1.0,zootopia,Some people are really having to dig up some really asinine reasons to give this film a bad rating. The truth is Zootopia is the best wide release film animated or otherwise of 2016! Honestly you'd have to be a pretty cold and heartless person to watch this and feel nothing.

1.0,zootopia,"I have to say that I love great animated films perhaps more than live action great films. I don't know why. I think its because, if done right they can be so emotionally powerful, like this film, and other like it such as ""Inside Out"" and ""The Lion King"" ."

1.0,terminator,"the original,the baddest, the best."

1.0,terminator,Very good with lots of action and emotion. Best in the series because it explains everything and the Terminator does his job and shows it the best.
1.0,terminator,One of the best and well know sci-fi movies ever.
1.0,terminator,In top 10 films all time.
1.0,terminator,"Iconic. I would pay good money to see Arnie as the villain again, and no money at all to see him pregnant/twinned with an afterbirth/baby-sitting John Connor/you name it. Arnie is an emotionless Cyborg, I refuse to believe anything else!"
1.0,terminator,"ANOTHER masterpiece by James Cameron. More of a suspense thriller backed by a science fiction story, but The Terminator is a gripping start to the terminator series and gave us a redefinition of the action genre."
1.0,terminator,"a b movie with ""A"" list filmmaking"
1.0,terminator,"Love it!!! I find myself unconsciously out of breath while watching this film., The action scens are never better.,"
1.0,terminator,very freakin original.. i remember seein' it on hbo in 1984 at friends house
1.0,terminator,Supremely well paced action film that manages to be smart as well as exciting. A seminal work and prototype for the modern merging of action and science fiction. James Cameron appears to have taken many cues of Ridley's Alien.
1.0,terminator,Watching the original this morning. Not bad for 1984.
1.0,terminator,who DOESNT love time traveling murderous robots that go on to win public office???

1.0,terminator,Excellent Sci-Fi flick with strong characters and an original screenplay!

1.0,terminator,Awesome. One of the true greats of modern cinema. Thrilling and relevant all at the same time.
1.0,terminator,The most overlooked movie of all time.  The most underrated love story of all time.  The plot for this movie was written in a van.  The movie's exposition is delivered crouched in a 1980's Chevy.  Yet it is still one the most original story-lines ever conceived.  My all time personal favorite movie.
1.0,terminator,what can I say about this film apart from its fantastic and definitely deserves 5 stars
1.0,terminator,"""I'll be back,"" and he was...one too many times."

1.0,the_jungle_book_2016,"Such a special movie. Captures the fun of the animated version, tweaking a bit of the story but it's all fine. Hopefully this will excite a new generation of animal lovers and conservationists. Almost all the animals in the movie are now endangered, from the pangolin to the sloth bear."

1.0,the_jungle_book_2016,"Even though the story is the same as before, this version makes me fascinating by staring only one actor. He acts as if he plays with the real animals in the wood. Moreover, the CG is so real that sometimes I cannot distinguish."

1.0,the_jungle_book_2016,"We could not believe the top notch, ground-breaking quality of the animation, then to blend that with a terrific cast and great telling of the story makes for an excellent movie for kids of any age (I'm 69!)."

0.0,the_jungle_book_2016,Why has this been getting rave reviews? This was so boring. The voice acting on the animals by most of the cast was as if they were all phoning it in.

1.0,logan_2017,so good it should get awards!!
1.0,logan_2017,This is the best x-men movie in my opinion. Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart are terrific and Dafne Keen was great as X-23. Having an R rating helped to make this movie great. This was a great farewell to Hugh Jackman as wolverine.9.8/10

1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,A sweeping epic both in scope and execution. The visuals are sumptuous and the writing is of the highest order. Daring but subtle. Intense but never over-the-top. Contemplative but never boring. This is one of the best films ever made.
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,Perhaps the finest example of cinematography. Lean's best and one of my all time favorites.
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,The very definition of EPIC!  Wow!  Grade: A+
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,Never seen anything like it.
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,"Without a doubt, for me, the best movie ever made... and the funny thing is, there is no woman in it... well, that´s not true, I saw a nurse for about three seconds."
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,Really is one of the greatest films of all time. Fantastic epic film. Amazing cinematography.
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,This is the true definition of an epic film.
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,"There's a reason Peter O'Toole is a legend, and this is it."
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,"Truly, truly great epic."
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,"I shall watch Orance of Arabia again, but it's length makes that hard to do in one sitting. On the other hand, it's amazing that such a long film is able to captivate and truly entertain you throughout it's duration."
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,One of the best movies of all time.
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,"Great movie, one of the best epic ever to grace the screen. Lawrence's growth on screen keeps the audience occupied , his humor, grief, horrendous acts and others make him more human and still a legend."
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,"As an aspiring filmmaker, film historian and film critic, Lawrence of Arabia is the greatest film ever made. Grade; A+ + + +"
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,"This is one amazing film, and the people who gave it negative reviews and calling it overrated should get eaten by a T-rex because they don't realize the epicness of this movie."
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,"The greatest epic film to date, David Lean creates a cautivating and magical tale that stands the test of time, featuring fantastic performances from all of its cast, especially from Peter O'Tool and Omar Shariff. My appreciation to this film is 97/100, rounded to 100."
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,In my top three movies (and I forget what the other two are!)
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,The second greatest film ever made and the best Epic.
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,"An true epic. From the stunning cinematography to Peter O'Toole's great performance to the fantastic story, Lawrence of Arabia excels in every aspect. The only problem is the length, though it fills every second of that time with something amazing. An awe inspiring film."
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,"One of the most influential, epic, moving, and understanding war films that I have ever seen. It shows the value of innocence and how war will tear that innocence apart so easily. This is one of the best films ever to be made."
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,"The film that David Lean and Peter O'Tool will no doubt be remembered for; it's a mysterious wonder that doesn't grow dated, and treats the protagonist as a human, instead of a contemporary movie hero."
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,I thought sharif Ali was hot when I was 11 :D
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,One of the best films ever made. It's an amazing work of art.
1.0,ran,"There are no words to describe how you feel the moment this film ends. It ranks along with Apocalypse Now, Lawrence of Arabia, The Godfather: Part II and 2001: A Space Odyssey as one of the top 5 greatest films ever made, in my humble opinion."
1.0,ran,RAN is a miraculous film made by one of the best filmmakers of all time. How someone in their 70's could make such an epic take on King Lear is beyond me. It is perhaps Kurosawa's last great film in the Japanese period drama genre- a genre of films he had no equals in.
1.0,ran,One of the best films ever made
1.0,ran,??????4K???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????...??????????????????????????????
1.0,ran,Kurosawa's best work.
1.0,ran,5 Stars. Another masterpiece. Kurosawa just gets it.
1.0,ran,"I'm ashamed that it took me this long to finally see this in its entirety. Obviously masterful direction (such magnificent compositions and camera movement! Such superb sound cues!) aside, what strikes me the most about this is the theme of karma. Karma is a real bitch, and you reap what you sow."
1.0,ran,Kuro Sawa San! See I did go idiot Chris!
1.0,ran,"This one is #4 on my all-time list and just saw a 4k Digital restoration of it in theatres, what an experience. Such a masterful film, but seeing it on the big screen with an enthusiastic audience was truly special. If you've never seen it, then run, don't walk, to check it out!"
1.0,ran,A beautiful feat of terrible and raw tragic power. Ran is simply an amazing movie that transcends description.
1.0,ran,A masterpiece to put it mildly.
1.0,ran,"A (literal) Shakespearean masterpiece, Akira Kurosawa's Ran is a dazzlingly rich, beautifully staged update of a classic fable"
1.0,ran,"Akira Kurosawa's ""Ran"" is my favorite movie of all time. I could go on about why this film is so fantastic in every way, but I'll just leave it at GO WATCH THIS MOVIE RIGHT NOW."
1.0,ran,The greatest fight sequence in the history of cinema.One of my top five favorite movies and just another wonderful notch in a long glorious movie belt for Kurosawa.
1.0,ran,"Another Kurosawa film that speaks no less of his undeniable mastery over both the samurai period film and over cinema in general. The usual perfection is there - the solid acting, excellent cinematography, strokes of meaningful colour, broad set pieces, and all the more heartfelt and pure emotion."
1.0,ran,one of the top ten films ever made.
1.0,ran,"Kurosawa's final masterpiece just might be his best, in a beautifully shot and compelling epic chronically the chaos of one's decent into madness that would make The Bard very proud."
1.0,ran,"In a mad world, only the mad are sane."
0.0,ran,"The most boring Japanese film I've ever seen. It's a period drama about a family fewd which goes on and on and doesn't seem to ever end. It is lauded as a must-see but I really don't know why, I was bored out of my skull."
1.0,ran,One of the many masterpieces of the brilliant Akira Kurosawa.
1.0,ran,"Japanese version of Shakespeare's King Lear. A great film! In a mad world, only the mad are sane. Heaven is far away but hell can be reached in a day."
1.0,ran,Powerful and sublime. Truly a remarkable film. I was mesmerized from the start.
1.0,ran,A flawless retelling of Shakespeare King Lear
1.0,ran,"Mr. Kurosawa is a master of merging the epic scale with the meticulous details, the majestic backdrops with the puny humans within it. With Ran, the result is a must-see for lovers of battle films, period films, or cinema as a whole."
1.0,ran,"An epic film with some of the most greatest battle scenes, characters, and visual shots. It's a superb film adaptation of Shakespeare's King Lear."
1.0,ran,Just another reason Kurosawa continues to reign as my favorite director. So few people can make films this epic and this intimate. Plus it has one of the best uses of color in film history.
1.0,ran,Pince obra de arte otro pedo!!
1.0,ran,"One of the best movies ever made, based on King Lear's Shakespeare and made by the genius Kurosawa = a long masterpiece. YOU GOTTA LOVE IT!"
1.0,ran,"""Ran"" is an epic, gorgeous film. It boasts excellent settings and hues, especially during the battle scenes. I need to see it again."
1.0,ran,29/30. It's so satisfying to finally watch a film about nothing.
1.0,ran,"Impeccable film making from a certified genius in film making.....a little confusing at times, but I could not take my eyes off of it......."
1.0,ran,"King Lear on steroids, a solid look at loyalty, my favorite samurai film, and my favorite film of all time."
1.0,ran,"Incredibly epic and also humorous, although not sure the later is intentional."
1.0,ran,One of my favorite movie of all times.
1.0,ran,Watched before 7/5/2012
1.0,ran,One of the best epics by one of the best filmmakers in cinema history! Good luck trying to shake this one once it's finished! Fucking masterpiece!
1.0,ran,One of Akira Kurosawa's best films .=)
1.0,ran,"The last thing I'd ever expect Kurosawa to do is outdo ""Seven Samurai,"" but he comes damn near close here."
1.0,ran,I love this Movie! it's just stunning to look at!
1.0,ran,this is like the best kurosawa's movie ever! not a single flaw can be found! a superb performance from tatsuya nakadai AS USUAL! who could ever forget the ending and the scenes where the castle burnt to the ground??
1.0,ran,The Japanese King Lear!
1.0,ran,The swirl of human lives is always a beautiful disaster...
1.0,ran,Ran is pure film magic. Akira Kurosawa is a virtuoso unlike any other!
1.0,ran,"This film defines the word epic in every way. characters, story, soundtrack, omg soundtrack! ambition, cinematography (best I've seen), editing I'm pretty sure I can go on but if you're not watching it right now you probably never will, and what a shame that will be."
1.0,ran,Kurosawa deserved an Oscar for Direction. He was nominated in this category. Injustice!
1.0,ran,"What to say, nothing to say just an absolute Masterpiece, beyond epic"
1.0,ran,???? ????? ???. ?? ????? ?????? ??? ???? ???? ???. one of my top 5
1.0,ran,"King Lear, but with samurai. Nuff said."
1.0,ran,I just saw it! It was great!!
1.0,ran,EPIC and just plain beautiful to watch!! I love Akira Kurosawa!!
1.0,ran,I thought it was just another prodigal son story. I was wrong. Epic movie is epic!
1.0,ran,What an epic battle. This film is so good. Kurosawa is the master of Japanese film.
1.0,ran,"Kurosawa's greatest film, and my personal favorite when I was in high school and liked PRETTY COLORS AND BLOOD."
1.0,ran,"It has been said before, but I would like to reiterate: if Shakespeare made films chances are they would look like Ran. Kurosawa proves that he could still direct films well into his eighties and still obilterate the competition."
1.0,ran,What a drag it is getting old.
1.0,ran,First time I saw it I wasn't crazy about it. I just watched it again and loved it. One of the most intense movies I've seen in a long time.
1.0,ran,A spectacular battle epic
1.0,ran,This is why Kurosawa is one of cinema's greats.
1.0,ran,One of the best war movies ever made.
1.0,ran,potentially the most stunningly brilliant movie ever made.
1.0,ran,"Wow, what a movie. I love Japan, it's culture and Japanese. This is a great movie from Japan's best directors Kurosawa. I also love the fact it's an historical movie."
1.0,ran,"""For aficionados of the war movie, the western, and the period action epic, Ran is necessary viewing."" Amy Taublin"
1.0,ran,One of Kurosawa's best
1.0,ran,Akira Kurosawa directed Ran with the same insatiable bloodlust comparable to that of Lord Hidertora's raging sons.
1.0,ran,"Best movie I have seen recently, dark, intense, philosophical, good story and good visual."
1.0,ran,"Kurosawa's interpretation of Shakespeare's King Lear through the prism of Imperial Japan, is one of the great masterpieces of world cinema..."
1.0,ran,"Superb inspiration of King Lear at the hands of a true filmmaking genius. Akira Kurosawa, you deserve a bow. Tragic epic told with as less cheesiness as possible."
1.0,ran,five stars just for the scenery
1.0,ran,Again..Akira Kurosawa...perfect
1.0,ran,"Akira Kurosawa adapts King Lear into a Japanese feudal era piece flawlessly. The Cinematography, and scale of the production design alone solidify the film as a cinematic landmark. Ran will mesmerize it's audience not only as an epic war film, but also as a ironic and engrossing morality play."
1.0,ran,One of the best Shakespeare adaptations ever!!
1.0,ran,"A classic of Japanese cinema. If you haven't watched it, do yourself a favor."
1.0,ran,"Classic epic from every level. Cinematography, music score, costume design, clever performaces, and the battle scenes. The director's re-done ideas of King Lear is as great as you expect. Slow-paced, picking up after the first hour, and then came the heartbreaking ending."
1.0,ran,One of the most epic films I've ever scene. This may currently be my favorite film!
1.0,ran,Terrific film. Possibly Kurosawa's finest film.
1.0,ran,There's nothing I have to say that hasn't been said by the consensus.
1.0,ran,"Kurosawa's interpretation of Shakespeare's King Lear through the prism of Imperial Japan, is one of the great masterpieces of world cinema..."
1.0,ran,This movie is a work of art.
1.0,ran,This movie has some of the best acting in japanese film i've ever seen. Its great i love the beginning when the father gets pissed off at his youngest son
1.0,ran,"Watching an old evil lose its head and find redemption and meaning in the most unlikely of sources, what a watch this is."
1.0,ran,This movie is going to ruin my whole day... but it was excellent
1.0,ran,Kurosawa`s last great movie!
1.0,ran,"By far the best film of Asian cinema! Being new to Akira Kurosawa, i'd love to see more of his films!"
1.0,ran,Love Akira Kurosawa movies..
1.0,ran,"One of the most beautifully filmed films, ever."
1.0,ran,"King Lear in fudeal Japan? What more could anyone need? Not much, I'd say. Kurosawa manages to find a sombre beauty in tragedy and existential crisis. This film is nothing short of astounding."
1.0,ran,"Both grand and intimate. This movie is a colorful, emotional epic that ranks up there with Seven Samurai."
1.0,ran,epic film I loved the colors
1.0,ran,"A nation is a beating heart. And it can be torn asunder.I now realize several dictators have never read Shakespeare or seen Kurosawa's films, explains ALOT.""Those who fail to learn from the past..."""
1.0,ran,Kurosawa's greatest achievement...a pure masterpiece
1.0,ran,amazingly well made epic.
1.0,ran,The best Kurosawa I saw so far! No character is shallow and most of them could have a movie on their own.
1.0,ran,One of the most compelling movies i've ever seen. Excellent in every possible way.
1.0,ran,"It took me 26 years to watch it, to my shame. Kurosawa's epic masterpiece - based on King Lear - is a monument in its own right. A stylishly designed, dark-hearted lesson in the tragical realism that the human condition so often descends into."
1.0,ran,One of Kurosawa's greatest achievements.
1.0,ran,King Lear with Samurais...
1.0,ran,"""Only the birds and the beasts live in solitude."""
1.0,ran,"The massive scale, amount of planning, direction, and coordination that went into this film makes epics like Lord of the Rings look fat and lazy."
1.0,ran,"Kurosawa's ostentatious Shakespearean masterpiece wields vibrant colors, a visceral musical score, extravagant set pieces, and overwhelming epic battles. Despite that, it seemed Kurosawa butchered Shakespeare's play. 98/100"
1.0,ran,Nothing short of an epic and one of Kurosawa's last great work and nothing short of it. I liked just about everything and thats what makes it amazing.
1.0,ran,again I got a VHS copy of this before but now where can I find a copy?
1.0,ran,very long and just beautiful. no words can describe this large scale epic. this is Kurosawa's last great work.
1.0,ran,Het grandiose epos van Akira Kurosawa dat 'King Lear' vertaalt naar het 16de eeuwse Japan. Een meesterwerk en klassieker die je als zelfrespecterende filmfan moet gezien hebben!
1.0,ran,"Sprawling, ambitious, and beautifully shot, Akira Kurosawa's Ran is a marvelous film that showcases Kurosawa's skill for complementing narrative with visuals. The last shot of the film is incredible."
1.0,ran,Kurosawa strikes again with another hari-kari filled samurai flick shot in colour! Superb.
1.0,ran,Kenneth Branaugh eat your heart out. Now THIS is how you adapt Shakespeare
1.0,ran,One of the finest films ever made.
1.0,ran,"For Kurosawa to turn in such a stunning achievement while in his 80s and struggling to find funding and a market in his own country is quite a feat. Kurosawa made plenty of pictures with personality, but none moreso than Ran."
1.0,ran,"A fitting ""end"" to a great director's career that is a classic in of its self."
1.0,ran,"Ran proves that even near the end of his life, Akira Kurosawa will always be one of the greatest directors who ever lived."
1.0,ran,"The thing with Akira Kurosawa's films is to me he's flawless. This is scientific proof of that considering he was over 70 when he made this tale of karma. Lord Hidertora Ichimonji is ruthless, cold, and sadistic. Watch it yourself. Take my word."
1.0,ran,"flexor!!! from rashorom to ran, akira kurosawa never let us disapointed! akira forver!"
1.0,ran,"So fuckin cool. Excellent cinematography, excellent story."
1.0,ran,"in a mad world, only the mad are sane!"
1.0,ran,Kurosawa three of top-ten! Japanese version of King Lear...
0.0,ran,Overrated. Dont know how its in IMDB top 250
1.0,ran,"Epic, beautifully stylish, tragic and disciplined."
1.0,ran,Watching Ran on the big screen is a movie-going experience akin to seeing Lawrence of Arabia in 70 MM. A beautiful and tragic movie.
1.0,ran,"Maybe the best cinematic treatment of Shakespeare (along with Branaugh's HAMLET), with dazzling cinematography and some of the greatest battle sequences ever filmed. Must viewing for anyone not afraid of subtitles."
1.0,ran,This is an exquisite piece of cinema. Shakespeare and Kurosawa make an unbeatable team. See this movie.
1.0,ran,I just saw this at the Belcourt Theater in Nashville and it was AMAZING!
1.0,ran,"another great Kurosawa film, another vision of a great shakesphere play told through his point of view. Like ""Throne of Blood"", Ran is a film that takes Shakesphere vision, translated them into Japanese history, but manges to keep the universal themes."
1.0,ran,Best tragic film ever. More analysis later.
1.0,ran,One of Kurosawa's best
1.0,ran,Kurosawa = Stunning achievement in epic cinema. and in Color!
1.0,ran,"Mieko Harada is creppy and evil as Lady Kaede. The sweep of the ""King Lear"" story is ever sprialling downward. The visuals are striking and gruesome and beautiful. A wonderful film."
1.0,ran,A masterpiece. Epic battles with thousands of extras makes them even more spectacular. Just perfection.
1.0,ran,A Giant Samurai Epic based on Shakespeare's King Lear with great Battles and Natur Shots grandious directed by the Master Akira Kurosawa a tragic Masterpiece about Trust and Mistrust
1.0,ran,Gorgeous masterpiece.
1.0,ran,"This is a masterful and almost perfect visualision and dramatisation of a story thay anyone has ever commited to a film reel, in my opinion. Kurosawa, the master of cinema."
1.0,ran,"Ran is slightly marred by some too obvious straining toward masterpiece status, yet it's a stunning achievement in epic cinema. Working on a large scale seems to bring out the best in Kurosawa's essentially formal talents."
1.0,ran,"One of the, if not the, best film ever!"
1.0,ran,One of the greatest films ever
1.0,ran,"A Tragedy stained with blood, soaked in Cinema"
1.0,ran,saw this years ago as an undergrad. it was incredible! would live to watch it again
1.0,ran,just... amazing. Kurosawa is definitely the greatest of all time.
1.0,ran,Akira Kurosawa's last epic is every bit as brilliant as his early epics.
1.0,ran,"For what can be considered to be Akira Kurosawa's final epic, I honestly can't think of a better way to go out. Visually awe-inspiring. I haven't seen a movie that looks this great in years. As far as I'm concerned, this movie is as close to feudal Japan as modern man can get."
1.0,ran,"A true tragedy, to be sure, but one that always manages to get me in a tremendously deep way. By far my favorite film of Kurosawa's."
1.0,ran,This may well be the best epic film ever made. It's certainly amongst the best I have ever seen.
1.0,ran,"Beautifully filmed and the battle scenes are stunning. Movies like this (Braveheart, Kingdom of Heaven, Troy) are either great or bad in my opinion. Kurosawa never made a bad war film, or a bad film at all really. Check it out if you don't mind subtitles and long takes."
1.0,ran,Perhaps the best Shakespearian adaptation of all time by the cinematic master Akira Kurosawa.
1.0,ran,"I know this has become a cliche saying among movie critics and others. But its so true, nobody could shoot a battle scene like Akira Kurosawa did."
1.0,ran,"Shichinin no Samurai this, Seven Samurai that, and blablabla, yes ppl may say Shichinin no Samurai aka Seven Samurai is Kurosawa's best effort, but this is without doubt my favorite from him ! (and just fyi, i love Seven Samurai, gave it 4 1/2 stars and also in my top 100)"
1.0,ran,A true masterpiece by Kurosawa. The battle sequences were made to look like a ballet on a Sunday night. Truly profound and beautiful.
1.0,ran,"The first movie to have made me cry.I don't cry often.Not when my dog died, not when grandparents pass.This made me cry."
1.0,ran,excellent movie. good job akira
1.0,ran,Kurosawa is infallible. Great take on King Lear. Awesome use of color and scenery.
1.0,ran,Fantastic Epic. The most beautiful opening landscape scenes!
1.0,ran,"One of many Kurosawa movies that is absolutely riddled with amazing costumes and Characters. ""I am lost."" - ""Such is the human condition."""
1.0,ran,"A fantastic adaptation of ""King Lear."" Epic in proportion and brilliantly acted."
1.0,ran,"""Man is born crying. When he has cried enough, he dies."""
1.0,ran,A pure masterpiece. It takes a overdone genre ?samurai films? and pushes the limits. Using Shakespeare as a foundation and building the story into an epic tale of betrayal. This movie has inspired so many filmmakers it should never be ignored.
1.0,ran,Totally breathtaking!
1.0,ran,"Overwhelming and magnificent visual style, resonant and poetic, dynamic, painterly composition and striking, expressionistic color. Mieko Harada is flawlessly ruthless as the vengeful Lady Kaede. The last and greatest masterwork by Akira Kurosawa."
1.0,ran,"Quand Kurosawa se met à la couleur, ça donne un tableau à chaque plan. Un chef-d'oeuvre digne des plus grandes tragédies grecques."
1.0,ran,King Lear in Japan. My favorite Kurosawa and the best King Lear adaptation I have seen. The absence of sound in the battle sequences is haunting.
1.0,ran,A masterpiece by Kurosawa. Easily one of the greatest film adaptations of Shakespeare in history.
1.0,ran,"Very dark existentialist film, one that I identify with very much. Some of the best war scenes ever filmed. Cinematic perfection."
1.0,ran,"The brilliant Japanese director Akira Kurosawa's take on William Shakespeare's KING LEAR is nothing short of stunning. Unforgettable imagery and characters abound in this beautiful work of art. The first viewing may be a bit difficult, but repeat viewings are a joy."
1.0,ran,"I'm pretty sure that this was Kirosawa's first film in technicolor, and it has that stunning colorful beauty of early technicolor films. The acting is great, and the direction is ahead of its time, as with most of Kirosawa's movies."
1.0,ran,"I absolutely love this movie. The first time I rented it from Netflix, I actually watched it twice the same night! Heart-wrenching but wonderful!"
1.0,ran,"I love how colors. Nice, but violent."
1.0,ran,"Undesputably the best battlefield movie merging grand picturesque, Japanese culture, powerful drama and cross reference with Shakespeare's ""King Lear"" by artistic shoting and mastery in directing. Hats off to Akira Kurosawa!"
1.0,ran,The Japanese version of King Lear done many times better. I love that time and moments are savoured in this film. The gorgeous cinematography is really a treat.
1.0,ran,Breathtakingly brilliant.
1.0,ran,Best Movie based on Shakespeare ever totally stunning
1.0,ran,"High tragedy on an epic scale. Gorgeous, lush cinematography. (Those beautiful grassy hills!)"
1.0,ran,Brillant. Tout simplement.
1.0,ran,Extraordinary. Excellent acting. Extremely moving and 3 hours doesn't seem long enough. Mmm.
1.0,ran,Oustanding transfer of King Lear to a samurai epic; interesting choice of long shot photography by Kurosawa.
1.0,ran,"This is by far the best Shakespeare adaptation ever shot on film, and maybe even the best film ever made -- but this is only my humble opinion, of course."
1.0,ran,man crave epic movie. it just can get as epic as this story of shogun who earned everything and lost it all at his final days to a woman full of scorn.
1.0,ran,One of the greatest movies ever made. Possibly Tatsuya Nakadai's greatest role.
1.0,ran,Simply one of the best.
1.0,ran,rarely watch something more beautifull and powerfull on a silver screen
1.0,ran,A true spectacle of cinema. If you can find the time watch it.
1.0,ran,Another bloody film that I surprsingly enjoyed. Hail to Akira Kurosawa.
1.0,ran,Kurasawa's King Lear -- and his masterpiece.
1.0,ran,Kurosawas best movie and probably one of the best movies ever made.
1.0,ran,"""Ran"" must surely be Kurosawa's masterpiece. Mieko Harada is extraordinary,and the settings are simply stunning."
1.0,ran,Excelente filme que la nueva generación no logra apreciar. Ja.
1.0,ran,"Incredible. Costumes, cinematography, direction are all just unbelievable. It makes we wonder what Seven Samurai and other epic Kurosawa would look like in color."
1.0,ran,As near perfect as a film can get.
1.0,ran,"The oldest hath borne most: we that are young,Shall never see so much, nor live so long."
1.0,ran,"I had been meaning to see this for a long time. I thouroughly enjoyed it, it is not as some people think a direct adaptation of King Lear. Yet again another excellent Kurosawa film."
1.0,ran,One of Kurosawa's best in a long career of brilliant films.
1.0,ran,epic. beautiful film by Kirosawa. they don't make films like this anymore.
1.0,ran,one of his best movies!!!
1.0,ran,Superb! Akira Kurosawa didn't fail us. Ran is a breathtaking masterpiece which everyone should watch.
1.0,ran,Kurosawa's last epic is probably the most beautiful of all is films. His direction is impeccable.
1.0,ran,"This movie is a pure EPIC. The scope: EPICThe acting: EPICThe setting: EPICThe story: EPICKurosawa pulled out all the stops for this one, and does not disappoint."
1.0,ran,Kurosawa's portrayal of insanity is one of the bests in cinema.
1.0,ran,What can I say? This man has not made a bad movie (at least with the ones that I have seen). But the story is absolutely amazing and fucked up as well but it is just an amazing piece of cinema. This is a must see. Very well done.
1.0,ran,One of my favourite movies of all times.
1.0,ran,"Based on King Lear, an artistic masterpiece. Kurosawa's best."
1.0,ran,"Wow, wow, and wow. 2 hours and 40 minutes flew by. Great movie all around."
1.0,ran,"Wonderful film. (I should note that it was not released in 2000, but in 1985.)"
1.0,ran,Let's put it this way. Shakespeare was history's greatest playwright. Lear was his greatest play. Kurosawa improved upon it. Nuff said.
1.0,ran,Makes everything else look cheap.
1.0,ran,one hell of a bleak picture. so intense and beautiful (in a very ugly way)one of kurosawa's best.
1.0,ran,YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOSH
1.0,ran,"It's fucking Kurosawa, how can it NOT be good?"
1.0,ran,It could only be better if they added ninjas.
1.0,ran,Great adaptation of King Lear.
1.0,ran,Quite simply a masterpiece!
1.0,ran,The performance of actors were very good and the score was excellent. The cinematography was marvelous and the way Kurosawa brought out the colors was just in a genius way. This film is a color masterpiece by Kurosawa.
1.0,ran,Kurosawa is genious.
1.0,ran,"scenery, score, everything was absolutely amazing. it seemed real, until the hyper real blood took hold of the scene. but ti was strong on the connection and emotional portrayal of the characters."
1.0,ran,"Akira Kurosawa's sweeping period piece. The word ""epic"" gets tossed around alot these days, and most of the people who use the word, in regard to film, have no idea what the true meaning of the word is. This film is ""epic"". ""300"" is not!!!"
1.0,ran,"I'm not a huge fan of the story (ie Shakespeare's macbeth), the color, cinematography, emotion, and artistry are truly special.. if it is on story, i prefer his movie seppaku"
1.0,ran,Simply put: a must-see.
1.0,ran,Who would have thought that carnage could be beautiful?
1.0,ran,Another legendary movie.
1.0,ran,I only like Shakespeare when Kurosawa does it
1.0,ran,"This is my favorite Kurosawa film, which is saying a lot considering I love every single movie Kurosawa directed (yes, even Dreams)"
1.0,ran,"highly recommended Shakespearean adaptation by ""Seven Samurai"" famed Akira Kurosawa. an epic story of deathly family relations that shape the lands and sear them with flame."
1.0,ran,Kurosawa is perfection
1.0,ran,"Interesting that it took Japanese film master Kurosawa to make the best screen version of KING LEAR, transforming it into a samurai epic. Grand entertainment."
1.0,ran,Great Film can not add anything that has not been said before or better
1.0,ran,What can anyone say about Kurosawa? Absolutely amazing! Yet another interpretation of Shakespeare that I hasten to say may be better than the original.
1.0,ran,"Perfect. At least as epic as the source material, possibly more so."
1.0,ran,"Truly a masterpiece. Kurosawa reverts to an incredibly simplistic way of shooting a movie, yet that gives the story so much more weight, which is how it should be with Shakespeare. Kurosawa is a master, if all his other films didn't prove that, then Ran certainly sets it in stone."
1.0,ran,The greatest Shakespeare adaptation ever!
1.0,ran,Kurosawa at his very best!
1.0,ran,Il ricordo di una notte insonne passata ad ammirare un grandissimo film!
1.0,ran,So powerful I was literally awed. A masterpiece.
1.0,ran,My favorite Kurosawa movie. And that's saying a lot. Right up there with my favorites of all time. There is no way this movie could have been better. Perfect.
1.0,ran,"A masterful reimaging of ""King Lear"" and possibly my favorite Kurosawa movie of all time. Colorful, beautifully shot, and well-acted."
1.0,ran,King Lear set in Japan
1.0,ran,"Un monumento de peli­cula. Adaptacion japonesa de la obra de Shakespeare ""King Lear"". Cada detalle del filme es arte."
1.0,ran,"Kurosava gives perfectly in Japan the "" king Lear """
1.0,ran,"An epic masterpiece if there ever was one. I cannot find fault with a single aspect of this film. Like Shakespeare's tragedy, Kurosawa's tale is so beautifully dreary in tone, complemented perfectly by the picturesque imagery. If I could, I would frame every shot on a bare, boundless wall."
1.0,ran,amazing film that i think everyone should see
1.0,ran,Best Shakespeare adaptation ever.
1.0,ran,"Shakespeare and Samurai by Kurosawa, in color this time! A great movie, but you have to be prepared for the stylized Japanese approach to acting."
1.0,ran,"Kurosawa does Shakespeare, is there anything he CAN'T do? One of those films I have to call a masterwork."
1.0,ran,"kurosawa's take on king lear. you will feel the pain and sorrow here. you will ask yourself, why do we live amidst such pain and death?"
1.0,ran,"Huge, epic, and utterly brilliant. A true Kurosawa classic, the kind of film you will never see made again."
1.0,ran,"A stunning masterpiece of Japanese cinematography, Kurosawa-san seamlessly blends the romanticism of both feudal Japan and a true Shakespearean classic. This is one of my favorite movies of all time!"
1.0,ran,"Japanese King Lear. Great movie, great shots."
1.0,ran,A classic in my collection
1.0,ran,"Kurasawa's last movie was him at his best. More than King Lear, its predominantly pessimistic and dark tone contrasts starkly from some of Kurosawa's more impetuous movies. It is an epic delivered with strong theatrical and thematic elements."
1.0,ran,"My favorite film directed by Kurosawa (along with ""Ikiru""), this is the Japanese samurai version of King Lear. It should come to no surprise then that this is one depressing movie."
1.0,ran,"If Lawrence of Arabia is one man's epic, Ran is mankind's. Transcends culture. Kear Lear from The Master of narrative film."
1.0,ran,"Not a movie I can just watch any old day (long, and slow paced at times), but still perhaps my favourite from Kurosawa (or anybody else)."
1.0,ran,This movie made both Shakespeare and Japanese Cinema click for me. I owe much of the rest of my movie watching life to its greatness. -Ryan
1.0,ran,"Ran is Kurosawa at his best; brilliantly filmed on a grand scale. Kurosawa has an amazing ability to chronicle the faults of mankind in ways that are incredibly simple, yet powerful."
1.0,ran,"Great version of Samurai/Lear/Shakespeare, totally tragic and stunning realisation that God cries for man's injustice to man. Kurasawa outdid even himself here going beyond the culture to man's core essence. Beautiful to look at as a movie should be."
1.0,ran,this is like the best kurosawa's movie ever! not a single flaw can be found! a superb performance from tatsuya nakadai AS USUAL! who could ever forget the ending and the scenes where the castle burnt to the ground??
0.0,ran,"A legendary work of epic cinematic genius? Maybe, but I think it's fuck boring and have decided never to endure a Kurosawa movie ever again..."
1.0,ran,Perfect... anything else I say would just diminish this master piece.
1.0,ran,"Possibly one the best EVER. Kurosawa's direction, spotless. Shakespeare's storyline and charactes, awesome. Dialogues gracefully toned down. Acting, superb."
1.0,ran,Two towering masters meet: Shakespeare and Kurosawa
1.0,ran,It is the Grand Masterpiece of Akira Kurosawa.
1.0,ran,King Lear in Japanese. Beautiful beautiful cinematography (omg the battles) with great characters. Possibly the best epic tragedy I've seen.
1.0,ran,this movie is beautiful
1.0,ran,"Stunning! The battle sequences are drama and tragedy mixed with spectacle and lyricism. The whole film is beautifully made, with the tragedy of King Lear (on which it is based) and then some!"
1.0,ran,"This was an amazing film. The cinematography, the costumes, the script... I can see why it was nominated and won so many awards. The ending was very depressing and oh so Shakespearian. I recommend it to all.Btw, the trailer doesn't do this film justice."
1.0,ran,Akira Kurosawa is genious! Brilliant movie.
1.0,ran,fantastic! i especially love the colors and the banners and the crazy makeup on the father
1.0,ran,"If you sit down to see RAN, be prepared for a jaw-dropping experience. Akira Kurosawa-Shakespeare of the Japanese Film industry."
1.0,ran,"Kurosawa's ""painting on film"". possibly the most beautiful film (in colour and scope) ever made."
1.0,ran,"Overwhelming in its portrait of human blindness, consequence, and regret, ""Ran"" is a visual meditation that never stops giving, with moments of painterly beauty juxtaposed with terrible moments of violence. The haunting music cues in the large-scale battles will knock you on the floor."
1.0,ran,"One of the last movies made by the legendary Akira Kurosawa. Being almost completely blind when making ""Ran"", the crew had to rely on paintings Kurosawa had made to make this adaptation of Shakespeare's ""King Lear""."
1.0,ran,"The crowning achievement of a legendary career, it's a masterpiece on every level. One of the few adaptations of Shakespeare's works that lives up to the original as a work of art."
1.0,ran,Kurosawa was a painter too... it shows
1.0,ran,"Excelente adaptación del Rey Lear en manos de Kurosawa. La mejor dirección de arte que he visto, está en esta película."
1.0,ran,"With ""Ran"", Kurosawa takes the greatest play ever written to a whole new level and the end result is unbelievable."
1.0,ran,"Excllent very cool. A character driven epic full of loyalty, betrail, friendship and action. The battle scenes especially highlight the epic nature of the film as well as being historical acurate."
1.0,ran,"This film gets a wrap for holding a very depressing world view. Everything made sense though, power over family, suffering over religious sanctuary, etc. Seemed realistic in that vein..."
1.0,ran,"Another great from Kurosawa and one of the best retellings of ""King Lear""."
1.0,ran,"kurosawa's quickly becoming one of my favorite directors. it's absolutely thrilling to see him retell shakespeare's ""king lear"" in a way that stays faithful to the original while still leaving his unmistakable stamp on it."
1.0,ran,Kurosawa's last masterpiece.
1.0,ran,Kurosawa's last masterpiece.
1.0,ran,If you do not see this movie then you have no soul.
1.0,ran,"Drama épico dirigido por el inigualable Akira Kurosawa. Narra la historia del clan Hidetori, basado en una obra de William Shakespeare."
1.0,ran,Epic and one of the best adaptations of King Lear ever.
1.0,ran,"Another stellar performance from Kurasawa, at times the movie was hard to folow, but it was still very well done. Also was shot beautifully which you come to expect from his movies."
1.0,ran,Kurosawa doing what he does best!!!
1.0,ran,"epic, almost grandiose, but intimate and visually lyrical"
1.0,ran,Another favorite. The single most beautifully shot film ever made.
1.0,ran,"even though i've never actually read ""king lear"" i thought that the story was executed amazingly well. it's gripping and the japanese setting made it all the more spectacular. my favorite characters were hidetora dono and kaede sama. ^w^"
1.0,ran,"Facebook provides too small a space to do justice to a movie like this, so I'll just say that it has one of the most beautiful final images I've ever seen in a movie, right up there with Nostalghia."
1.0,ran,"Kurosawa has a tendency to drag it out, but this adaptation of the Shakespearian tragedy deserves it. A great film to watch despite its length and subtitles (unless, of course, you speak nihongo)."
1.0,ran,All-time-favoritt. Best-asian-movie....EVER!
1.0,ran,This may well be the best epic film ever made. It's certainly the best I have ever seen.
1.0,ran,I was becoming more and more emotionally attached to this movie as I was watching it.. definitely one of his best! I wonder how it would have been with Mifune.
1.0,ran,"Un tres tres grand film, pour un des plus grands realisateurs que la terre n'ai jamais portee!"
1.0,ran,"Excelente, la fotografÃ¬a y ambientaciÃ²n da el toque perfecto a una tragica hisoria donde los conflictos son transversales a sus personajes. Impacta la crudeza de las escenas de batalla y la lealtad de los samurais a su seÃ±or"
1.0,ran,there are really pretty colors and samurai charging each other.
1.0,ran,this film justifies the use of color for film. The stark use of it makes for visual masterpieces that should be required viewing for all art majors
1.0,ran,"Akira Kurosawa does big budget busy yet atmospheric King Lear meets samurai epic in glorious technicolour, featuring a mad dad, two no-good sons, one very angry woman, plus all out war. Absolute carnage. I loved this."
1.0,ran,Kurosawa is The Man.
1.0,ran,"An epic, moving and beautiful film. Kurosawa paints on a huge canvas but looses none of his trademark humanity, something that many a director mining for an Oscar can learn from these days..."
1.0,ran,"If there is such thing as a perfect film for me, I think this is as close as they get. There's nothing in this film I don't like. Visually mesmerizing, thematically powerful, emotionally haunting. I hate that something this good exists, because it forces me to face my own limitations."
1.0,ran,"To put it simply: King Lear where everyone actually has real motivations, rather than just being evil because the play needs a villain."
1.0,ran,As epic as epics get. Massive battle scenes would lead one to believe that making LOTR without any CGI would be possible.
1.0,ran,AMAZING!!! Kurosawa is a genius! One of the best war films I've ever seen.
1.0,ran,King Lear. Medieval Japan. Kurosawa. You haven't seen yet - Shame on you!!!!
1.0,ran,"This is a tragedy, one of the most bleak movies of all time. As well as one of the most perfect."
1.0,ran,"quite possibly the apex of kurosawa's brilliant career. his version of king lear, perfectly transposed to feudal japan is restrained, beautiful and tragic."
1.0,ran,Arguably the most beautifully shot and designed movie I've ever seen.
1.0,ran,Kurosawa's bloody take on Shakespeare's King Lear is a feast for both the senses and the mind.
1.0,ran,so nihilistic that you probably won't be able to sleep peacefully ever again. the tragedy of man's eternal search for bloodshed. yay.
1.0,ran,The only way I can describe this movie is as a masterpiece
1.0,ran,"Visually beautiful, especially towards the end, there's this a battle scene in slow motion w/ excellent music in the background. Almost surreal. Brutal."
1.0,ran,The battle at the third castle is one of the most beautiful pieces of film I've ever experienced.
1.0,ran,Kurosawa + Shakespeare = Masterpiece
1.0,ran,"Ran, simply put, is a cinematic masterpiece. The cinematography is absolutely perfect and precise, the shots and settings are beautiful and stunning, and the character development is complex and masterfully executed. Another excellent film by Akira Kurosawa."
1.0,ran,A fantastic & truly great film - Kurosawa's final great epic
1.0,ran,A Japanese re-rendition of Shakespeare and one that quite surpasses the original.
1.0,ran,Visually the most entertaining of Kurosawa's body of work.
1.0,ran,"Called the master's best film and for good reason. This is Kurosawa's adaption of King Lear, and he owns the material completely, making you think that Shakespeare stole his ideas from Japan."
0.0,ran,"Perhaps I'm not cultured enough, but I found this movie long and boring. It was pretty hilarious when the king was all confused and had flowers in his hair. But let's face it, I had not idea what was going on."
1.0,ran,Immense. The transposition of King Lear into Japanese cinema is inspired. The enormity and artistry of cinema has never done Shakespeare so much justice. And vice versa.
1.0,ran,A great Japanese King Lear! Powerful!
1.0,ran,"A riot of colour, violence and intrigue in this adaptation of King Lear from the master of period Japanese film."
1.0,ran,"Another stupendously good film from Kurosawa, this one an adaptation of King Lear. Ran is a stunningly powerful war drama and is unforgettable."
1.0,ran,"This is one of my top-five. Why? Certainly for the imagery (that's what the movies are about, if you ask me), more than the story (King Lear). The battle scene(s) are simply the best movie scenes ever done. Period."
1.0,ran,"This movie is the definition of Epic.  Plus, all the extras actually died. Japan is so xhardxcorex."
1.0,ran,"The greatest film ever made, by the greatest filmmaker of all time! It's long, though, and not for the casual film-goer. You won't get much out of it unless you are willing to ""read into it."" Don't watch it JUST for entertainment value, like so many losers out there do!"
1.0,ran,A classic by Kurasawa
1.0,ran,"All I have to say is that this should have won Best Picture in 1986. Instead the Oscar went to ""Out Of Africa"". Oh, the pain!"
1.0,ran,great movie enjoy kurosawa
1.0,ran,"Absolutely goddamn masterful. Released in the '80s (not 2000 like this site mysteriously says), this is Kurosawa's last true masterpiece. Probably my favorite film adaptation (however loose) of ""King Lear,"" and some of the best battle scenes in film history."
1.0,ran,Akira Kurosawa's best shot in my opinion! Great movie.
1.0,ran,This film is breathtaking. It is clearly Kurosawa at his best. Normally I despise interpretations of Shakespeare but this makes King Lear as poignant as ever.
1.0,ran,A Glorious masterpiece that all true movie lovers should see.
1.0,ran,Commanding. Epic. Majestic.
1.0,ran,My favorite all-time movie. Epic and bizarre yet poetic.
1.0,ran,This is one of Kurosawa's masterpieces. The film is a retelling in of King Lear on an epic scale. The battle scenes are terrific.
1.0,ran,Kurosawas's retelling of King Lear would made Shakespeare proud! Has the best battle sequence of all time as well!
1.0,ran,"it's a long movie, but it's worth it with the beautiful story."
0.0,ran,Snooooore Fest but I get that it's a classic...
1.0,ran,I remember this one from when I was little...still one of my faves!
1.0,ran,"Epic translation of King Lear twinned with the Japanese legend of three arrows. Performances range from excellent to sublime. Minamalist music sets of the immense beauty of the background. Builds up to a stunning culmination of loss, betrayal and murder. A perfect film."
1.0,ran,"Post-apocalyptic, despite the fact that it's set in the 1600's. A guttural lamentation to the miseries of the world."
1.0,ran,"loved many things about this movie and i am not blood thirsty, but that was some of the best blood spurting i have seen and the dying man holding his own severed arm. wow."
1.0,ran,"Yet again, superb work from Kurosawa."
1.0,ran,fantastic and beautiful movie
1.0,ran,Kurosawa is not a broom... ; )Inspired by Shakespear..
1.0,ran,amazing visions and depth.
1.0,ran,"I hate to say this, but this may be the greatest Shakespeare adaptation of all time."
1.0,ran,Blood is not thicker than water!
1.0,ran,one of my favorite films of all time; back before CG armies
1.0,ran,"Paranee, oka katselu kerta. Ja Maijakin alkoi heto odotella seuraavaa. Kertoo maailman lumipallo efektista, jonka ehka ihmiset voivat saada alkuun, mutta jota ei hallitse kukaan. Siita nimi ""sekasorto/kaaos"". Lisaksi nayttaa mita kay jos joku todella ymmartaa miten valo taittuu ja tekee elokuvan."
1.0,ran,"it is an excellent adaptation of king lear, the videotape we watched though must have been so sucky though because it looked like it was from the '70s"
1.0,ran,My heavens. Kurosawa's best? Probably. As good a film as Lear is a play.Yeah. It's that good.
1.0,ran,"the idea of remaking a Shakespeer masterpeice in another culture is great, Kurosawa pulled it off flawlessly...A perfect tragedy"
1.0,ran,- I am lost...- Such is the human condition.
1.0,ran,"A masterful film with amazing set pieces. It is worth trying to get a hold of the special edition of this film, as the DVD has a making of doc on it with behind the scenes footage of AK."
1.0,ran,Lear in Japanese sounds like a strange idea but this is vintage Kurosawa. The concepts of honour/dishonour and family are also very Asian as Kurosawa depicts. The visuals are a feast - see it on a big screen.
1.0,ran,The David Lean of Japanese cinema. I am truly ashamed to say i have only seen two Kurowaswa films. I dont know why?
1.0,ran,"One of the biggest, if not the biggest influence on film-making even to this day. Kurosawa truly captures you in this film, through beautiful visuals, unbelievable shots of Japanese landscapes, and more."
1.0,ran,"beautiful visuals, tried and true story expertly told, well acted, enormous armies on horseback executing maneuvering on the field? count me in!"
1.0,ran,"The most tragic, beautiful, and intense movie since Das Boot, and I think a considerable expansion and improvement on Shakespeare's tragedy of King Lear."
1.0,ran,Akiro Kirosawa is the man - George Lucus stole alot of ideas from him - shame on you George...but chur for the Empire Strikes back aye
1.0,ran,Yet another masterpiece by Kurosawa. I want to have his babies.

1.0,1000121-39_steps,"I love this film: it's exciting and funny and extremely risque for its time. Unlike many thrillers which veer towards the spectacular, The 39 Steps is nicely understated, letting the dramatic storyline and personal charm of the characters speak for themselves."
1.0,1000121-39_steps,"A good early Hitchcock movie, with many of the elements are distinctly his style. Simple yet well-paced, with good interplay of suspense, comedy and wit. A classic with genuine acting and bold performance."
1.0,1000121-39_steps,"a kind of pre-Northbynorthwest spy-chase thriller and, in my humble and probably alone period, better even in older and less polished circumstances. Hope maybe to see the play!"
1.0,1000121-39_steps,"Brilliant sabotage film, with one of the bravest cameras Ive seen in older movies. Robert Donat oozes charm."
1.0,1000121-39_steps,"Ah...the premises for the many ""wrong man on the run"" films by Hitchcock. However, the original will always be the greatest. The 39 Steps promises nothing but thrills. It also introduces the MacGuffin principle which is now used constantly. Prepared to have your breath taken away."
1.0,1000121-39_steps,just saw this at the bryn mawr film institute as part of their hollywood summer nights series. i really was impressed with the writing and with robert donat's charm. the film's humor works perfectly with its suspense... highly recommended.

1.0,1000121-39_steps,My best film ever! Hitchcock's direction of this suspenseful thriller with the gifted Robert Donat in the lead made this the movie all future thrillers would aspire to.
1.0,1000121-39_steps,"Old school cool: gorgeous black and white cinematography and Alfred Hitchcock's indelible genius, perfect. This 1935 classic is a masterclass in directing, storytelling, and innovative but no-nonsense camera work, a la Steven Spielberg. A hugely entertaining, archetypal ""wrong man"" thriller."

1.0,1000121-39_steps,"The acme of Hitchcock's British era films and a showcase for the master at the height of his skills. More than just a suspenseful thriller it's an incisive look at the battle of the sexes and, finally, the redemptive quality of love."
1.0,1000121-39_steps,This is one of the most fun thrillers I've ever watched (so far). It's such an easy film to get into and once you're hooked by it you'll go with it until the end. Classic!!!

1.0,1000121-39_steps,"Cracking little adventure in which we see Hitch settling into his terror/humour stride. Rattles along at a good lick, Robert Donat and Maddie Carroll rub each other the wrong way in the most splendid of fashions, and it has almost fairy tale moments along the way."
1.0,1000121-39_steps,Maybe the best Hitchcock's movie for me. Wonderful Madeleine Carroll.
1.0,1000121-39_steps,Hitchcock defines the comedy/thriller template. It remains just as effective some 70 years on.
1.0,1000121-39_steps,"La periode anglaise de Hitchcock est moins connue que ces films americains, mais elle est revalorisee par les historiens depuis plusieurs annees. Les 39 Marches represente un sommet de cette epoque, parfois plus interessante que les classiques du maitres du suspense."

0.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,"A psychedelic waste pit of ugly UA animation, a song the only makes sense if you are on LSD, an bad acting."
1.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,"It's visuals may not be of the comprehension of some viewers (inluding me) but that can't remove the fact that Yellow Submarine is more than a musical, it's an authentic piece of art. Even many years after it's release, it has the same magic."
1.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,Endlessly inventive animation invigorates this tale of the Beatles saving a psychadelic fantasy land from a nasty horde of invaders. The images stagger the imagination and overall the film serves as the perfect complement to the Fab Four's late 60's material.
1.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,My favorite movie ever!

1.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,"I love the animation, very psychedelic and I especially like all the inside jokes in the movie (4,000 holes in Blackburn Lankashire, enough to fill the Albert Hall). Probably my favorite character was Jeremy. Great for kids and Beatles fans."
1.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,Psychadelia at its animated finest.
1.0,beatles_the_yellow_submarine,I wish they still made animated films like this. The animation style and Beatles songs fit perfectly hand in hand. Some segments were just stunning beyond belief. It's all in the mind.

1.0,wall_e,I loved it. Didn't mind the enviro-message. It worked in the course of the film. How do you develop characters so well without dialogue. And the Apple start up sound!
0.0,wall_e,It sucked!!! It's a huge flaming piece of dog ****.!!!!!!
1.0,wall_e,El futuro de la humanidad hecho pelÃ­cula
0.0,wall_e,"This movie is just trash. It's gross, not fun, and confusing. It's as if the creators didn't know what the target audience was, so they just acted like it was a kid's movie."
1.0,wall_e,The 2001 A Space Odyssey of animation!

1.0,wall_e,Best movie ever!!!!!!!!!
1.0,wall_e,A smart and timeless film whose environmental message still relates to our world. Should have been nominated for Best Picture of 2008.
0.0,wall_e,"Despite a truly charming first 45 minutes, the part with the humans is truly disgusting and depressing, making for a less than happy experience."
1.0,wall_e,"Such a wonderful film, one of Pixar's best work. No dialogue in the first half of the film and it is still interesting. Wall e and Eve are likeable characters, when they have no speaking scenes. A must see."

1.0,wall_e,This is quite possibly my very favorite Pixar film in a long line of great films from Pixar! I only just saw it yesterday. I wish it hadn't taken me so long to finally see. The message and concept was so cool! Right up my alley and a great Sci-Fi film!

1.0,wall_e,"If this isn't Pixar's best film, then i'll eat my shoes."
1.0,wall_e,This is a gray movie all about a lonely robot called WallÂ·E. It's stirring the future and everyone's gone and up in space because the world's polluted and all of the WallÂ·E robots were left to clean up the world's trash and stuff. I loved it so mutch they I bought the video game on PlayStation 2!

1.0,wall_e,Still a better love story the Twilight
1.0,wall_e,"Cute, affable story of a recycling robot who falls for another, more advanced female robot. A romantic Toy Story with humans as a side item. A bit of ecology-oriented messaging too."
1.0,wall_e,"Pixar's Wall E is entertaining, funny, romantic and action packed."
1.0,wall_e,"This is my favorite Pixar Film. It's creative, it's emotional, there's not a character I dislike or even don't care about, the morals are some of the best I've ever seen done for any movie. I would call it a perfect Pixar Film"

1.0,wall_e,"Toda una critica al sistema consumista! Una sci-fi masterpiece! Obra de arte de la ciancia-ficcion!! Esta no es una pelIÂ­cula para ninios. No digo que los ninios no sean capaces de disfrutarla, sino que los adultos son quienes la disfrutaran a su maximo potencial!!"

1.0,wall_e,A touching family animated adventure.
1.0,wall_e,"For a film that only had two spoken words for the first half, this film is a masterpiece."
1.0,wall_e,Wall-e is a pinnacle in Disney Pixar's stellar animation movies. Its a long way away from Finding Nemo in terms of Emotional Content but the sheer visual magic is yet to sunk in even after years of watching it.
1.0,wall_e,An emotional roller coaster with a great meaning behind the great visuals. Wall-e is pixar's best film to date. 5\5 Excellent.

1.0,wall_e,one of my favorites!!
1.0,wall_e,Wall-E and EVE told the a beautiful love story without a single word.
1.0,wall_e,Who would have thought that someone could make a truly heart felt love story with robots who can barely talk? Apparently Pixar not only can do that but can add depth and layers that few dream of.
0.0,wall_e,I know that I'm gonna get ton of hate for this but in my opinion this movie sucked and was super boring.
1.0,wall_e,"One of Pixar's riskier efforts. But it pays off big time, with some rather adult themes coming into play."
1.0,wall_e,Pixar is just keep getting better and better.
1.0,wall_e,This movie looks so cute! How could anyone not want to see it? JUST LOOK AT HIM! Those sad eyes are just begging you to come see his movie. I can't wait!

1.0,wall_e,"WALL-E is Pixar doing what they do best: pleasing children and adults alike with their incredible story, wonderful characters, and beautiful visuals."
1.0,wall_e,"It's true design and meaning is hidden in the signs. The characters are never really just what and who they are. Like most classics, it calls you to look closer, deeper, and at yourself."
1.0,wall_e,Disney Pixar is incredible. WALL- E is a great achievement and sure to set a standard for future animated movies.

1.0,wall_e,Brilliant and captivating. ^____________^
1.0,wall_e,This film is by far my personal favorite of all animated movies. Everything is beautifully put together.

1.0,wall_e,Another beautiful Pixar film.
1.0,wall_e,One of the cuties best movies ever
1.0,wall_e,Very enjoyable movie...even the tenth time!!
1.0,wall_e,"While my favorite Pixars will always be The Incredibles, the Toy Stories, and Monster's Inc., will not deny the fact that WALL-E is Pixar's absolute best and most important movie. It is a movie that truly has something to say. Near perfection. Bravo."
1.0,wall_e,Visually stunning. Incredible story. A remarkable animated film that presents an interesting social commentary.
1.0,wall_e,"This is the best movie I have seen in soooo long! I laughed, I cried... This is totally in my top 3 favorite movies. So funny and you just cannot help but fall in love with wall-e. I grew up with E.T.... and this just knocked that out of my top list."
1.0,wall_e,Touching and heartwarming as you would expect under the Disney name but with a healthy cynicism that Pixar do wonderfully well for audiences of all ages
1.0,wall_e,cute and heartwarming. Anything by disney/pixar is worth a watch.

1.0,wall_e,"Not my favorite, but certainly the best of Pixar. There is a difference."
1.0,wall_e,I challenge anyone to watch this and not fall for Wall·e!
1.0,wall_e,"Wall-E is beautifully made and it manages to tell a love story without any dialogue at all (something which Up did the next year to the tenth degree). It's brilliant, but what keeps it from being my favorite is the perhaps overbearing themes throughout."
1.0,wall_e,Best animated film ever!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,wall_e,"Designed to tug at your heartstrings, but done with such nuanced flair, I wish I could give it a bonus star."
1.0,wall_e,A film you can never get tired of.
1.0,wall_e,It has a GREAT message and the animation is a fantastic example of how far Disney has come.
1.0,wall_e,"If you can get past the obvious politicalism and ignore the poor fat people jokes, this one is hillarious! Oh, and be sure to catch the short ""Presto"" before Wall-e starts. Get that popcorn and get seated!!"
1.0,wall_e,"Another memorable Disney-Pixar gem. A simple and well made science fiction movie that kids and adults will enjoy, along with the important message of caring for the environment, the earth, our home."
1.0,wall_e,"Tell me a movie that in the first 30 mins., that has no dialog but conveys so much within that time frame with that kind of CGI beauty?"
0.0,wall_e,Movie is borning and lame
1.0,wall_e,"In addition to its undeniable sweetness, there is ecological commentary embedded in Wall-E that succeeds without preaching at its audience."
1.0,wall_e,Such a...cute movie. I would definatly recommend it!
1.0,wall_e,"still such a wonderful/beautilful film,stunning cgi & good story with funny scenes & charactersone of the best pixar films so far, a masterpiece"
1.0,wall_e,"The movie was full of heart and it made us all turn the other sheeck, stop and think about the world for a moment."
1.0,wall_e,Eva and Wall-e's love is truly touching. Teaches kids to stay close to good friends and you can accomplish anythimg
1.0,wall_e,"Had been looking forward to this film since I saw the first trailer and was not disappointed. Once again, Pixar delivers a great love story between two endearing characters and also (though unintentionally) delivers an environmental message of what we humans are doing to our home."
1.0,wall_e,Really good n funny movie
1.0,wall_e,I cried at the brilliant emotion portrayed in this superb romance from Pixar.
1.0,wall_e,The perfect animated movie
1.0,wall_e,Another great example of what Disneys Pixar has to offer. A very moving movie even though there was no dialog. Its almost as if I could feel what Wall-E was feeling.
1.0,wall_e,The primary use of body language in this film makes it unique. The ptomaine displays it's boldness in a good light.
1.0,wall_e,"Arguably Pixar's masterpiece and inarguably one of the greatest films in cinema history, ""WALL-E"" is supremely intelligent, touching, and nostalgic, with characters and themes more poignant than most live-action pictures could only dream of possessing."
1.0,wall_e,This movie is wonderful.
1.0,wall_e,"It's very hard to pick a favorite Pixar Movie, but for me Wall-e comes very very close. The way the story is told makes you care so much for the main character's journey, which combined with mind Blowing visuals and sounds, results in a Amazing Movie! Thanks again Pixar"
1.0,wall_e,This has got to be one of the greatest movies I have ever seen in my entire life.
1.0,wall_e,"Wall-E is a maturely conceived production that largely succeeds emotionally, visually, and intelligently."
1.0,wall_e,"One of Pixar's greatest achievments thus far, and one of the most original and inspiring (though political/social undertones not subtle) animated films of all times. Simplistic, and simply a masterpiece."

1.0,wall_e,"Convertido en un clásico de Pixar gracias a su emotividad fuerte, escenografía e imágenes bellísimas y potentes, y una premisa simplemente perfecta. Es toda una oda al género de la animación y de la misma manera, a la humanidad."
1.0,wall_e,"Pixar had done toys, bugs, cars, monsters and superheroes. They'd already done a film set underwater. So, a film set in space with robots as main characters was an obvious choice, right? Well, they pulled it off spectacularly. It's one of my favourite films of all time."
1.0,wall_e,I love it great childrens movie
1.0,wall_e,"A love story of robots Wall-E and Eve attempting to save Earth over a plant, how simple for Pixar to make another grand slam. Also has a cool message in which you must not rely entirely on robotics to prolong your human life. It'll make you fat."
1.0,wall_e,One of my favorite animated movies. Such an interesting plot. And it looks amazing.
1.0,wall_e,Very sweet love story. A Disney film set in space. Love it!
1.0,wall_e,One of the best animated movies of all time. Pure Pixar Perfection.

1.0,wall_e,Just a perfect movie
1.0,wall_e,Probably my most favorite animation film ever. I was a sucker for a lonely humble robot doing his job and seeking love. A kind-hearted film with its necessary humor. I loved it. The action and storyline were wonderful. Great film.

1.0,wall_e,One of the most heart-touching movies I have ever seen.

1.0,wall_e,this movie was everything i expected it to be and more. really adorable!! who knew a cock roach could be so cute!
1.0,wall_e,"This just prooves that the Pixar folks are supreme storytellers. You would expect the visual greatness, but that takes a backseat to the characters. While later viewings may make me wish for a bit less commentary, and more of Wall-E exploring Earth... this movie is just plain great."
1.0,wall_e,"Amazing how they can tell such an amazing robot love story without saying a word. Beautiful visuals and heartwarming story., just the thing we expect from a Disney Pixar."
1.0,wall_e,Another Favorite... Our family watches this one yearly @ least!
1.0,wall_e,By far the best pixar film of all time !!
1.0,wall_e,"Where do I begin? Lovely, charming, stellar images. Forget it being one of the best Pixar films, it's one of the best Sci-Fi films period. WALL-E and Eve have great chemistry together, and the way it looks is just breathtaking. And wait, it's a movie promoting environmentalism that's....SUBTLE???"
1.0,wall_e,Can't saw nothing bad about this movie. Everything was excellent!! PIXAR does it again! A Classic!! An animated 2001.
1.0,wall_e,Freaking phenomenal. The sound design is truly the highlight of Wall-E and of course it's full of beautiful animation. How did Andrew Stanton go from this to John Carter?
1.0,wall_e,Freaking phenomenal. The sound design is truly the highlight of Wall-E and of course it's full of beautiful animation. How did Andrew Stanton go from this to John Carter?

1.0,wall_e,A brilliantly charming film with adorable characters amazing visuals and fantastic animation. A Pixar masterpiece.
0.0,wall_e,It's over rated and boring with an unmemorabble plot. It's at least nice to see a toy meets girl story.

1.0,wall_e,Cute robots trucking around like they own the place. And they do. This movie is beyond cute.
1.0,wall_e,Not since Bambi has a movie used so much emotion with very little Dialogue. What's wrong with it? Uh....... I got nothing
1.0,wall_e,"Wall -E is just wonderful, especially the first part where Wall-E is on his own just going about his daily business. Nothing else I can add to all the rave reviews it's received, except to say see it on a big screen!"
1.0,casino_royale,"If its not the GREATEST film ever made, its definately the greatest action film ever made."
1.0,casino_royale,"Arguably the best Bond film of all time. The narrative is well structured and the film is full of brilliant one liners. Alongside the amazing acting of Craig, Green and Mikkelson you get some brilliant action set pieces, a superb score and some amazing cinematography."
1.0,casino_royale,This movie is exactly what a reboot needs to do.Daniel Craig is fantastic to this film and by far one of the best book adaptations ever made.Very excited for Bond 25!!!!
1.0,casino_royale,"great performance from Daniel Craig, and the unpredictable plot twist."
1.0,casino_royale,Daniel Craig is my James Bond Can't wait for Bond 25

1.0,casino_royale,I mean... Casino Royale is the first James Bond movie I ever saw and Daniel Craig just sold me the role completely.
1.0,casino_royale,"Craig makes the role his own, and will make you think Sean who? Incomparable acting, drama, suspense, and an ending scene for the ages. Not only is this the best Bond film ever, it is the best film of all time."

1.0,casino_royale,The best James Bond movie
1.0,casino_royale,"I went to see this movie with no expectations whats or ever, and it blew me away. This movie proved Craig can make for a great Bond, and gave us a balls to the wall experience, without the corky JB moments and with more intriguing characters."
1.0,casino_royale,"Daniel Craig's debut as 007 which he knocked out of the park. A very grounded, smart, realistic James Bond film. Casino Royale is debatably for most fans the best Bond film and I can honestly view this film as a movie of its own to be honest. Daniel Craig is the best bond since Sean Connery."
1.0,casino_royale,"This is most likely the best Bond movie, due to the fact that it has some of the best action scenes of all time, David Arnold's best Bond score, terrific acting from Daniel Craig, Mads Mikkelsen, Jeffery Wright, Judi Dench and Eva Green, and a vulnerable hero and villain."

Errol Flynn is the model for every leading man/ hero that came after him. Basil Rathone is the perfect villian. If you haven't seen it, please do. if you have seen it, see it again and again!"
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,A swashbuckling movie worthy of the title character.

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"A thrilling and lively version of the Robin Hood tale, and possibly the quintessential Errol Flynn film. The sets and melodramatic script are so hokey as to be charming. Rathbone is absolutely over the top. Huge fun to watch."

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,Was anyone ever younger and more full of life than Errol Flynn onscreen? Doesn't Olivia de Havilland's Maid Marian melt your heart? Doesn't Claude Rains define malevolence? And the musical score deserves equal billing with the lead actors!

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,My favorite Robin Hood by far!
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,Errol Flynn was the best Robin Hood ever! No amount of remakes or re-imaginings can change that. The word swashbuckler was invented for this movie. They just don't make them like this anymore.
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,The Perfect popcron movie in every way
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"Despite being tacky by 21st century standards, it is a great movie to watch in my opinion. I just love Olivia de Havilland. Errol Flynn is simply dashing and debonare, well-suited for Robin Hood. And Melville Cooper is a perfect bumbler as the Sheriff of Nottingham."

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"Unabashed, unrepentant, unassuming old-fashioned light-hearted entertainment of the absolutely highest caliber. Seriously, they don't make movies like this anymore, and I'm not talking about the technicolor. Point of reference: A New Hope is this in space."

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"Exuberant romance and chivalry.These were the glorious days of real Hollywood,glamorous still but somehow,the most amazing adventures were made at that time.Sharp,abundant,Flynn and de Havilland are superb."
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,The ultimate Korngold score -- written before they shot a frame. Arguably the ultimate Flynn too. Claude Rains and Basil Rathbone shine. Alan Hale is hearty.
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"When someone mentions Robin Hood I automatically think of Errol Flynn. This is by far the best Robin Hood Movie ever made.

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"Puts the swash in swashbuckler. Perhaps the perfect adventure film. Old school where bad guys are transparent and the Maid Marion is helpless.

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"A wonderful movie. Errol Flynn was the perfect Robin Hood, Olivia de Havilland the perfect Marian, and together they can't be beat.

1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,This is how action-adventure should be. The swordfight between Flynn and Rathbone is still one of the best in cinema history.
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,"Un scÃ©nario magnifique, un dÃ©cor en carton, tout un imaginaire marquÃ© par ce film, un chef d'Å?uvre de cinÃ©ma bourrÃ© de faux raccords et de nuit amÃ©ricaine, bref de gros trucages comme on aime. Vive le cinÃ©ma qui fait rÃªver sans avoir l'exigence du rÃ©alisme."
1.0,1000355-adventures_of_robin_hood,Still the best silver screen telling of the Robin Hood story of all time. Flynn and de Havilland are perfect together.

1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,"A snapshot of the late 20th century's obsession with UFO's, told with true cinematic panache by Steven Spielberg. The Director's Cut (not the Special Edition) is the version to watch if you have the choice. Truly breathtaking."
0.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,One of the worst movies ever! What was Steven Spielberg thinking? He's a great director but this movie is terrible. To be honest I fell asleep at the end. I guess I just don't appreciate this movie like some people. I just don't understand. 1/2 star

1.0,close_encounters_of_the_third_kind,"This movie is hard to explain, but it does fall into the ""film epic"" category. It's a very long, very slow, very intriguing look into a man who becomes obsessed with aliens - who aren't necessarily as bad as we make them out to be."

1.0,crouching_tiger_hidden_dragon,ANG LEE & Co. crafts a gorgeous film with gravity defying fight sequences and a heart breaking love story.
1.0,crouching_tiger_hidden_dragon,One of my favorite movies. And the battle between Michelle Yeoh and Ziyi Zhang was phenomenal.
1.0,crouching_tiger_hidden_dragon,Graceful. Elegant. A feast to the eyes and spirit.

1.0,crouching_tiger_hidden_dragon,"Elegant, sophisticated, complex, deep and hauntingly beautiful, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is quite easily one of the greatest films ever made. The direction is so precise, the plot unfolds purely like clockwork and the visuals are absolutely exhiliarating."

1.0,crouching_tiger_hidden_dragon,the first of the best chinese movies.
1.0,crouching_tiger_hidden_dragon,One of the best Chinese films of the decade.
1.0,crouching_tiger_hidden_dragon,Exhiirating and energetic! Shows what martial arts is REALLY about!
1.0,crouching_tiger_hidden_dragon,"Dramatic and greatly artistic in every way. A great story which differs from the usual kung-fu/ action-movie. In my opinion, it's a ''love story'' in a context of martial arts times, rather than a kung fu movie with special effects and a horny girl sleeping with the hero."
1.0,crouching_tiger_hidden_dragon,One of my all-time favorite movies!
1.0,crouching_tiger_hidden_dragon,"most beautiful movie ever made, also has totally awesome fight scenes"
1.0,1019544-spartacus,"In my opinion, this should have been the most successful film ever at the academy Awards. It should have won almost all of the awards. One of the best films ever made."
1.0,1019544-spartacus,One of essential of epic roman movies. Kirk Douglas is astonishing so unforgetable as the iconic hero and liberator.
1.0,1019544-spartacus,"Kubrick's most underrated film, (which is curiously one of the best) presents us with the great vision of the director of the history of Spartacus.The performance of Kirk Douglas along with the handling of the story make this film a jewel of epic cinema, to the caliber of Ben-Hur or Quo-Vadis."
1.0,1019544-spartacus,Another classic from Mr. Kubrick.
1.0,1019544-spartacus,Epic classic. On Blu-ray and part of The Criterion Collection on DVD.
1.0,1019544-spartacus,"'Spartacus' is a classic that will rouse you with its epic tale of fighting for freedom, regardless of whether you like oysters or snails."
1.0,1019544-spartacus,"I forgot how great the acting is in this movie. Even though Kubrick later disowned the movie, I still consider it to be one of his bests."
1.0,1019544-spartacus,"A Kirk Douglas vanity project and plagued by production woes, this ambitious cinematic feat turns out to be stirring of epic proportions with no small aid from the writing by Dalton Trumbo, the sweeping score by Alex North and its cinematographic grandeur."
1.0,1019544-spartacus,A perfect film. Love every second of it!
1.0,1019544-spartacus,"Excellent addition to Kubricks catalog, and sword and sandals alike. Great acting, great screenplay, and epic soundtrack"
1.0,1019544-spartacus,With some action scenes and performances it serves to be a fine epic movie.
0.0,1019544-spartacus,Worth watching. Can't believe Stanley Kubrick was the replacement director. Jean Simmons was really beautiful.
1.0,1019544-spartacus,"Comparing the classical epics is hard, but adding the brilliance of Kubrick to one pushes Spartacus over the top in a big way."

1.0,1019544-spartacus,"The story of Spartacus has been told countless times, but what all other versions lack are Kirk Douglas' engaging performance in the title role and Stanley Kubrick's innovative direction."
1.0,1019544-spartacus,"Sweeping, visionary epic"
1.0,1019544-spartacus,"It's odd witnessing Kubrickean technique with the swords-and-sandals epic genre, but Spartacus is one graceful portrayal of leadership and defiance accompanied by the depth of Roman politics."
1.0,1019544-spartacus,that was awesome .. the slave who fought for freedom died seeing his free wife with his free son .. the end can summarize this amazing film

1.0,1019544-spartacus,"Incredible film from Kubrick, so detailed, everything on an epic scale and some excellent acting performances all around - a must watch"
1.0,1019544-spartacus,"Okay, so slave girls probably didn't look like Jean Simmons stepping out of a beauty salon, but this remains an incredible film. Triumphant and tragic, hopeful and cautionary. If you don't get teary eyed when Simmons shows the crucified Spartacus his son at the end, you may not be human."
1.0,1019544-spartacus,Kirk Duglass classic
1.0,1019544-spartacus,"It is surprising that hardly anyone realizes that this is a Kubrick film. It does have his style, it is just hard to pick up because the film was very much like the epics released at the time (I.E. El Cid, Ben-Hur, The Ten Commandments)."
1.0,1019544-spartacus,A Great movie star studded cast

1.0,1019544-spartacus,The only special effect being that you can believe it - save for the lack of sweat among the militarily superior and morally inferior Romans

1.0,1019544-spartacus,"This epic about the inevitable decline of the Roman Republic (and the Empire's rise) was a well-done masterpiece that will live in my collection until the end of time.It currently sits in my Blu-Ray collection with The Godfather, Blade Runner, and other classics and new films."

1.0,1019544-spartacus,"A very moving and compelling story of epic proportions. The plot is relentless, propelled by a dazzling screenplay.

1.0,1019544-spartacus,"One of the best ""epic"" movies ever made and it holds up very well even today. Also, it's pretty damn cool. Before ""Braveheart"" and then ""Gladiator"", there was 30+ years of ""Spartacus"" being the go-to movie when it came to epic bad-assery."
1.0,1019544-spartacus,"This rousing, action-packed Roman epic is unmatched in the genre. Born of Kirk Douglas' failure to win the title role in William Wyler's Oscar-feted Ben Hur, this iconic piece of cinema benefits hugely from having Stanley Kubrick at the helm. A true classic."

1.0,1019544-spartacus,"Kirk Douglas' classic of action, love, and courage."
1.0,1019544-spartacus,Films dont get much better than this. Probably Kirk Douglas's greatest movie. Olivier and Laughton steal the show though. One question though Who cast Tony Curtis!!!!!

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Brilliant. Completely mad in front and evidently behind the camera. The legendary partnership of Kinski and Herzog is born. And so is my fascination... Herzog is very easily climbing up the pile that is my list of favourite directors. More to come I hope.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,One of the best films i've seen in my entire life.This is one of those movies that defines why cinematography is the 7th Art...

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,So fucking EPIC. Ive watched this movie a bajillion times and the last 15 minutes still gives me goosebumps. Very very under-rated film. Everything about it is fantastic.

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"A obra prima de Werner Herzog na minha modesta opiniÃ£o. A atmosfera ominosa, opressiva, sufocante mesmo, desta pelicula, assemelha-se a um pesadelo que poucos filmes conseguem reproduzir."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Beautiful Soundtrack By Popul Vuh!

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Its portrayal of conquistadores as demented criminals in a wilderness beyond their comprehension is good.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Striking imagery and haunting themes of greed, immortality, and obsession, Aguirre takes us into the heart of darkness and relishes in it."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Simply one of the finest movies ever done, however, not for the American crowd who require gunfights and explosions every 3 minutes to hold their attention. Surreal photography, cinematography and soundtrack. The themes presented are timeless through man's history."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Werner Herzog's greatest work.  A haunting and doomed fever dream into madness.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Don't let the cover fool you, this is one of the best movies ever made, it is like someone took there handheld camera traveled back hundreds of years and started filming actual events, and Kluas Kinski turns in such a wonderful performance."

0.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"I love Herzog, but his decision to shoot the film in English and dub it in German was idiotic."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"A 20th century masterpiece, built out of blood, sweat and complete madness."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Incredibly haunting film. This movie obviously had a lot of influence on the making of Apocalypse Now, which automatically earns the film its due. Not very character driven, with the exception of Klaus Kinski's mad eyed Aguirre, the movie induces a mood that stays with you well after seeing it."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"""Ride, boldly ride/ The shade replied/ If you seek for El Dorado"" (Edgar Alan Poe). The inevitable ending of this film comes as no surprise to the viewer. Getting there is agonizing."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Spainards speaking German didn't seem quite right to me. :p But other than that, a brilliant movie and fine example of Herzog's genius. Thank you to my friend that introduced this director to me!"
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"More or less a perfect film, with the most fantastic establishing shot you will ever see, and a final scene that is unforgettable. And all the bits in between are fabulous too."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,One of Werner Herzog's masterpieces and notably his first film working with Klaus Kinski. You really have to see this film for yourself to understand what all the hype is about. See this film.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Unbelievable film, blurs the line between fiction and fact in true Herzogian style and features a manic, inspired explosion of a performance by Klaus Kinski. I won't try and sum it up, just see it!"
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,herzog and kinski's finest work togethet
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Herzog and Kinski score big with this one. The initial build up is slow but when things get going they get going. One of the most haunting depictions of a descent into madness ever on film.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Great movie with a great soundtrack by Popol Vuh, what it lacks in action it makes up in tension, and Aguirre's slow descent into madness is unnerving yet convincing. Fantastic little find of a movie which deserves more praise :)"
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"One of a kind, must-watch movie. Considered by TIME magazine to be one the best 100 films ever made. Klaus Kinski at his manic best."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Wow! This film explains the origin of our exploitation. Ironically, done by a german director. Great movie."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,One of the greats. every shot is mesmerising and the opening sequence is so haunting. Kinski and his raft overrun by monkeys at the end is one of the great images of cinema.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Although I am not a big fan of Herzog, I liked this film a lot. A dark parable about a bunch of Spaniards on a raft who want to conquer Latin America."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Ingeniously combines Herzog's gift for deep irony, his strong social awareness, and his worthy ambition to fashion a whole new visual perspective on the world around us via mystical, evocative, yet oddly direct imagery. It is a brilliant cinematic achievement"
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Onhan tama nyt mahtava! Great score. And how beautiful is the ending scene!?
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"I love you, Werner Herzog."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"One of Werner Herzog's most disturbing films, and also one of his craziest and most insane and greatest! It's very documentary-like and it challenges the viewer in a very unique way. Just see it. You won't regret it."

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Fantastic, hands down for Herzog's best effort, the cinematography and Klaus Kinski were superb"
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Filmmaking as adventure, Herzog and Kinski were an amazing pair."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,A masterpiece. One of Herzog's best films and perhaps Kinski's best performance. The last shot is as striking as any before or since.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,An amazing movie from start to finish.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"First collaboration between Herzog and Kinsky and... bingo: well deserved success. As with a number of Herzog productions, the story of making Aguirre (the character based on infamous Lope de Aguirre) is nearly as fascinating as the film itself. And there wouldn't have been ""Apocalypse Now""."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,THE BEST OF THE BEST
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,I love Herzog. Herzog + Kinski = even more love.

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,I think I would never find the right words to express how impressed I am with this film...Klaus Kinski can be as scary and crazy as he wants to be.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"An epic masterpiece and Herzog's greatest movie.Everything about this movie, from the acting to the cinematogrophy to of course the directing, is amazing.However, while this movie is technically awe-inspiring it remains an intensly entertaining piece of cinema with a fair amount of action."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Add a review (optional)...
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"The madness of Aguirre mirrors the madness of Kinski. The editing and action mirrors the rapidity of the Amazon. Where the river fans out and become serene, so does its action while the madness is increased. Amazing!"

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,The Heart of Darkness as played out in Peru instead of Congo with Kinski playing a most diabolical variation of Kurtz. Herzog's use of the intense and natural beauty juxtaposed against the evil of power ambitions is very compelling.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"The powerful and near demonic screen presence of Klaus Kinski, combined with the very real danger of the nature that surrounds him and Herzog's gift for making every shot count, is quite remarkable."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"The best sort of film: one that sticks in your mind and stays there, whispering to you. Like Picnic At Hanging Rock, this is a slow film of small incidents, and it leaves the audience to construct what they will from it. Wonderful and enlightening stuff."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"I have to go and lower some other movie's scores now. Hypnotic and visually dynamic, the cinematography and Kinsky's performance make for a disturbing combination."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Methodical, and Hypnotic, Aguirre had me floored. After watching this you really feel like you are one with the world around you."

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"I laughed , I cried , It was a masterpiece"
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"a hypnotic voyage into madness. This is not a film for everybody, it is surreal and bizarre. If you are new to Herzog it may be a bit much. It is though a grand allegory about madness, greed, desperation, and barbaric violence."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,One of the greatest films ever made.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"The best of the three Herzog movies I've seen. The music, cinematography and acting (Klaus Kinski is amazing) are all a joy to behold."
0.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"It doesn't matter how many times people reference Apocalypse Now in relation to this film, it is still a travesty of a picture. Entirely uninteresting, unintelligent, flawed and laughably directed. Kubrick released A Clockwork Orange the year this film was produced, for goodness sake."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Wow this movie is weird,stunning,profound and powerful"
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,One of Herzog's best films. Klaus Kinski rules.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,A great film! A descent into madness on an insane quest for the city of El Dorado. Kinski is perfect in this role. A true Herzog classic!

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Insight into the madness of those who claim to speak for God
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Best opening scene I think I've ever seen in a movie. Dreamy, surreal, and a great soundtrack by Popul Vuh to boot. As for the rest of the film, it's great. Klaus Kinski is as deliciously bat-shit insane as he usually is."

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Kevin Bacon and Meryl Streep graciously reprise their roles in this German remake of 'The River Wild.'
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Can be enjoyed by Herzog nuts and causal fans alike. Surreal and increasinly disturbing. Also provides many icebreakers to us at parties, such as ""Oh, me? I'm [insert name], the Wrath of God."""
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Definitely a companion piece to Apocalypse Now, with an equal amount of nightmarish tension. Klaus Kinski is absolutely amazing despite, or maybe because of, the fact that he was completely insane in real life."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Arguably Kinski's best performance, and Herzog's best film. It is a story of a doomed journey to El Dorado and the mad man that led it, Don Lope de Aguirre"
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Sweet Movie with great visuals and an awesome score.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,as good as Fitzcaraldo.

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,The best climatic ending of destruction and self-delusion

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,the quiet pacing and detached camerawork really draw you into the film - you think that the film is going nowhere until you realize that the focus of the story is aguirre's descent into madness
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,best movie of all times!
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,What an amazing piece of work this movie is.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,One of the greatest films of all-time.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,This movie puts you into an alternate reality for 2 intense hours. Watching Klaus Kinski (Nosferatu) on screen is like watching a train wreck in slow motion.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"brilliant - one of the best management films i have ever seen!Paranoid, deluded, murderous and that's just the production crew!"
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,The best Kinski performance.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,A hypnotizing and visually beautiful film about man and his inherent need to controll the uncontrollable. Alternatively frightening and alternatively funny this is a movie unlike any other.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Much like trying to herd spider monkeys, the quest for El Dorado turns out to be quite futile. The Madness!!!"
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"I discovered this very recently, and my first reaction was HOLY CRAP! I am now, officially, a big Herzog fan - already awaiting the delivery of a full box set. As for a review, I can't offer anything that you can't read an inch below this box"
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Nothing less than phenomenal. The Germans have done it again! (I am grateful genius Director George Lucas has not seen this one.)
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Kinski is just scary as the conquistador, Aguirre. There's a moment where he's watching an Indian pan-piper, and you're expecting him to just stab him. A journey into the dark heart of the forest and man's soul alike."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Amazing opening scene. This authentic film that only Werner Herzon could direct. A film to enjoy.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"I was surprised with how realistic I found this movie. It seemed like the set design, costumes and performances were so real it could have been a documentary. Herzog is truly a director to be reckoned with and this is one of his greatest achievements."

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Dans la lutte a mort de l'homme contre tout principe de réalité, l'illumination de Kinski, comme terrorise par sa propre puissance n'a d'egale que la folie d'Herzog."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"You like your movies atmospheric? Aguirre, Wrath of God is perfect for you. You'll never forget Klaus Kinski brooding with an Amazon backdrop."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Intense. Kinski is terrifying. Aguirre talking to the monkeys at the end is one of my favorite movie moments ever.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Even better on the big screen. Thank you, Nashville, for having such a grand place as the Belcourt."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,This is a must see film.

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Excelente pelicula, Kinski + Herzog de lujo"
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,the scope of this film is staggering.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"l'esthétique de Werner Herzog + le talent Klaus Kinski + la qualité de la BO (par le groupe new wave allemand Popol Vuh) = un film absolument inoubliable, le plus beau de Herzog je pense"
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,a perfect portrait of insanity. great cinematography and spectacular acting. popol vuh fits so perfectly as the composer. just the right amount of subtlety and a minimalist plot means this goes on the list of my favorite films.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,This movie's DVD animated menu nearly drove me insane.  I enjoyed the hell out of the movie as well
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Brilliant! Der sker ikke en skid bortset fra det der sker inde i Aguirres hoved og det er wonderful.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,One of Herzog's best
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"I was lost in the madness that is Kinski's character's mind, and I loved it."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Anybody interested in the darker side of life should see this movie, even ifonly for the fantastic ending. You can sense the insanity flowing out of Klaus Kinski as the madman Aguirre, and make no mistake, Klaus Kinski is crazy too, along with Werner Herzog himself."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Herzog crafted an absolute gem here: one of the most visually stunning films of all time, the sound editing is tense and brings on a sense of dread and DOOM. Klaus Kinski is fantastic here, it's impossible to look away from his eyes when he faces the camera."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"it probably has the best opening ever... and the best final scene ever too, besides monkeys!"
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,A great film! You can definitely see how it influenced Apocalypse Now and also Terrence Malik's The New World. It is amazing how well it has stood the test of time.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Klaus Kinski is fantastic!
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Klaus Kinski is pretty much a GOD in this movie. Herzog's best and one of Klaus Kinski's finest performances as the vicious and maniacal Don Lope de Aguirre. As we follow his doomed expedition through the jungle and his descent into madness, you can't help but feel drawn into the haunting story."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Klaus Kinski at his insane best - Check him out in Fitzcaraldo as well.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Crazy, with a huge side dish of more crazy. I can say with absolute confidence that this is the greatest film ever made."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,The cannon is rusty!
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,I'm not exactly sure what this movie means. It is a suggestion of humanity maybe.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Sort of a biopic of a great but slightly flawed man. Walk the Line meets Dances with Wolves.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Kinski is a monster!
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Puts you into a trance - Herzog at his rawest.

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"La percezione della natura immensa e sovrastante e il modo con cui lo spettatore penetra nel paesaggio rendono questo film davvero affascinante.Il viaggio condotto da Aguirre è un viaggio verso l'inferno, l'influenza di questo film su Apocalipse now è massima..da vedere"
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"madness, death and the jungle in a herzog-kinski film. pretty much a formula for greatness."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Screwed up and dark, dark dark..."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Herzog's masterpiece featuring the best bit of acting Kinski ever did.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Hypnotic and spellbinding, borrowing from Conrad's Heart of Darkness, this is a magnificent film."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"When I watch this film I feel the desperation of the way the coquistadors lived. It was tough in the 16th century. The languid pace, the sense of being there with them and the stunning soundtrack by Popol Vuh combine to show us a vivid beauty. Kinski has as hypnotic a face as I have seen."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Amazing, so amazing. Kinski's footwork is just so key. His quest just condemns everyone around him, including himself. Just so so so good."

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Herzog is a genius. Groundbreaking cinematography, plus it has Klaus Kinski in it so its a miracle they even completed it. Simply a remarkable film."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,This movie is simply amazing. The logistics of shooting it are mind boggling in themselves. The story itself is remarkable and haunting; it will stay in your mind for a long time.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,One of my favorite movie endings.  Herzog / Kinski at their best.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,European colonialists go mad in the jungles of South America in maniacal pursuit of gold. Very engaging stuff and a fine allegory for politics as we experience them today. Herzog is a seriously Great Director.

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,mad as a bunch of hatterssorry conquistadors.....
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Great Herzog film depicting a greed induced descent into madness. Very effective use of Popol Vuh's music. Favorite scene was at the very end with the camera panning around the raft and Aguirre's remaining subjects.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,the most beautiiful anti capitalist piece of art ever made (exept of 9/11) or just a interesting historical story. or if you like little monkeys dancing..
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Sinking into madness and despair, Kinski gives one of his top performances showing the destructive effects of greed and ambition, and, in effect, blasphemy. A movie about the unravelling of man in the horror of nature and fate, Conrad and Golding are beautifully evoked."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Here is a movie I heard was good before ever seeing it. Upon seeing it, I wasn't prepared to how good it was going to actually be. I'm going to have to watch it again. And soon."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,solid. Herzog never takes any shortcuts and it shows. I don't particularly care for rainforest movies but this one is so irreproachable it gets the coveted five stars gratis.

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,The nightmare of a conquering dream.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Extremely intense. A good look at the effects of a strong hunger for power. Aguirre's monologue after he has the guy beheaded was really incredible.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"I give it five for describing desperation and nightmarish, never ending conquest...but it's so depressing, I won't watch it again..."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"I completely fell in love with this film the first time I saw it. There is a subtle beauty in the raw images and Kinski's performance is gigantic. It is probably the most unforgettable film I've ever seen, an absolute masterpiece from the great Werner Herzog."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Stunning masterpiece from Werner Herzog. Klaus Kinski is brilliantly insane in the lead role.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,A brilliant film on every level if you can see past the likes of Independence Day. If you like psychotic germans playing psychotic spaniards in a rainforest then this is the film for you.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Herzog & Klaus Kinski at their finest.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,Documentary realism meets dream-like surrealism in this masterpiece by the inimitable Werner Herzog. A rogue conquistador hijacks an expedition to El Dorado and leads it to its doom. Crazy man Kinski gives the performance of his career as the megalomaniac Aguirre.
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,When Kinski and Herzog get together you know something magic will happen. The descent into madness of Don Lope de Aguirre while he tries to find El Dorado and dreams of ruling the world. In one word: Powerful

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Between the history of this film and its making, Kinski's brilliant/psychotic performance as a madman (...as himself, perchance?), and Herzog's beautiful direction, Aguirre is a masterpiece."
1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Herzog, Kinski, a pygmy sloth, and a marmoset getting hurled off of a raft. One of the greatest movies of all time."

1.0,aguirre_the_wrath_of_god,"Severely creepy. Dare I say haunting? Yeah. Yeah, Iâ??ll dare that statement. This movie is haunting. Herzogâ??s best. And Kinskiâ??s. And cinemas...Al right. Not the latter, but I LOVE this movie. I mean. You gotta love that last scene. The one with the monkeys."

1.0,rio_bravo,"If you only see one Western ever, you might want to make it this one. The actors are all superb and the story, while simple, is compelling. In so many ways this is the model for so many Westerns that came after it (together with films like High Noon)."

1.0,rio_bravo,the cowboy flick to end all cowboy flicks.dean martin is drunk. john wayne is a stand up guy. ricky nelson sings. chyea.
0.0,rio_bravo,"John Wayne should've realized that when you make a film in response to another movie that the movie you're making has to be better than the film you're responding to. Horribly acted, horribly directed, horribly written. 1 star! High Noon is a masterpiece!!!"

1.0,rio_bravo,John Wayne underplays his character and lets Dean Martin take over in an often overlooked roll. The cast of characters are steadfast western favorites with just enough levity and seriousness to make this a fantastic move beginning to end.

1.0,rio_bravo,"With the steely competence of his adventure films, and the usual upending of the same typical of his comedies, it might be Hawks' richest, most complete film. Certainly Wayne has never been better--and he's easily outdone by Martin and Dickinson."
1.0,rio_bravo,John Wanye and Dean Martin...Think thats says enough! I watched this with my grandad and is the total reason why I love it. [Apart from Wayne and Martin]

1.0,up,I've heard good reviews on this one!
1.0,up,"Another awesome Pixar movie. Pixar is an inspiration to every animation studio. At the beginning of the movie, it's so sad because Carls wife dies."
1.0,up,This movie was perfect
1.0,up,my favorite of all time :)
1.0,up,The most emotionally masterful Pixar work since The Lion King.
1.0,up,"This film is brilliant because it bridges the gap between the young and the old. It's fun, silly, but smart and branded with genuine sentiment. p.s. see it in 3D"
1.0,up,Simply delightful. The movie makes you tear up in the first 20 minutes itself. The characters are sublime.
1.0,up,This movie was the first in a long time to completely warm my heart.

1.0,up,The opening sequence is ridiculously good - as is the rest.
1.0,up,"Another brilliant Pixar masterpiece. A thoroughly enjoyable film from start to finish. Heartwarming, bittersweet and very funny all at the same time. By far the best film I saw this year."

1.0,up,I consider this to be the best animated movie ever made. This is Pixar's finest and a perfect movie!
0.0,up,"Overhyped, Overblown, and Overrated, it can't be overstated. Animation that boast a greatness to come leaves us with unimaginative characters and a forced jumbled plot that takes itself WAY to seriously. Any genuine feeling soon becomes sappy in the run of its manipulative story telling."
1.0,up,"A clever, heartwarming masterpiece. Everything about the film works: the comedy, the story, the main characters, the side characters, the animation. Movies don't often come as perfect as this one."
1.0,up,"The beginning of Up is highly emotional and if those ten minutes alone were a short film, it would be just as great. This story has a basic enough plot for a Disney film and a couple of laughs manage to get in too."
1.0,up,"Heart touching, this is Pixar's best movie. It speaks to more mature audiences while being entertaining for the little ones. Up is an instant classic from 2009 to now, and should be one of the proudest animation ideas of all time."
1.0,up,Just amazing. The first ten minutes are heartbreaking.
1.0,up,"Any movie that can tell such a cute, depressing, and detailed story in such a short time, being the opening, is just perfect. I cried before the true adventure even began... I don't know what that says about me, but it says a lot about the movie."
1.0,up,Wonderful and captivating film
1.0,up,*sniffle... Beautiful...
1.0,up,"Simply breathaking, heart touching, PERFECT movie."

1.0,up,"Up is an exciting, hilarious, masterful work from Pixar."

1.0,up,"This movie is a great argument for why the Oscars should have a ""Best Voice Acting"" category. Brilliant story as well, great visuals, sweet ending."
1.0,up,The best family film of mortality EVER!

1.0,up,"You'll have to suspend your disbeliefs, but once you do that you are in for one of the best animated films of all time. Simple yet deep, funny yet sad, touching and confirming.

1.0,up,"Up is touching, funny, clever and fun! The characters and the story are well shown. Up is the best Disney Pixar movie ever!"
1.0,up,"No other film is capable of making me laugh, cry or smile as much as 'Up'.

Highly Recommended"
1.0,up,"One of the best, possibly THE BEST, Pixar film made to date. Such a heartwarming story, such a great message. Beautiful animation and characters as well. Overall, an extremely beautiful movie for all ages. Grade: A+"
1.0,up,Absolutely brilliant... Pixar at its best...
1.0,up,"Aug 2013 viewing: I forgot how much I really loved this movie. Changed it to 5 stars. :)Very cute, sweet movie. I would have liked to understand a bit more about why the adventurer turned from host to villain so quickly, but otherwise very enjoyable film."
1.0,up,Tugs the heart-strings. Another great family fave
1.0,up,Watched before July 2012
1.0,up,"This film is spectacular, it's start is heart wrenching, it's middle is funny, and the ending sends another perfect Pixar message, no matter how old you are it's never too late to have or be someone's adventure."

1.0,up,The first 15 minutes of this movie. Wow. That alone is worth the price of admission.

1.0,up,The Best Pixar movie besides Toy Story
1.0,up,"Brilliant, cute, action packed emotional film with a great plot."

1.0,up,My daughter loves this movie!

1.0,up,Beautiful and touching
1.0,up,This is the best Disney animation movie ever
1.0,up,An exceptionally unique masterpiece. Pixar proved it still has what it takes with this one.
1.0,up,I can't even begin to tell you how much I love this movie. The first 8 minutes of the film send you whirling through every emotion you have. This is one of my all time favorite Pixar films.
1.0,up,I could not love this movie more!
1.0,up,"One of my all time favorites. Dug steals the show. The first few minutes have almost no talking, but still told one of the best love stories ever. If you didn't cry in this movie you're a liar."
1.0,up,"A beautiful film for both children and adults alike. With the unusual quality of primarily being a children's film, while also tackling some of the deeper themes of life, that adults would relate to, heart-warming."
1.0,up,"Excellent movie! Most depressed Disney movie before Toy Story 3, but still good."
1.0,up,Animated Masterpiece...
1.0,up,"a heartbreaking romance between the old man and his wife, a father and son story between the old man and the kid, and an adventure story. mixing in some elements of a mid life crises film, and fantasy elements as well, and you got one of the best animated films of all time."
1.0,up,"First movie in a while to make me cry. Everything, from animation to storytelling is perfect."
1.0,up,One of the greatest and most tragic love stories ever told and that is just the first 10 minutes. Up has a lot to live up to considering the opening sequence and the plot requires the suspension of belief on epic levels but Up never fails to be great. All I can say is Squirrel!!
1.0,up,"A sad, but still heartwarming Pixar movie."
1.0,up,"Definitely my favorite animated film. One of my favorite all-time films. Arguably Disney-Pixars most sophisticated use of theme, message, and storytelling. At times funny but never gimmicky, at times devastatingly poignant but never sappy. A true must-see film for all ages."
1.0,up,Favorite movie of all-time
1.0,up,"This, in my opinion, is the best animated film ever. It's so touching, and very heartfelt."
1.0,up,Doug reminds me of my old dog it makes me happy

1.0,up,My Favorite Pixar movie of them all
1.0,up,"Exceeds expectations, even from Pixar."
1.0,up,"If I'm asked what's best of Pixar, I'll point my finger to this one."
1.0,up,Pixar does it again with this touching masterpiece. Anyone who's ever had a relative diagnosed with a fatal disease will truly connect.
1.0,up,the best kid moviefor adults
1.0,up,This is an amazing movie that proves that anybody can achieve something no matter how old. This is an amazing comedy and a great story. Pixar has done it again
1.0,up,One of the greatest animated movies since Disney's golden age. It tells an important story and deals with a difficult subject but is still fun for kids or anybody really.
1.0,up,This movie is perfect in every single way
1.0,up,nothing beats the first 10mins
1.0,up,An absolute masterpiece from the Pixar brand.
1.0,up,Best animated film in history
1.0,up,I laughed. I cried. I pretty much experienced the full gamut of human emotions.
1.0,up,"The first 7-10 minutes are movie making at its best, encapsulating two full lives in that short space of time. Amazing and deeply moving. The movie gets better from there."
1.0,up,This is 5/5 for the first 10 minutes alone
1.0,up,"by far my favorite pixar movie, possibly my second favorite animated movie"
1.0,up,"One of Pixar's best, what else can I say."
1.0,up,Really nice film can't believe I've only jus watched this.. Pixar r the best I liked the message.. Let things go and there is more important things in life.. :)
1.0,up,I always get tear up at the beginning of this masterpiece.
1.0,up,A movie about loss that leaves you uplifted. Another Pixar masterpiece.
1.0,up,"Pixar's uplifting, yet, somber tale of a widowed man whose journey of seeking to fulfill his wife's lifelong aspiration turns awry is, for a lack of a better word, a soon-to-be classic."
1.0,up,This movie made me cry and had deep underlying message. It was cute too.
1.0,up,Beautiful little love story intro and great message.
0.0,up,It tries to make you feel hope by showing you dazzling animation of an old man and a kid being really high in the sky. But there's no actual thematic elements or characterizations to make you feel this! It left me feeling more angered by fake hope rather than uplifted by real hope.
1.0,up,Great movie! Saw it with my kids and had to hide my tears at one point so they wouldn't see. This movie is way beyond expectations!
1.0,up,"Emotionally charged and very funny, this film will stick with you for a long time."
1.0,up,One of my Favourites
1.0,up,I love ice age 4I love up
1.0,up,"This was wonderful, with some elements that kids wouldn't really get or appreciate. I found the bond between Carl and Ellie touching and I hope I am lucky enough to find a love that lasts like that."
1.0,up,this movie is very tear jerking funny and quite mature at times One of Pixar's best
1.0,up,"Stay away from 3d. Doesnt work for everyone, even if you are pixar."
1.0,up,"""Up"" is one of the deepest films from Pixar. Only the introduction of the film is enough to make you leave the tears from your eyes. Definitely ""Up"" offers more than just a colorful adventure. And it lives UP to its name... XD"
1.0,up,excellent movie. I do not rate movies 5 very often this one is a exception. very funny especially dug. Carl is a grumpy but charming in a way and Russell is the type of kid you want to adopt. all I can say is WATCH IT
1.0,up,"Loved it loved it loved it. Really not a ""kid"" movie, but kids will enjoy it since it's a cartoon and there's occasional silly stuff... really is a story line geared towards adults, though."
1.0,up,I can't explain how great this movie is.
1.0,up,"Genial, super tierna. <3"
1.0,up,The montage about 10 minutes in makes me cry every time
1.0,up,wants to see it soooooooooo bad!
1.0,up,I saw the movie at cinema and really enjoyed it. It is good for adults too!!!
1.0,up,"It's truly marvelous how Disney keeps coming out with endearing Pixar films. This is a film that not only will children of all ages enjoy, but adults might also be touched by the heart-warming aura of Up."
1.0,up,I cryed at the beginning D: beautiful
1.0,up,One of the best Pixar movies ever.
1.0,up,it was interesting and exiting
1.0,up,I did cry but an amazing film :)
1.0,up,"First scene get's me every time....I have much emotion invested in this film (Ellie represents all my could-have-beens and losses) so I may be a little bias, but brilliant telling for a brilliant story. Filmography couldn't have been more perfect. Provides a perfect place on Pixar's Shelf of Fame."
1.0,up,An incredible cinematic achievement. Stirring in ways that may go over the heads of its younger audience.
1.0,up,enjoyable for the whole family
1.0,up,A+ Definitely a must watch.
1.0,up,It's the best movie Pixar has already done.
1.0,up,"A better love story than Twilight is described in the first five minutes. Possibly Pixar's best animation so far, besides Toy Story."
1.0,up,THIS IS A WARM HEARTED FLIM FOR ALL.I LOVED IT..
1.0,up,The most beautiful experience of the seventh art. A jewel of the film that gives a nod to childhood and old age so memorable. An unforgettable experience.
1.0,up,I think it's one of disneys best films and it's truly a rare masterpiece.
1.0,up,One of the best PG films ever made
1.0,up,very good movie I liked it.
1.0,up,The last REALLY good film Pixar made (as of this writing). Like Nemo it's one of the more emotional Pixar films but for the most part it's very light hearted.
1.0,up,I totally enjoyed this film with my entire family. The kids were cheering and I was touched by the love the principal character has for his wife. Life is truly an adventure and so is this film. Highly recommended!
1.0,chicken_run,So simple however so fun!
1.0,chicken_run,This film is pure genius. Great watch for all ages and on Netflix which is handy. Who would have imagined that chickens were hell bent on escaping?
1.0,chicken_run,"A true cinematic masterpiece, Chicken Run reveals the shocking truth of what really occurs behind the walls of factory farms. Brutally honest and carefully crafted, this documentary has all the potential to change the way Americans raise livestock forever."

1.0,1032434-killer,John Woo's masterpiece. I can't tell you how incredible this movie is.
1.0,1032434-killer,"far more coherent and heartfelt than hard boiled, although HB had a little more variance in its many gun fights. With a great performance by Chow yun fat and an ending of almost Shakespearean tragedy, it truly is the John Woo movie that defines his career and style."
1.0,1032434-killer,i watched this movie when i was 11 year old but i still remember every seen in it...
1.0,1032434-killer,"The movie itself is probably John Woo's greatest achievement. A Captivating story combined with brilliant Hong Kong gunplay, which basically inspired many young filmmakers to steal its integrity. Chow Yun fat is and always will be the ulitmate badass, according to this film."

Incredible!"
0.0,1032434-killer,Clever use of lighting and angles. Squeezes laughs out of the medical team continuing surgery at double gunpoint and the Triads' seemingly endless supply of hiker-assassins.
1.0,1032434-killer,This movie is amazing. One of the best action films of all time. It also has a real theme and some great depth to its emotion. And no no one ever runs out of bullets. That is awesome.
1.0,1032434-killer,"Captivating, and downright incredible. With all the action you can ever want, John Woo's The Killer is the truest and finest example of an action film that combinates both brains and brawns. Awesome."
1.0,1032434-killer,"Yes "" The Killer"" gets 5 stars from me. Chow Yun Fat plays one of the most lovable assassin's to grace our screens. But he deals out the justice to the bad guys in this John Woo film. Watch this film and you will be hooked on it."
1.0,1032434-killer,The best John Woo film and maybe the best film Chow Yun-Fat

1.0,1032434-killer,"This John Woo film is a classic in the genre, and may be the best Woo ever filmed. Cow Yun-Fat and Danny Lee are fantastic, and this story is far more in depth and character driven, though with less stylistic action, than Woo's hailed masterpeice Hard Boiled."

1.0,1032434-killer,"John Woo's one-of-a-kind, breathtaking action drama burns with passion. The action scenes are superlative, but it's the touching performances from Chow Yun-Fat and Danny Lee that really hoist this up to a whole new level. Perhaps the greatest action movie ever made."
1.0,1032434-killer,This is quite something. One just hopes that this would be musically dubbed in addition to voice dubbing. Listeing to the HK music requires something that I don't have...
1.0,1032434-killer,"Made well before John Woo started his slow, sad slide into uselessness."
1.0,1032434-killer,Another classic of my top-10 favorites!

1.0,1032434-killer,"Great film, absolute classic shoot em up. Ok so it is a little over dramatic and tries pretty hard to be cool... but without that it would just be boring! (Take note of the very similar scenes and sequences Woo used later in ""Face Off"")"

1.0,1032434-killer,The definitive John Woo/ Chow Yun-Fat team up.
1.0,1032434-killer,"In 1989, Woo shot this great gangster movie. Suddenly thrillers from the states appeared deeply old-fashioned and they start copying the john woo style. The most important, but maybe not the best, HK movie ever."
1.0,1032434-killer,What all american gangster movies WISHED they could be. This movie along with Hard Boiled are two of the greatest action movies of all time and should be REQUIRED viewing for any action movie fan.

1.0,1032434-killer,"The ultimate bullet ballet. On par with the over the top action of Hard Boiled, but with some of the emotional impact of A Better Tomorrow. Chow/Woo have teamed up for some absolutely brilliant films, but this is the single best."
1.0,1032434-killer,"The second great collaboration between Danny Lee and Chow Yun-Fatt, this is John Woo at his best. The montage of Chow and Danny in Chow's living room is a sequence to be treasured. Pure cinematic magic."

1.0,1032434-killer,"For me this is John Woo's greatest achievements. Forget those over the top hollywood films, this is the one to watch.  Next to Leon (by Luc Besson) Woo makes an assassin a character you actually care about. The film has so much emotion it flows out as much as the blood."

1.0,1032434-killer,Greatest Movie Ever made
1.0,1032434-killer,"Before John Woo bastardised his own unique gun-blazing style by taking it to Hollywood, he made films like this back in Hong Kong. Chow Yun-Fat stars as the cool hitman in a wondrously choreographed film of gun-play and assassination."
1.0,1032434-killer,a veritable composition in endless bullets and 120+ bodies; this film is a masterpiece.john woo is an artist.

1.0,1032434-killer,"The best action film ever made. Where ""Hard Boiled"" may top it in the number and visual quality of the gunfights (and only slightly), this movie has the John Woo's best example of character and morals surrounding disgusting violence."

1.0,1032434-killer,"Still John Woo's best, though Hard Boiled is more fun, this melodramatic story of a Hitman is simply riveting from beginning to end. And what a classic end!"
1.0,1032434-killer,"This movie comes in close second as the best action movie behind Hard Boiled. Even thought the plot is completely ripped off of Le Samourai, this movie is still awesome because of John Woo's insane gun fights. The church shoot out at the end is a must see."
1.0,1032434-killer,"Honour, redemption and loads of bullets. Amazing film."
1.0,1032434-killer,"Goddamn. John Woo + Chow Yun-Fat = greatness in all forms. The best work that the two have done together. Great story, wonderful actions sequences. What more could you ask for?"
1.0,1032434-killer,The man Chow Yun Fat and the master John Woo together for probably the strongest dramatical action drama. The action inspires every action film for the next 15 years. Superb.

1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"A great movie about greed. Bogart is outstanding, in my opinion he gives his best performance, even better than Rick is Casablanca, Sam spade in the Maltese falcon and Charlie in The African Queen."
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,Excellent movie! I have always considered 'Wall Street' as the best picture about greed until I recently saw this Huston's masterpiece. It is one of the few classics that deserves all its glory.

1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"La pelicula es muy elocuente y hace que uno se cuestione muchas cosas sobre uno mismo, da exelentes puntos de vista. Bogart esta muy bien, pero Walter Huston, el padre de John Huston, se roba el show, ya que es super carismatico. Muy buena direccion y guion de John Huston.-"
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"todo un clasico, y una de las mejores actuaciones de Humphrey Bogart"
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"Obra maestra de John Huston es una fabula sobre la codicia del ser humano y como la ambicion cambia a una persona , filmada en un maravilloso blanco y negro , con unos personajes memorables especiamente el de Walter Huston , de vision obligatoria"
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"If all you've seen of Humphrey Bogart is Casablanca, it's easy to overlook the fact that he was as well known for playing villains on the big screen as good guys. This film certainly qualifies as one of his villainous roles. An interesting character study and well worth the watch."
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,My favorite movie of all time. Hands down. A morality tale about the lust for gold and what greed does to the human soul.

1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"The arc of Bogart's character's movement into paranoia and madness is brilliant. I defy anyone to maintain their civility when there's so much gold at stake.

1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,This could be the greatest film of all time. It totally exposes the worst in the human experience and the irony is fabulous. Huston has outdone himself in this movie and Bogie should have won an academy award for this. Fred C. Dobbs is the quintessential Bogart character.

1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,Badges? Just kidding. The combination of Huston's unfailing eye for directing along with Bogart's best performance makes for a piece of art to be reckoned with.
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"Whenever I think of how good people can become corrupted and distorted by money and power, The Treasure Of Sierra Madre comes to mind. The Godfather is this movie's only rival when it comes to the story of a honest man's descent into evil.Definitely worth seeing."
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,Not Bogart's best film (that'd be Casablanca) but probably his best performance. A lesson on greed and mistrust that has timeless resonance.
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,Bogart blew my mind. Watching his mind becoming corrupt over the idea of getting this money was a trip. I'm a big fan of movies about greed destroying men cause its so fascinating to watch. And this was one of the first to do it really well. John Huston is a hell of a director not just an actor.

1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,Bogart never ceases to amaze me. This is arguably his best performance.What a ballsy script for 1948... or at least violent. And possibly one of the few films of the era without some sort of romance in it.

1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,I revisited this film recently. It's still one of the great adventure stories but at the same a fascinating morality play on the corrupting nature of greed.

1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,Humphrey Bogart's best film and a tale well worth telling. They just don't make 'em like they used to. This is probably the best movie that searches into the evolution of materialism and the downfall of the greedy.
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"Hard to classify adventure movie, one of Bogie's best performances. Great human drama that hits at the dark core of humanity in some chilling scenes. In its quiet way, the film builds slowly to a surprising and darkly ironic climax that is unforgettable."

1.0,moana_2016,"I had no desire whatsoever to see this movie. I thought from the trailers, it was about a girl, a man, and a chicken on a raft. I went ahead and watched it because I'm a HUGE Disney fan and loved every bit of it. The soundtrack was great and I plan to buy the songs. I find myself singing them daily."
0.0,moana_2016,"This movie was terrible. It is filled with tons of plot holes. If the water is so amazing, why doesn't it just bring the heart to Tafiti by itself? Only one song was worth anything. Would not recommend."
1.0,moana_2016,Watched this on a plane ride and it's a nice light-hearted film with beautiful islands and a strong-headed princess. Who needs a prince to save the day?

1.0,bourne_ultimatum,Best one in the series! Good ending and good cinematography except when it came to fight scenes. I loved the story and well everything about it.
1.0,bourne_ultimatum,Definitely the best of the three. Greengrass just may be a genius.
1.0,bourne_ultimatum,Paul Greengrass and Matt Damon working together is like a gift because the Bourne Ultimatum somehow improves from the first two even though they didn't need improvement. The best Bourne and now one of the greatest action films i have ever seen.
1.0,bourne_ultimatum,"This is how you close a trilogy, with a sharp plotter that does not abuses of well know clichés of the genre and maintaining all of the elements that made the prequels a success."
1.0,bourne_ultimatum,Perfect end to the series. Keeps you in suspense and on the edge of your seat the whole time. And the ending is absolutely class. The little smile and the Moby tune kicking in.

1.0,bourne_ultimatum,Matt Damon is Jason borne
1.0,bourne_ultimatum,"If it gets good revews, yes."
1.0,bourne_ultimatum,"An action/espionage masterpiece, Bourne takes quality acting from Damon, Stiles, and Allen and meshes it with Paul Greengrass' chaotic camerawork. Action is very tense, and the film is pretty darn resourceful."

1.0,bourne_ultimatum,The best Bourne yet!
1.0,bourne_ultimatum,One of the all time classics in my opinion. The pacing of the movie provides it a rhythm you rarely see in cinema. A 100% engaging film that has little room for improvement.
1.0,bourne_ultimatum,Jason Bourne's final hour is also his finest. Not too many threequals can say they stand head and shoulders above the rest of the movies within their trilogy. This is definitely one of those cases.
1.0,bourne_ultimatum,"Great movie, it wasn't as emotionally gripping as the previous movies but the plot and action scenes were really well planned out followed by some terrific acting."
1.0,bourne_ultimatum,"Really Really Really good, from start to finish! A great movie."

1.0,bourne_ultimatum,Matt Damon at his best my opinion this is the best Bourne film
1.0,bourne_ultimatum,"For someone who didn't actually see the Supremacy yet, it was a bit disjointed, but I figured it all out in the end - and loved the crap out of it."
1.0,bourne_ultimatum,"One of the best action flicks I've ever seen. From the moment the movie starts until it's jolting end, you are on the ride of your life. Damon, who I would have never imagined as an Action Star, has solidified his place among one of the greats"
1.0,bourne_ultimatum,"5/5 *Visceral, and intensely well shot, with intelligence. The action is well paced and detailed.The Bourne Ultimatum is still one of the great action thrillers in recent years."

1.0,bourne_ultimatum,Great finale to series!
1.0,bourne_ultimatum,Outstanding. I was very impressed once again just how entertaining these bourne films are. Solid movie that will always keep the viewer interested in Matt Damon's character. All due respect to Jeremy Renner taking over the role but I will miss Matt Damon as Jason Bourne.
0.0,bourne_ultimatum,"Some of the shoddiest camera work I've ever had the misfortune of laying my eyes upon! It was literally an assault and battery on my eyes, and stomach!Totally Unwatchable!"

1.0,bourne_ultimatum,This movie was excellent!!!!!!!!!! I absolutely loved it this is the best action of the year.
1.0,bourne_ultimatum,"Você é jogado de um penhasco gigantesco, em que a queda é rápida e excitante. Tudo o que você espera e quer de um filme de espionagem/ação, Damon entrega potencializado à algumas dezenas.Obviamente, ele entrega um ultimato: o nome é Bourne, Jason Bourne."
1.0,bourne_ultimatum,"Smart, well-acted, and brutal."

1.0,bourne_ultimatum,"It's not often a sequel compares to the first of a series, but it's extraordinary when the third instalment of a trilogy is the best. This closing story completes the incredible story and action-packed adventure behind the skeleton-packed closet of Jason Bourne."

I recommend not to watch the Redux version"
1.0,apocalypse_now,"Of the many facets of genius in this film, none is more stunning that the fact it is based on a fin de siecle novella by a Polish writer (in English) based in Africa. The adaptation to Vietnam of all of the above is a stunning achievement unlike any other in film."

1.0,apocalypse_now,I found this film hard to sit through.
1.0,apocalypse_now,"From the opening scene with the choppers , napalm and music ""The End"" by The Doors , and right the way through its a war film that dared to be different , and it just keeps you engrossed...Coppolas casting for this was a master stroke from Sheen,Duval& Fishburn to Brando & Hopperl , pure class...."
1.0,apocalypse_now,"I gotta admit it was a very well acted film, well written and all, and had more of a justice element then Coppola's films, but it was dark and had a very dark twisted ending to the film and it had alot of mysterious type of elements, good flim to watch again sometime, very errie too"

1.0,apocalypse_now,Surreal and mind expanding black comedy. It was not until my 17th viewing that I stayed awake through the Marlon Brando scenes.

1.0,apocalypse_now,Very trippy Vietnam war odyssey.
1.0,french_connection,"This is more than a movie, it's time travel to seedy 1971 New York. Everything the sites, the background sound, the music, the seedy bars, puts you back in time. It just so happens that a great cop movie happens at the same time."
1.0,french_connection,i love this movie about 2 cops trying to catch some sneaky criminals in 70s new york.
0.0,french_connection,How in the world did this movie beat out A Clockwork Orange and Fiddler on the Roof for the Academy Award for best film??
0.0,french_connection,This movie sucks. How did it win any awards. The lowest ranking allowable is a half start. I wish I could give it negative for taking an hour and forty-four minutes of my life away from me.
1.0,french_connection,10 out of 10:Great action and acting makes The French Connection a tense police thriller.
1.0,french_connection,"The 70s political, action classic that has a awesome car chase with Gene Hackman being himself, The French Connection is nowhere as great of any action film ever"

1.0,french_connection,"Classic does not begin to describe this film's place in 70's cinema. Gritty, fast paced, and unapologetic."
1.0,french_connection,"A crime thriller that shoulds be one of the best of all times. Gene Hackman as ""Popeye"" Doyle a non brilliant cop but a obssesive and stubborn one to get what his intuition says. A fabulous chase scene with Doyle in a car running behind the metro train."
1.0,french_connection,"""We're gonna keep coming back here until you clean this bar up."""
1.0,french_connection,Thrilling in any and every sense of the word.

1.0,french_connection,"Ufff, what a movie..."
1.0,french_connection,"A classic, The French Connection is one hell of a ride, with the great William Friedkin taking the wheel, the incredible Gene Hackman riding shotgun and Roy Schneider quietly great in the back seat."
1.0,french_connection,"excellent cast, story. screenplay"
1.0,french_connection,"It is of course a classic, and cool to see how this 1971 movie set the trend for a different kind of realism in cop dramas. And Hackman and Scheider are so young."
1.0,french_connection,Fantastic action movie! Gene Hackman at his definite best!
1.0,french_connection,"A tense, thrilling, powerful and fast paced thriller, The French Connection is easily one of the best thrillers around and its helped because of its outstanding performances and impeccable direction."
1.0,french_connection,A masterpiece from Friedkin. Popeye Doyle is probably my all time favourite cops. Hackman is on fire and that fricking car chase. A wonerful tale of cat and mouse.
1.0,french_connection,"I own this on DVD in a two movie pack along with:* French Connection II (1975)and I also own the ""Two-Disc Special Edition"" DVD."
1.0,french_connection,Exciting. Surprising. And (not surprising!) and excellent performance by Gene Hackman.

0.0,french_connection,What was so good about this movie?
1.0,french_connection,"The French Connection is a gritty and electrifying police thriller, an unforgettable product of the 'Hollywood New Wave'..."
0.0,french_connection,"It may have had relevance as a new style in 1971, but this film has little appeal today. TFC has been outdone by better directors since its release while the genre has been copied more times than logically possible for decades. Gene Hackman is not the same go-to actor he would eventually become."
1.0,french_connection,"The French Connection is a convincing, fast, unusually clever, masterfully acted, exhilarating creation."
1.0,french_connection,Excellent cop film that started a new trend!
0.0,french_connection,"I tried watching The French Connection... Sad to say, I found it tedious and boring."
1.0,french_connection,One of the great crime-thrillers of all time. Simply spellbinding from start to finish.
1.0,french_connection,Popeye Doyle will remain one of the most baddest asses of policemen ever.
1.0,french_connection,"The most realistic cop movie ever. It is slow at times, but that is because it recreates the pace of a cop's job. Gene Hackman's best performance and an strong sense of time and place more than makes up for it."
1.0,french_connection,"Trazendo uma Ã³tima atuaÃ§Ã£o de Gene Hackman e uma fantÃ¡stica direÃ§Ã£o de William Friedkin, ""OperaÃ§Ã£o FranÃ§a"" Ã (C) um dos melhores filmes policiais jÃ¡ feitos."
1.0,french_connection,One of my top-5 movies!

1.0,french_connection,"One of the best cop movies ever made, and the greatest chase scene ever filmed."
1.0,french_connection,Classic 70s crime-drama. It has one of the more memorable chase scenes and superb performers from Hackman and Scheider.
1.0,french_connection,this film includes the most brilliant car chase scene and the ending i've ever watched ....
1.0,french_connection,"It was said the movie had the first ever high profile speed chase and, it was indeed !Magnificent cinematography and it was in 1970â(TM)s filming with that technology."
1.0,french_connection,"Well, this ""dirty cop"" drama is quite odd, but of course as humorous, expertly well-acted, and action-wise the most thrilling of all-time. A 1971 Pontiac LeMans vs. an elevated train (with a fleeing hitman onboard) is what makes this film famous."
1.0,french_connection,"The original gritty, urban cop movie. Gene Hackman proves you don't have to be pretty when you know how to kick ass."
1.0,french_connection,"Slick, well-plotted, and with a terrific cast. Hackman never fails to deliver, and Scheider is great as well. This is a phenomenal movie, and a defining film of its generation. The critic that gave this a rotten should be tarred and feathered."
1.0,french_connection,Classic 70s action thriller
1.0,french_connection,"The french connection is the column of all police action movies, a very imitated film. i think the most influential film in history, for its structure and scenes, the most original without doubt."

1.0,french_connection,"You need to see this movie. It's rough, grimy, and very exciting. 1970s cop cinema at its best."
1.0,french_connection,"Seat of the pants exciting. And a car chase that is still, for me, the best in cinema."
1.0,french_connection,"Flawless, only Harry Callahan can top Popeye Doyle when it comes to cops on the silver screen"
1.0,french_connection,"Great, crunching, dark, satisfying slab of a movie. Actually a Christmas movie (Popeye dressed as Santa), and neo-noir. Huge performance from Hackman and some of the best editing in cinema. Solid."
1.0,french_connection,"Along with Dirty Harry, the greatest cop film of all time."
1.0,french_connection,Tied with Bullitt for the best cop film of all time. Hackman & Schieder make a great team. Some amazing car chases & cool shootouts.
1.0,french_connection,"A knockout. Popeye Doyle, gritty 70's New York and the best action sequence in movie history."
1.0,french_connection,"Why haven't I watched this before! Outstanding crime thriller, with its gritty portrayal of the narcotic detectives, Popeye and Cloudy, and their attempts to intercept a drug shipment and bring down those involved."

1.0,french_connection,A classic cop movie that has the best car chase ever
1.0,french_connection,"Great movie, fantastic car chase. Can't beat 70's cinema."
1.0,french_connection,"A movie that goes far beyond a memorable car chase scene, The French Connection maintains full force to date by the raw picture of urban decay, and above all by the coldly pessimistic ending, possible reflections of the North American political scene of then."
1.0,french_connection,"Una película casi perfecta. Violencia policial y degradación urbana realista, desagradable. Inspiración de muchos dramas policiales que vendrían después."
1.0,french_connection,"Flawless. Simply, flawless."
1.0,french_connection,The legendary car chase still holds up today.
1.0,french_connection,"If The French Connection isn't the coolest film ever made, then it's definitely in the top 5."
1.0,french_connection,The quintessential NYC cop movie.
1.0,french_connection,"A breathtaking crime drama film. The cinematography, screenplay, everything is great, the third act end up very quickly and that's the reason it can't make it into an epic."
1.0,french_connection,That masterpiece dictated how an action film should be. The realism on it is incredible
1.0,french_connection,"Featuring IMO the best chase scene of all films, this is a must-see for lovers of crime movies!"

1.0,french_connection,"Arguably the greatest crime film of all time; it's intensity is felt throughout, and it's action sequences, particularly the car-train chase scene, are some of the most dramatic of it's genre. The ending is poignant and strikes a nerve, and it just feels oh-so perfect."

1.0,french_connection,Excellent crime drama. Gotta love that chase scene.
1.0,french_connection,One of the best Gene Hackmen Movies you will ever see!
1.0,french_connection,"Best Cop movie ever. Best Car Chase in a movie ever, Bullitt sucks. Popeye rocks!"
1.0,french_connection,Ambiguity is what elevates this film above typical cop/action genre. The moral uncertainty encountered throughout the movie perfectly characterizes New York City in the 1970s- not a happy place to be. Futility is the name of the game.
0.0,french_connection,"yes the car-subway train car chase was pretty awesome in this, but the rest of this was dull as hell."
1.0,french_connection,Awesome. One of the best chase scenes.
1.0,french_connection,Absolutely loved this! Hackman's car chase under the elevated train is legendary stuff!! Scheider's dry witted side kick character is a hoot and this has be to Hackman's best performance ever!

1.0,french_connection,"Classic gritty thriller with Gene Hackman and Roy Scheider, the car chase is legendary and is worth watching!"
1.0,french_connection,"Excellent award-winner is gripping and visceral, yet as cold in tone as a New York alley on a cloudy day..."
1.0,french_connection,"probably one of the most underrated police dramas even though it won the Academy Award. Gene Hackman and Roy Scheider are simply fantastic as two New York City Narc detectives. Has a really good car chase, one that could even rival the one in ""Bullitt""."

1.0,french_connection,Perfectly encapulates how brilliant 1970s american cinema was
1.0,french_connection,"Along with Bullitt and Dirty Harry, this is one of the best of those gritty action movies that came out in the late 60s/early70s. Hackman's ""Popeye"" Doyle is blundering and borderline incompetent - ultimately more human than most movie cops, if not more sympathetic. Check out the sequel as well."

1.0,1000617-aliens,"Strong women, fierce creatures, slimy corporations, cute kids, terrifying horror, tense drama, explosive action, and belief-suspending science fiction: There is no other movie like it on earth or Acheron (LV-426)."
1.0,1000617-aliens,Not bad... for a human.
1.0,1000617-aliens,One of the best movies ever made. Almost as good as Blade Runner. Need I say more?
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Easily one of the best James Cameron movies. With fantastic action, this is one badass thrill ride. This and Terminator 2 prove why Cameron is the god of action sequences."

1.0,1000617-aliens,"Hard to find fault in this film, by far the strongest in the franchise. It's just another example of James Cameron being a master of sci fi action pictures. It's got a great storyline great cast and great visual effects. It's the one Alien film you can watch over and over."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"More of an sci-fi action flick than a sci-fi horror flick like it's predecessor, Aliens delivers an explosion of thrills that improves on the ideas of the first film."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Filled with great performances, gorgeous direction, and exhilarating action, Aliens is still one of the greatest Sci-Fi films ever made."
1.0,1000617-aliens,I would love to see a new one of this caliber!!!!
1.0,1000617-aliens,A superior action sequel better than than the first.
1.0,1000617-aliens,My one comment on this movie is as follows... take down Gene Siskel's lackadaisical attempt at writing a review on this timeless masterpiece.
1.0,1000617-aliens,One of the greatest films of all time.
1.0,1000617-aliens,Awesome sci fi horror movie!
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Aliens is one of the rare sequels that is even better than the original. By taking everything such as the masterful execution of suspense and character development, Aliens transcends being just a horror thriller but also a great action and drama movie as well."
0.0,1000617-aliens,"This is a very hard movie to get through, reminded me a lot of Avatar. How can this be that big a drop in quality from the original."
1.0,1000617-aliens,A great sequel to a ground breaking film! Riply is the most bad ass chick to ever hit the movie screen and she does not even mean to be bad ass either. The alien is one of the most unique creatures ever created.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Better than the original. Filled with more action than the first and somehow builds on an even better atmospheric story, and still has the same amazing effects as it's predecessor. Well James Cameron, I will accept you for some movies, and this shall be one of the movies."
1.0,1000617-aliens,best overall of the series.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"James Cameron is my favorite director, and possibly the best director of the 20th century. The detail he puts in this movie goes without saying."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Without argue, Aliens has made itself a big name compared to the original and brings you to a whole new scene of the same xenomorph monsters we always loved before!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"This is an outstanding movie. Moving, action packed and fast paced."
1.0,1000617-aliens,One of the best films I have ever seen. Loved every second of it.
1.0,1000617-aliens,It's some of the same formula from the last movie but comes off fresh with a new cast of more fleshed out characters (except ripely). Debatably this is a better sequel but it's unfair to compare the two because they are different genres but they are both fantastic movies.
1.0,1000617-aliens,The rise of Bill Paxton.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Excellent movie. For it's time it did exceptionally well with effect. Aliens used no CGI effect, it was all puppets and costumes - genius"
1.0,1000617-aliens,One of the best sequels ever made and a sci-fi horror action classic
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Thrilling roller coaster of a film that has a little bit of everything...sci-fi, horror action, gore...you name it, it's got it all tied up in a nice, tight package. Great acting, wild effects and great direction help make this the true classic it's become."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Once again,the even better sequel Aliens,gives us what made its original great ,and adding more with its colonial marines,strong performances,action packed,with its non-forgettable quote ""Its game over man,game over!"",and the weapons make this sequel worth the while to watch."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"A full blown science fiction classic. It was as great (albeit starkly different) as the first and far better than the rest in the series. The atmospheric tension, and surprisingly good acting made this film a roller coaster ride of thrills, kills, and big black aliens."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Faster paced than the first, but just as good. ""Aliens"" is once again a superb entry in the genre."
0.0,1000617-aliens,-: that fucking little girl...opposite of plot driven story telling. Everything seems so predictable and unnatural.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Game over man, Game over"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"while Alien was a masterpiece of a horror/ sci-fi film, Aliens was a masterpiece of an action/ sci-fi film. easily the best action movie ever made, with an original story that has been duplicated many times *cough* Halo *cough*"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"While ""Alien"" is a fantastic Sci-Fi Horror film, ""Aliens"" is a fantastic Sci-Fi Action film with horror elements. It's well directed, superbly acted, and more memorable than the original. Oh, and the Colonial Marines, really awesome!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"American classic enough said, but really what else is their to say about Aliens"
1.0,1000617-aliens,James Cameron not only reinvented the scifi horror of Alien but turned it into a heart stopping military action film with some of the most lovable soldiers ever put to film.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"A sharp contrast to the original (a roller coaster ride of action and violence, yet still intense and frightening, capped off with a legendary performance by Sigourney Weaver."

1.0,1000617-aliens,Amazing! With great special effects and exceptional acting. This is a great improvement over an outstanding preceder
1.0,1000617-aliens,"The best sequel of all time, James Cameron does the impossible and takes the atmospheric and heart pounding ""alien"" and makes it a fast paced thrill ride sequel."
1.0,1000617-aliens,Classic of our generation
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Truthfully, one of the best movies I've seen and arguably one of the best movies of its decade, while the killer performance Sigoueney Weaver blew me out of my socks, the plot development with the suspense mixed in, makes me say 5 stars!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Possibly the best movie ever made, in my opinion. For a movie from the 80's, this one had it all: actors, crew, effects, plot, action. Everything."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"The zenith of sci-fi films. Weaver eclipses her role once again, as Cameron takes the reigns in a more intense action directing with memorable moments and relatable characters."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Even better than the first, ""Aliens"" is just as creepy, but more intense and filled with memorable scenes, lines and tons of action."

1.0,1000617-aliens,"While not only scary, it's well written, perfectly action packed, phenomenally acted especially by Sigourney Weaver, and like it's predecessor, creative in terms of set design. Aliens stands very tall within the sci-fi film pantheon."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"In my all time top 5. Michael Biehn's ""Hicks"" character is right at the top of my all time favorite characters as well as performances. The movie holds up so well almost thirty years after it's release. Genius cinema."

1.0,1000617-aliens,"Another example of James Cameron making a superior sequel, Aliens is without a doubt an improvement by adding explosive action and gritty performances."
1.0,1000617-aliens,My favorite movie in the Alien series. Space Marines with super weapons versus vast army of savage Aliens!

1.0,1000617-aliens,I own this on DVD and on Blu-Ray in a four movie pack along with:* Alien (1979)* Alien3 (1992)* Alien Resurrection (1997)
1.0,1000617-aliens,This might be better than the first movie! :)
1.0,1000617-aliens,This movie is a great action movie. Classic. Love it! James Cameron's best work.
1.0,1000617-aliens,5/5 * An extremly effective action horror thriller that surpasses the original in some respects presenting the main lead as a horror iconic hero with visceral and emotional fury.

1.0,1000617-aliens,"Next best movie ever made... Game over man, Game over!!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"I actually had never seen this until last night. It was PHENOMENAL. Alien was good....a good solid horror movie. But this movie was just amazing. Ripley is a strong female leader, but she can be maternal as well. And the story....just....freaking....wonderful."
1.0,1000617-aliens,Classic. Badass female character taking on monsters. Intense and entertaining. Loved it.
1.0,1000617-aliens,Aliens throws intense action sequences into the mix and still retains much of the terror and horror from it's predecessor and both are surprisingly blended together magnificently. Aliens is a great sequel and an equally great movie.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"As James Rolfe (the AVGN) said, James Cameron can go to the grave knowing he made two of the best action sequels ever in cinema, one of which is ""Aliens."""
0.0,1000617-aliens,"Another shitty shitty movie. The action scenes are boring. There is no suspense. The ""military are bad"" theme is old and tired and not explored in any nuanced way here. The climax is hilariously awful. AJDSKFJDS"
1.0,1000617-aliens,Probably one of the best action movies ever made.
1.0,1000617-aliens,Best Sci-fi honor of all time.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"SIgourney. Ah, Sigourney. Sigourney, Sigourney, Sigourney."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"My second favorite movie EVER. Ripley is the Heroine every woman in movie/pop culture history (other then Princess Leia) wants to be. It's survival horror at it's grandest, it's just entertaining popcorn perfection."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Even better than the first, it's like the first was made just for this one. It's the action version of the first but also has just as many scares."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"A very different film than its predecessor, Aliens proves that taking a different road can sometimes be just what is fitting in a sequel"
1.0,1000617-aliens,Everything a sci-fi action movie should be.

1.0,1000617-aliens,"One of the most suspensful movies I've seen in my life; literally on the edge of my seat/yelling at the TV the entire movie. Great performance from Sigourny Weaver and easily the best in the series, took what was great about the first and improved on it!"

1.0,1000617-aliens,"There are two kinds of people in the world; people who prefer the movie Alien to Aliens and people who prefer the movie Aliens to Alien. And you can't go wrong with that. Just add a lot of cool action and suspense, with a plural to make an awesome sequel."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Awesome movie. Very tense, very suspenseful, very action-packed, with an excellent performance from Weaver."
1.0,1000617-aliens,One James Cameron's best films and the best film in the alien saga Aliens is one of many sequels that is better than the first and the big difference is that this film is action packed.
1.0,1000617-aliens,One of my all time favorite movies! A must see for any horror fan!
1.0,1000617-aliens,By far the best of the Alien movies. Sigourney Weaver comes back from the first film with a powerful persona while still having a maternal sense about her when it comes to dealing with her crew and the little girl.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Next to Terminator 2, this just might be the best sequel ever made!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"New direction, huge amount of aliens coming at the same time, makes this movie great entertainment movie.And James' direction, strong script, and Sigourney's acting, this movie also succeeded to be great drama."
1.0,1000617-aliens,Brilliant from start to finish. An all time favourite
1.0,1000617-aliens,In space no-one can hear you scream. In the movie theatre everyone will. I think this is the best in the series as seeing so many aliens then the queen is such a thrilling concept. Even better on blu-ray with the inclusion of MUTHUR mode.
1.0,1000617-aliens,All you need in a movie.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"In drastic contrast to the classic original, Aliens is classic in its own way. And by that I mean this is an action packed, extremely tense, and awesome film!"

1.0,1000617-aliens,"a sequel that actually develops the ideas from the first movie and doesn't just try to copy it. Cameron has made a few good films, this remains his greatest."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"best action movie ever made, and awsome effects. and the directing is great. but the girl so annoying when she screams but I would be screaming to if there was a alien in front of me lol"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Whereas 'Alien' was one of the best horror films ever, 'Aliens' is one of the best action movies ever made. With a terrific lead heroine, a great cast of memorable characters, and some excellent effects/action sequences, this is easily one of the best sequels ever made."

1.0,1000617-aliens,"One of the best Sci-fi movies of all time! James Cameron as always turns the movies he directs into cinema gold. Everything and everyone that helped produce, star and create this movie deserves a full A+ rating. They dont make movies like this anymore!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,Hands down the BEST science-fiction action film of the 20th century. AMAZING VISUALS and TERRIFIC PERFORMANCES as well as CREEPY SUSPENSE MASTERY elevates James Cameron to the top of my (and I'm sure everybody else's) list of top notch directors.

1.0,1000617-aliens,"Agree Agree Agree, This Movie Was Absolutly Badass"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"One of Cameron's best films, and a brilliant sequel to Alien, because it dared to do something different. i.e. Make a Vietnam film in space as opposed to the scary house style of the first. Ofcourse now it has been done to death, but Aliens stands the test of time."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Chilling and suspenseful, and doesn't rely too heavily on violence."
1.0,1000617-aliens,Great movie that keeps u at the edge of the seat.
1.0,1000617-aliens,Just as thrilling and incredible as the first.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"James Cameron writes and directs the sequel to Alien that has great action scenes, spectacular special effects, very memorable characters, and a amazing performance by Sigourney Weaver."
1.0,1000617-aliens,(Re-watched on DVD - 31 March 2013)
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Where the 1st 1 was more of a horror come thriller this one is more action come thriller...I have to agree with a lot of the comments on here that its very rare to see a sequal that is as good as or dare I say it , better than the 1st..."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"One my favorite movies of all time. Great action, believable characters plus Bill Paxton is funny."
1.0,1000617-aliens,Pretty intense hardcore sci fi. Starts out pretty slow but gets rolling fast. Lives up to its reputation as a a superior sequel.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Aliens isn't exactly a suspensful horror film like Alien, but it is a darn good science fiction-action film. It does everything a sequel is supposed to do and does it well."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"If you want to make a good sequal, always have more guns. Guns and action. Guns and blood. More of what you feared in the first movie is what makes a great 2nd movie. More action, more people to get killed and a bigger area. This is what Aliens had and its what made it better than the first."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"With amazing action sequences, brilliant effects work, and a strong, multi-dimensional lead character, 'Aliens' is action filmmaking at its finest."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"this movie surpasses the original alien, although alien is darker and scarier, aliens is faster paced, and has more action, and aliens"
1.0,1000617-aliens,Pretty much the best movie ever made. Ever.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"One of the best sequel of all time! James Cameron went deeper into alien mythology and delivers not only a good horror movie, but also a pure action movie. And when you see the Alien Queen you know one thing - you will get away from her (bitch)!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,Ripley jumps from a monster horror flick to a balls-out action movie with such a fluid transition you barely notice it happened. Cameron is right at home and at the top of his game.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"I actually have an old starlog magazine where the director talks about what scenes had to be cut from the story in the first movie and viola! they all ended up here. More action than suspense or horror, but still enjoy this movie."

1.0,1059489-wild_bunch,The best western ever. This movie makes you feel like that was the way it was in the old west.

1.0,captain_america_civil_war,Favorite out of the whole Captain America trilogy.
1.0,captain_america_civil_war,"I need six stars. Loved it.Loved the real tension between characters and worldviews.

1.0,sicario_2015,"A visceral, brutal, and beautiful film. This is really a masterful depiction of gang warfare and combines suspenseful action with great performances."
1.0,sicario_2015,A very strong movie tackling the moral issues of the war on drugs showing all stands people make to fught drugs with a spectrum that includes gray as well as black and white.
1.0,sicario_2015,Incredible film. The cast is on point and the story-line is near perfect. There are a few moments in this film that will leave you sweating and on the edge of your seat.
1.0,sicario_2015,"With expertly crafted, albeit, minimal set pieces, fantastically nuanced performances, and a tight script handled by a more than capable director, Sicario shows the dark underbelly of not only the Cartel, but the government with flying colors. This is the best thriller of the year!5/5 stars"
0.0,sicario_2015,This movie is very boring for someone who likes fast action and rapid changing scenes. This movie is very slow. The movie is more about the characters themselves than the actual story line. I don't recommend this movie if you like big action movies.
1.0,sicario_2015,One of the best movies I've ever seen.
0.0,sicario_2015,I watched because the ratings were so good...I can't believe this snooze fest got more than 1 star from anyone?

0.0,sicario_2015,"Dull, no sense of suspense, just a series of depressing events. The protagonist is written as a complete loser. She is not good at anything and loses over and over again and is a loser at the end. In addition, she is written as dumb. Who wants to watch 2 hours of that? Terrible."

0.0,sicario_2015,I have no idea why everybody loves and raves about this movie so much. I thought it was absolutely boring and ask the characters are overly acted pompous jack-asses. The whole time I was waiting for the movie to end.
1.0,sicario_2015,"A unique, slow burn, war on drugs film that is a masterclass of directing and cinematography. Featuring a breakout performance from Emily Blunt and one of the best performances Benicio Del Toro has ever given us. This is film is not quite what you expect and that makes it all the more better."
0.0,sicario_2015,"I'm the only one in my family that thought this was not a good movie. The film opened up with a lots of flash in attempt to draw you in, but after that the movie spiraled downward quickly. I lquit watching after and hour or so... It was one of the most boring movies I've seen in a long time."
1.0,sicario_2015,"Intense, adrenaline-rush action movie I've seen so far."
1.0,sicario_2015,One of those must-watch once and also Never-watch-again films. The first 40 minutes or so are prolly the best made storytelling I've seen in years. Great performances. Love Emily Blunt even more. Depressing though. Watch it if you're in the mood to see a good heavy thriller

1.0,sicario_2015,"Sicario is a disturbing, realistic depiction of the ongoing war between the U.S. and the Mexican drug cartels that should not be forgotten. Benicio Del Toro gives an Oscar-worthy performance alongside Emily Blunt and Josh Brolin, who both give excellent performances as well."

1.0,the_dark_knight,One of the best sequels ever made. Batman Begins was great but this was even better. Heath's Joker is the best and will always be the best one.

1.0,the_dark_knight,Heath Ledger's performance as the Joker is absolutely incredible. He really steals the show and elevates this movie beyond a typical superhero film. This movie really makes you think about good and evil and the choices you would make as the characters in the film.
1.0,the_dark_knight,Favorite movie of all time.
1.0,the_dark_knight,"Awesome movie. Some elements of the plot were confusing at first, however, but maybe that's because I'm not a hardcore Batman fan (like how Batman knew which cops were crooked at the hospital, until afterwards). Absolutely love all the technology and high tech stunts, gadgets, and concepts."

1.0,the_dark_knight,"Sequels are rarely as good as the original. That is not the case in this movie, where Nolan dives deeper into his dark take on the iconic Batman story. Heath Ledger's performance is well-deserving of the Oscar he received."

1.0,throne_of_blood,"10 out of 10:Beautifully filmed, well acted, and exciting, Throne of Blood makes the best adaptation of MacBeth."
1.0,throne_of_blood,One of the best Shakspearean adaptations takes place in feudal Japan. It's impossible to take your eyes off this awe-inspiring masterpiece.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"My second Kurosawa film based on a Shakespearean play. As much as I loved Ran, this i felt was better acted and flowed better as a film."
1.0,throne_of_blood,I shall taint these woods crimsom
1.0,throne_of_blood,A wonderful example of Japanese melodrama.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Not as good as ""Ran"", but Akira Kurosawa is truly the Great Lord of Shakespeare, even as he rests in his grave."
1.0,throne_of_blood,The film was beautiful!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A masterpiece, both as a Shakespeare adaptation and as a moving drama."
1.0,throne_of_blood,MACBETH WITH SAMURAI COULD YOU ASK FOR A MORE AWESOME MOVIE
1.0,throne_of_blood,Arguably the best adaptation of Macbeth ever made.
1.0,throne_of_blood,this is THE in in only Macbeth Film you habe to watch....
1.0,throne_of_blood,a truly masterful retelling of macbeth.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Brilliant in every way
1.0,throne_of_blood,Throne of Blood is my very own introduction to Shakespeare though not the first. The combination of Kurosawa and Mifune is simply unbeatable!
1.0,throne_of_blood,When my literature class of emo-flunkies rates this B&W; 1957 Shakespeare film over Branagh and Gibson...you know something's special about it. Kurosawa was never better and Shakespeare was never dignified as much on screen. Sorry Ken & Larry!
1.0,throne_of_blood,Pretty much perfect.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Haunting in the most visually appealing ways with impressive illusive effects seen in Kurosawa's films. Throne of Blood is very dark and spiritual with a great stage play brought to life. Also, and again, Mifune delivers."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"One of the most fresh, intelligent, visually-effective and purely magnificent takes on the old Shakespeare tale of deceit, greed, and bloodthirsty desires. Mifune and Yamada perform in the most striking and memorable way."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"The first time I saw it, at the end--when a certain forest literally started moving--I thought that Mr. Kurosawa had gone and changed the ending to the bard's play."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa is regarded as one of the great filmmakers of all time, and it's easy to see why. This is a majestic, enthralling film that reinterprets Shakespeare's Macbeth as a bold and truly epic Samurai picture. Hands down a contender for the best adaptation of the Bard ever put to film."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Best Macbeth adaptation ever. Should be a classic on everyone's shelf
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa's samurai retelling of Macbeth is brilliantly evocative and legend has it Mifune seriously risked his life making the ending. Repeated viewings make his villainous character appear more sympathetic.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Mifune again is superb as in Seven Samurai. This time the tradgedy of Macbeth translated into the Japanese medium and it is superbly handled. The ending is incredible and the film haunting from start to finish, Kurosawa's vision is beautiful, haunting and epic."
1.0,throne_of_blood,An amazing adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth. Set in feudal Japan with Kurosawa regular Toshiro Mifune masterly taking the lead role accompanied by by equally stunning screen performance by Isuzu Yamada as his wife. The ending has to be seen to be believed and has not been bettered to this day.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa's version of Macbeth---a feast for the eye--wonderful, a perfect movie, and true to the feeling of the original Shakespeare play"
1.0,throne_of_blood,A magnificent adapttion of the Shakespeare`s play!
1.0,throne_of_blood,It´s a must see! It´s shows how silence sometimes speaks louder than any word!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"The best version of any Shakespearian play on film, despite it being Macbeth transplanted to feudal Japan. Amazing in every respect!"
1.0,throne_of_blood,Amazing adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth. Probably a more Shakespearean film than nearly all the traditional movies of the bard's works. Must see.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Along with Seven Samurai, Kurosawa's best."
1.0,throne_of_blood,My only exposure to Shakespeare is through Kurosawa...
1.0,throne_of_blood,THRONE OF BLOOD (1957)
1.0,throne_of_blood,Perhaps Kurosawa's masterpiece.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Brilliant re-telling of Macbeth and one of Kurasawa'a best.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Toshrio MiFune is wonderful and just brilliant. and wow what an ending. officially in my three endings of all time
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Wonderful, robust classic Japanese retelling of ""Macbeth."" Beautifully filmed and boldly acted, with a chilling musical score. One of the greatest Shakespeare adaptations you will ever see."
0.0,throne_of_blood,I cared about Macbeth as a tragic figure. Washizu can suck arrow.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A Japanese classic, Kurosawa's adaptation of Macbeth."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"One of the very best Shakespeare adaptations. Akira Kurosawa not only retells the story to perfection but he also blends the themes of the original with his own themes and Japanese history, just as well as he did with his much later film Ran."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"The Shakespearean influence is obviously there, not only in story, but the film itself has a very theatre-esque feeling to it. The ending was fantastic. One of Kurosawa's best films."
1.0,throne_of_blood,A fantastic film adaptation of MacBeth's play in which fog and tangled forest webs emphasize the limits on man's foresight.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Macbeth set in feudal Japan, just brilliant. Mifune, as ever and I loved Isuzu Yamada as Lady Macbeth, still and emotionless steadily egging him on to his doom."
1.0,throne_of_blood,A brilliant adaptation on an epic scale.
1.0,throne_of_blood,The best film adaptation of Shakespeare ever. Incredible film.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"If theres a better film adaptation from a shakespear play (maybe Ran, but its a close call) than throne of bllod, I'd love to see it. Throne of blood is creepy, stunning, and masterfully made. Theres alot of depth behind the main characters, and its not just another re-telling of a shakespear play."
1.0,throne_of_blood,A great adaptation by Kurosawa of MacBeth. This movie will stand alone from other Kurosawa films because it is a different kind of story(with the exception of Ran)from the gunslinger fashioned ronin samurai.
1.0,throne_of_blood,A great adaptation of a great Shakespearian play. Stunning cinematography and acting. Very true to the play with only one significant change in the ending. But the change is (dare I say) better than the original. Recommended for anyone who likes Shakespeare.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Brilliant! Kurosawa's version of Macbeth in a samurai style.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Toshiro Mifune, Isuzu Yamada, Takashi Shimura, and Minoru Chiaki star in one of the many highlights of Akira Kurosawa's career."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"This fast, fun action film from legendary director Akira Kurosawa is a fascinating re-telling of Shakespeare's MACBETH, as set in feudal Japan."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Another masterpiece of a film by Akira Kurosawa. A fantastically unique take on Shakespeare's Macbeth starring the powerful force that is Toshiro Mifune.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Izvanredno. Ritam je jos bolji nego u Rashomonu, cini mi se. Uistinu dramatican film. Nema slabe tocke. Sad jos da procitam Macbeth..."
1.0,throne_of_blood,this movie rocked! I forgot how much I love kurasawa movies
1.0,throne_of_blood,so incredibly moody. fantastic performance by mifune.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"It's like watching the Psycho shower scene on repeat! So extreme and horrifying and messy, but so brilliant."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa never did any wrong when it came to making movies, especially with his favorite actor Mifune on his side."
0.0,throne_of_blood,"As much as I normally love Kurasowa, I just couldn't get through this. Maybe someday I'll give it another chance."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Arguably the finest cinematic adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth and one of Kurosawa's best films.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Better than Shakespeare!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa's best ever ! He highlighted perfectly the mystical dimension of Macbeth.Toshiro Mifune is amazing : a warlord returning from the battlefield to his homeland, fighting against his destiny ; against himself and his own craziness...Untill the end, which is totally apocalyptical."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"You put Toshiro Mifune, Akira Kurosawa, and a Shakespeare story together in a room and it's going to take a lot for it not to be fantastic."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Can Macbeth get any better than this? Loved the scene with the moving forest. Wow.
1.0,throne_of_blood,I love this film!!! There has never been a greater actor than Mifune Toshiro. Shakespeare should be proud.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A bona-fide Kurosawa masterpiece. Epic in its scope, its themes, its origins in Shakespeare and Noh theatre, and its lead performance by the walking supernova himself, Toshiro Mifune."
1.0,throne_of_blood,A brilliant adaptation of Macbeth set in feudal Japan. Incredibly directed by Akira Kurosawa. Absolutely stunning...which is to be expected from Kurosawa.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Probably the best adaptation of Macbeth put on screen. Kurosawa at his greatest and with powerhouse performances. The forest scene is absolutely unforgettable: the Bard would be ecstatic.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Simply sublime Cinema
1.0,throne_of_blood,By far the best version of Macbeth that I have seen. Toshiro Mifune is amazing in this role.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"to be(st ran) or not to be(st throne of blood), this is the question !!!!"
1.0,throne_of_blood,Great Kurosawa movie based on Macbeth. The final death scene was amazing and the special effects of the spirits are really cool too. The acting of Toshiro Mifune is always great. The costumes are pretty amazing too.
1.0,throne_of_blood,questions:you can act with just movement? the directors job is to anticipate human emotion? noh theatre: far is close?
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa turned Shakespeare's Macbeth into an amazing film!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A+. A version of Shakespeare's Macbeth, just in the samurai era."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Possibly the best film adaptation of Shakespeare ever. Definitely the best free interpretation, and the most cinematic."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa's compelling ""samurai"" adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth. This isn't just a typical retelling of the story or a film version of the stage play, this is much more of a character study with surprising depth and motivation. An epic film, in every sense of the word."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa's adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth. Stunning for it's time with a surreal feel to it and a story full of metaphors. A masterpiece.17 January 2009
1.0,throne_of_blood,"That evil spirit in the forest could have suggested Washizu get a divorce, but noooooo"
1.0,throne_of_blood,This is actually the first film by Akira Kurosawa that I have ever saw in my life. Kurosawa brilliantly combines the same human elements of Shakesphere's tragedy MacBeth with Japanese history.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A very moving and intense treatment of Shakespeare's Macbeth. Kurasawa was a master at translating Shakespeare into Japanese culture. Mifune is terrific. Very stylistic, though, and not for everyone."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Best Shakespeare adaptation ever (followed closely by 'Ran'). Mifune's final scenes in the film are cenima at its very finest
1.0,throne_of_blood,Easily the greatest screen adaptation of Macbeth (despite the plot adjustments)
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Not so much a tragedy as it is an unrelenting nightmare. I've always found Toshiro Mifune's acting to be somewhat exaggerated, but here his ferocious paranoia is perfectly suited to the role."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"My personal favorite among Kurosawa's film. Haunting, surreal and nightmarish, this is Kurosawa's darkest film yet. Mifune's best performance in my opinion."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"great atmosphere, love the human pincushion ending"
1.0,throne_of_blood,"If not for ""Seven Samurai"" this would be Kurosawas best film period."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa coordinates the best adaptation of Macbeth on-screen and Mifune is orgiastic in the lead role.What more can you ask when you're watching two legends dancing to the cinematic rhythm?
1.0,throne_of_blood,It's Kurosawa - It's Shakespeare. What else is there left to say!
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa. Mifune. Shakespeare. I don't know what else you want from here. Another one of my undisputed favorites.I wanna be buried with this movie.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Adaptacion cinematografica de ""Macbeth"" (Shakespeare), probablemente la mejor que se haya hecho. El teatro Kabuki y Noh construyen las actuaciones, y la ultima escena es una de las cosas mas impresionantes que un ser humano puede ver."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Greatest film adaptation of MacBeth. Dark and haunting. The visuals will stick with you for a long time.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Macbeth, Kurosawa style. Fantastic."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Akira Kurosawa's outstanding treatment of Shakespeare's MacBeth set in medieval Japan.

1.0,throne_of_blood,It's MacBeth with Samurais. It fooking perfect.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Haunting images and wrenching story make this a standout Kurosawa.
1.0,throne_of_blood,this is always worth another viewing!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Need I explain myself? This movie ""Kumonosu jo as it is called in Japanese is Akira Kurosawa's Magbeth! There can be no parellel to kurosawa in film history, and yes, this movie casts Toshiro Mifune."
1.0,throne_of_blood,The best Shakespeare adaptation I've ever seen. Kurosawa at his best without a doubt. The way that Kurosawa compensates for the language problems with the superb and subtle actions is genius.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurasawa directs Mifune in Japanese adaptation of the ""Scottish Play."""
1.0,throne_of_blood,Greatest finale ever? Maybe Mifune's finest performance.
1.0,throne_of_blood,A completely wonderful Shakespearian adaptation. One of Kurosawa's best. Toshiro Minfune is just amazing...as usual.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Throne of Blood is one of the few truly great movies that makes me excited for the possibilities of film rather than depressed at the failures.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"YES! YES! YES! Kurosawa's samurai version of Macbeth is beyond brilliant: creepy, surreal, beautiful, and riveting."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Akira Kurosawa's adaptation of Macbeth. VERY GOOD!

1.0,throne_of_blood,The best verison of Macbeth out there.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa's take on Macbeth. Gruesome, violent and superbly acted. This is one you will not forget. The Lady Macbeth character in this movie is a wonderful precursor to the one in RAN."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Just ONCE, I'd like to see Shakespeare set in medieval or Elizabethan England."
1.0,throne_of_blood,WOW! when Washizu's wife goes insane & starts freaking out that just put me on edge! And the ending Washizu's arrow scene is beyond cool. chalk up yet another Kurosawa film as one of my favorites...
1.0,throne_of_blood,"the story of macbeth set in feudal japan. . . seriously, can it get any cooler than shakespeare and samurai? or am i just a complete nerd?"
1.0,throne_of_blood,One of Kurosawa's best. Possibly the most visceral screen adaptation of shakespeare yet.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"This is Kurosawa's ""Macbeth"" . The language of Shakespeare is missing but the power, evil and terror are there. The ending is jaw-dropping. A reporter asked Mifune how he managed to look so terrified during the final scene. ""Because I WAS terrified,"" he answered."
1.0,throne_of_blood,I have seen many versions of Macbeth. Kurosawa did a wonderful job retelling the story in this samauri tale. Wow! Kurosawa never fails..
1.0,throne_of_blood,Best adaptation of Macbeth ever!

1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa's adaption of Shakespeare's ""MacBeth"" against a backdrop of feudal Japan is asbolutely genius. ""Throne of Blood"" is his second best film next to ""The Seven Samurai""."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa's adaption of Macbeth. Haunting in every way.

1.0,throne_of_blood,That last scene with the arrows! Holy crap.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"One of the greatest directors in history puts on to screen the work of the Bard. This is an epic film, but an amazing piece at the same time."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"If you have to watch Macbeth, I recommend this version, with all the samurai. Shakespeare should have had more samurai."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Yes. My favorite movie all time.
1.0,throne_of_blood,The visuals alone are worth the watching....
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Oddly, this is a scary-ass interpretation of Macbeth...Isuzu Yamada might be the scariest person in history."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"another unlikely yet fully successful mix. kurosawa's vision of macbeth is, as always, breathtaking."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Hommes trop faibles, femmes trop fortes... le pouvoir n'est jamais dans les mains de celui qu'on croit (Cf RAN pour confirmer cette histoire)."
1.0,throne_of_blood,It's Macbeth with samurai! My first and quite possibly favorite Kurosawa. Oh my science Toshiro Mifune is amazing.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa's Macbeth. Haunting and spectacular.
1.0,throne_of_blood,an obscenely subtle movie - shakespeare in a kabuki mask. one of my fav kurosawa films
1.0,throne_of_blood,Another Shakespeare insipred Kurosawa film.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"One of my favorite Kurosawa films, and one of my favorite Shakespeare adaptations. Maniacal Noh-inspired performances, ultra spooky sets and lighting, and a finale to make one quiver all over, so to speak..."
1.0,throne_of_blood,It's Macbeth in Japan. Phenomenal story and characters. If you know Shakespeare then this film is really fun to watch to see how everything is translated through
1.0,throne_of_blood,Shakespeare in Asia.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Just great shots and superb acting. Best adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth and one of the greatest Movies ever.
1.0,throne_of_blood,The most haunting ghost in any movie shows up here.
1.0,throne_of_blood,My second favorite cinematic adaptation of Shakespeare (right behind Strange Brew).
1.0,throne_of_blood,"This movie is so creepy and good--it's like Shakespeare should have been Japanese. I mean, it's amazing. Superb attention to detail; lots of authentic samurai garb and traditional Japanese music."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Yes it is Macbeth, and yes it is done right. You can really see Kurosawa's experiences as a painter show through in the chase scene with the witch."
1.0,throne_of_blood,awesome play of shadows!!!!!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa doesn't need one more person blowing smoke up his ass, but this is by far one of my favorite adaptations of Shakespeare. If you haven't seen it then you should, if you don't want to see it you're an asshole and should kill yourself."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"The final image of Kurosawa's Macbeth character, played by Toshiro Mifune, captures all that is tragic in the warrior-king. Another of Kurosawa's brilliant war films, Throne of Blood is the best reimagining of Shakespeare to come along until Ran, nearly thirty years later."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa's best film, in my opinion. One of his bloodiest, if not the bloodiest. I saw ""Macbeth"" on stage in London earlier this year and I think ""throne of Blood"" is the definitive retelling of that play. This film is breathtaking!"
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A great chance to see a master filmmaker and a world-class actor change everything you thought you knew about ... well, something that resembles Shakespeare."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Akira Kurosawa directs this amazing retelling of Macbeth. Toshiro Mifune (Washizu) is totally believable as the betrayer, while Isuzu Yamada (as Washizu's wife) is haunting as the distraught wife.There is no better production of Macbeth in any form than this movie."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Without a doubt my favorite Kurosawa film. Has everything that makes him great.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Shot beautifully, the contrasts are unreal, the portrayal of Yama-uba is horrifying. Truly great film."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa likes to create his own tales from others before him, and others do the same with Kurosawa's work, this time, he tackles Shakespeare and Macbeth. This is a fine masterpiece, its a great visual take and a deep powerful take rooted in the annuals of time."
1.0,throne_of_blood,the awesome toshiro mifune turned into a sieve in an amazing ending. great shakespeare!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Welles's was like a bad speed trip- - -sweaty, agit. Polanski gutted it, spilt blood. But Kurosawa, he spooked Macbeth up. Into hallucination, into ghost story, into fever dream. So he wins."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Its a really good and creepy interpretation of Macbeth. Its spooky!!!!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Stunning realisation - the fortress and battles, are stunning, in a typical Kurosawa stylee."
1.0,throne_of_blood,This is one of Kurasawa's best films. Haunting.
1.0,throne_of_blood,An astounding version of MacBeth. I have my dear brother to thank for introducing me to this master work.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Maybe my favorite Kurosawa film.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa tackles Shakespeare's MacBeth. A precursor to his masterpiece Ran is almost as visceral and intriguing. This is the coldest film I have seen by Kurosawa with one of the most powerful and well executed endings of his whole library.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Oustanding photography and filming
1.0,throne_of_blood,In my opinion this is one of the only two truly great film adaptations of Macbeth.

1.0,throne_of_blood,Great Japanese adaption of MacBeth. This is easily one of Toshiro Mifune's greatest works.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"amazing imagery. Toshiro Mufune finest moment. The ""Lady Macbeth"" character in her kimono slithering about like a snake was also amazing."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"One of the most perfect Macbeths I have ever seen - despite not having a scrap of Shakespeare in the script. Ferociously powerful, hauntingly believable brilliance."
1.0,throne_of_blood,A magnificent adaptation of that Scottish play (Macbeth)! One of Kurosawa's best!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A take on Shakespeare's Macbeth that captures the violent power of the story. It lacks the poetry of Shakespeare's verse, but the surreal imagery is a fine compensation. The scene in the Cobweb forest with the weird ""sister"" is so creepy. lovelovelove"
1.0,throne_of_blood,Japanese samurai version of MacBeth. Somewhat experimental and very classic.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa's best film, and the best Macbeth adaptation ever made."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Älskar samurajaction. Älskar Akira Kurosawa!
1.0,throne_of_blood,and i usually find shakespeare boring
1.0,throne_of_blood,Brilliant. A testament to the truth that Shakespeare's works reach their greatest heights when adapted rather than revered.
1.0,throne_of_blood,All i can say is WOW.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A brilliant adaption of macbeth, probably the best, even though it takes place in a japanese setting. Kurosawa tells the story in a dark and gritty manner, that it's thrilling and scary!"
1.0,throne_of_blood,Too bad it's not in color!!!
1.0,throne_of_blood,An amazing telling of the Macbeth story. I completely recommend this not just for the samurai movie fans but for the Shakespear fans as well.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa tries his hand at Shakespeare's Macbeth. The result is a massively entertaining film and one of the better Shakespeare adaptations out there.

1.0,throne_of_blood,"Mifune is the man! It's easy to see why he is one of Kurosawa's favourite actors in this electrifying performance. The ""human pin cushion"" death scene is incredible."

1.0,throne_of_blood,Competes for top position of a Shakespeare adaptation on film

1.0,throne_of_blood,Lady Macbeth at her most devious
1.0,throne_of_blood,"One of his real classics... the highlight is the way each frame is designed to communicate and awake all your senses... its composition, music and the costumes.."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Kurosawa brings his unerring eye for indelible images to Shakespeare in this 1957 adaptation of Macbeth. By changing the locale from Birnam Wood to 16th-century Japan, Kurosawa makes an oddball argument for the trans-historicity of Shakespeare's narrative. Amazing acting and soundtrack."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa's best movie IMO
1.0,throne_of_blood,"In my opinion, this film shows mifune at his finest. My favourite ever Shakespeare adaptation, only just beating Ran."

1.0,throne_of_blood,one of the best kurosawa i've seen yet. Brilliantly Created in most every aspect.
1.0,throne_of_blood,I first saw this movie in english class where we were studying Macbeth. I think Shakespeare himself would have been happy with this adaptation.

1.0,throne_of_blood,An amazingly rich adaptation of MacBeth that may be better than the original. The images are haunting and will stay with you for a long time.
1.0,throne_of_blood,The first kurosawa film I saw. Toshiro Mifune's face in the climactic scene will never leave me.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"One of Kurosawa's best. Also, it is one of Toshiro Mifune's best performances. God knows you can't beat the ending."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"The greatest screen version of Shakespeare I've ever seen (and I've seen too many...). Kurosawa's distillation of Macbeth captures the tautness and muscularity of Shakespeare's play brilliantly, and Mifune's performance is quite possibly his best."
1.0,throne_of_blood,The master himself amking one of the best Shakespeare adaptation to screen ever...I mean wow!
1.0,throne_of_blood,"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was a time of light, it was a time of darkness, Kurosawa exploring the duality of a mind and the versatility of life."

1.0,throne_of_blood,I think this may be Kurosawa's best Shakespeare adaptation.

1.0,throne_of_blood,"Now, that's a Lady M!"
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa retells Macbeth. Mifune brings it to life and risks his life (for real) to tell this tale. One of many movies that I believe everyone should see.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Shakespeare's Macbeth set in fuedal Japan, with suitable twists and cultural modifications to make this a genuine story all its own. The ending is superb. Now if only the real Macbeth were this interesting!"
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Visually its amazing, Mifune's acting is stark and so confident. This movie along with ""I Live in Fear"" just cements Mifune as my favourite actor. Its hard to pick a favourite Kurosawa film but this one keeps coming out on top. Its definitely his creepiest."
1.0,throne_of_blood,best ever shakespeare adaptation.
1.0,throne_of_blood,Amazing reworking of Macbeth. Breathtaking from start to finish.

1.0,throne_of_blood,Better than Shakespeare.

1.0,throne_of_blood,Macbeth by Kurosawa. A superb film with great acting
1.0,throne_of_blood,"A masterpiece of cinema, from the master Kurosawa. One of the greatest endings ever filmed."

1.0,throne_of_blood,"The best Shakespeare adaptation ever, and soooo much better than The Seven Samurai."
1.0,throne_of_blood,Kurosawa directs this best Shakespeare adaptation ever.Mifune stars as a man driven mad with power etc.The scene when the Trees come to life is still frighteningly real and effective. I have no idea how they pulled off an effect like that back in '57.
1.0,throne_of_blood,almost as brilliant as Kurosawa's more celebrated 'Rashomon'. it's almost impossible to fault this brilliant adaptation of Shakespeare's 'Macbeth'.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"In my opinion, Kurosawa's best film."
1.0,throne_of_blood,"If you're interested in Akira Kurosawa or Toshiro Mifune, start with this film. You'll be hooked."
1.0,throne_of_blood,My favorite Kurosawa film.
1.0,throne_of_blood,"Fukkin Ace! I'm no fan of Shakespear, but this movie is a fantastic adaptation of Macbeth. The quality of the movie is fantastic for its time! Beautiful cinematography, clever editing & the acting is superb. Deserving of all its awards this goes into my favourite movies list for sure."
1.0,iron_man,The one that started it all. Iron Man set the tone for what is now a juggernaut in Hollywood. RDJ throughout the series has the best character arc and we see how it all began right here. 5 Stars.
1.0,iron_man,"Iron man is an amazing, fun, visually stunning and superbly acted movie that leaves films like the infamous Howard the duck and captain America (1990) in the dust."
1.0,iron_man,Amazing! Iron Man is awesome! I highly recommend it!
1.0,iron_man,"the best way you could have started off the marvel cinematic universe, to make it better maybe have included antman in a later film to get the real and true aspect of how the avengers was put together."

1.0,iron_man,"Re-watching the MCU movies, and I think this first one might end up being one of the best! I had forgotten some of Iron Man's rad origin story, but not how insanely charming Robert Downy Jr. is Tony Stark - smart, sexy & funny. The CG is still impressive a decade later too."

1.0,iron_man,"A Great opening of the MCU ! This film was really good because it showed how did Tony Stark becoming Ironman, and how he tried to right his own wrong. The best origin story you can ask for a hero."
1.0,iron_man,Where it all began. Terrance Howard was pretty dumb to bail on the MCU over money. But in the end I like Cheadle better so it all worked out. Marvel knocked it out of the park with this one. I just wish we could have more Iron Man movies.

1.0,iron_man,"Such a fantastic movie. For a hero that is not as popular like Spider-Man, Hulk, The X-Men, Wolverine this turned out great. Among one of the best comicbook movies. I am sure part 2 will be on top to."
1.0,iron_man,Not since Christopher Reeve has some one played a comic book superhero as flawlessly as Robert Downey Jr plays Iron man.
1.0,iron_man,Just... so fucking cool.
1.0,iron_man,"Great movie. Very cool, pretty funny, and led by an awesome performance from Downey Jr."
1.0,iron_man,This film started it all and did really well at doing it. Robert Downey Jr is great as stark and all the action and story is great
1.0,iron_man,"It's exactly what we're looking for - an original, intelligent and inventive sci-fi action movie. With a healthy and entertaining dash of humour. Love it."
1.0,iron_man,"Funny, smart, and very well performed from Downey Jr. The best superhero movie to it's date, and aside from perhaps 'The Avengers', the best ever."
1.0,iron_man,Again if u love marvels franchise this is a must see pluss its got Robert downey Jr. So it was going to be good nobody else could possible play the role
1.0,iron_man,"The first movie of the Marvel Cinematic Universe ""Iron Man"" has succeeded very well and introduces me about the characters and a very good origin story about the hero himselfHe is now one of my favourite super heroes of all time!!"
1.0,iron_man,one of my all-time favorites
0.0,iron_man,The iron man series puts me to sleep.
1.0,iron_man,De lo mejor que Marvel ha elaborado
1.0,iron_man,"Ohhh, what can I say? The best movie of Marvel Cinematic Universe. And my favorite Comic Book movie."
1.0,iron_man,"Robert Downey Jr. Is an example of an actor who has beaten his demons, and rebuilt himself as a A-List actor, and it all began with this film. He is terrific playing Tony Stark, the wealthy, somewhat narcissIstic playboy who eventually becomes the titular Iron Man."
1.0,iron_man,Part 2 and 3 can't even compare to this original. Producers made Iron Man a laughing stock. Balance it out and make it serious as well.
1.0,iron_man,Probably the best Marvel movie there will ever be.
1.0,iron_man,"this is actually my favorite comic book movie. it makes you feel like you to could make an iron man suit. plus it makes you really want to have one. honestly, this is the only movie in the iron man trilogy worth watching more than once."
1.0,iron_man,This movie was great!
1.0,iron_man,it is a very exciting action marvel movie
1.0,iron_man,"A good movie doesn't just make for a good moment, but inspires you to greatness. Worst part of this movie is that it's taking a page from my childhood daydreams. They even got the cliffside house right! Well, now you know."
1.0,iron_man,"Totally enjoyable, fun, high-octane summer blockbuster. Possibly the best super-hero movie I've ever seen. Downey, Jr. is superb and I have to admit, I like Gwyneth with a little meat on her bones. Highly recommended."

1.0,iron_man,"absolutely fantastic, left me on the edge of my seat"
1.0,iron_man,One of the best comic book movies...
1.0,iron_man,Iron Man is the best Marvel has to offer and is a great origin story for the character of Iron Man.

1.0,iron_man,good movie like the storyline
1.0,iron_man,"If you're going to set out to create a cinematic universe, then you could do worse than have this be your first foray. By turns jaw-droppingly awesome and laugh out loud funny, this is practically pitch perfect throughout."
1.0,iron_man,A brilliant exciting film! Wow!
1.0,iron_man,iron man is awesomeness
1.0,iron_man,"Absolutely in love with RDJ in this role. I don't think I could ever get sick of watching him as Tony Stark. I'm also very fond of Terrence Howard's as Rhodey, and as much as I love Don Cheadle, this version of Rhodey remains my favorite."
1.0,iron_man,"Hillaurious, action packed and with a in depth story that will be expanded in more than just sequels this an exciting start to what can be an excellent franchise."
1.0,iron_man,Robert Downey Jr. makes Iron Man/Tony Stark COOL! Talk about an actor making a movie.. WOW! One of the best super hero movies I've ever seen!!
1.0,gojira,"It never falters, delivers on all of it's promises, and has an entertaining and very mind-absorbing plot, which bears more meaning than most of us can possibly even imagine. But in the end, one thing's for sure, and that is that this is Godzilla, and he has never. . . ever. . . been better."
1.0,gojira,"holds up very well. top 10 movie. analogy of nuclear war. haunting with a guy in a rubber suit, how do you pull that off with such a great visual ad aural movie?!"
0.0,gojira,I thought this movie was boring. I dont get how Godzilla became such a huge thing if this was the original.
1.0,gojira,My favorite movie ever
1.0,gojira,"A timeless classic that dealt with nuclear issues, still relevant today."
1.0,gojira,A good deal of time in my childhood was spent watching Godzilla movies. I loved the campy ones back then but have developed an appreciation for the original as I have aged.
1.0,gojira,"Good film, great story, great lesson and is full of action"
1.0,gojira,I LOVE GOJIRA!!!!!!!
1.0,gojira,"This is my favorite movie of all time. Gojiras suit is really menacing and he just looks real Ishiro Honda can make movies, sadly people think the new Godzilla movies are better but in my opinion this is the best."
1.0,gojira,"A cinematic masterpiece, historical movie treasure. This film is awesome. Special effects are tremendous. The use of miniature models is superb. Night scenes with Godzilla photographed flawlessly. Social message is strong and clear given the dark times of the postwar world and a fear of nuclear war."
1.0,gojira,I was delightfully surprised by the human elements in this movie. It's one of the rarest horror movies to make me sympathize sincerely for humanity.
1.0,gojira,100/A+. One of the best postwar commentary and anti nuclear films. Yes it's the same movie with a guy in a giant lizard costume destroy miniature sections of Tokyo and toy military vehicles.
1.0,gojira,The original Godzilla film is a masterpiece of Japanese cinema!
1.0,gojira,"The most iconic movie from Japan, Godzilla or Gojira is a impact of cinema with it's classic technology of a man in a rubber suit. So satisfying to see destruction at it's best!"
1.0,gojira,"Spectacular, deeply political, and emotionally moving artwork!!"
1.0,gojira,Great Movie with a great message about the atomic weapons
1.0,gojira,Best monster from Japon and one of my favorites.
1.0,gojira,A masterpiece. Both very dark and very haunting.

1.0,gojira,One of the best monster movies.
1.0,gojira,"One of, if not the best monster film ever made, great film, second, in my mind only to Jaws"
1.0,gojira,You Rottentomatoes people need to give this movie a 100% postive.
1.0,gojira,Great with the actors treating this as a natural disaster
1.0,gojira,A timeless classic! Nothing else to say but you need to watch this!
1.0,gojira,The roaring granddaddy of kaiju films.
1.0,gojira,A truly epic and dramatic piece of Japanese cinema.
1.0,gojira,"If you're uninitiated, I can almost guarantee that the tone of the third act will surprise you, even if you aren't impressed by Tsuburaya's now archaic, but nevertheless ingenious effects"
1.0,gojira,My absolute favorite film ever made
1.0,gojira,Probably the best monster movie ever made.
1.0,gojira,The very first and best godzilla movie ever made and it came 60 years ago
1.0,gojira,Amazing! Best Monster Film Alltime
1.0,gojira,"Not a classic monster movie. The classic monster movie. It may not be my exact number one favorite Godzilla, but its close. This is an amazing and intriguing movie. It's dark and somber and its not to be missed."
1.0,gojira,One of the greatest monster movies of all timeGreat acting that makes feel for the character Great effects (for its time)Great cinematography And great soundtrack that will last forever
1.0,gojira,The original masterpiece Gojira. It's potent and has impact and is a classic for a reason.
1.0,gojira,"Devastating, enthralling, and actually quite frightening; Gojira is a biting piece of post-war commentary and as timeless as it is politically astute."
1.0,gojira,Man in rubber suit tramples on matchstick models of Tokyo as denizens look up in terror. The original Godzilla is all that and more. The original Godzilla is far different from the tag team slogfests that followed. Much imitated (I'm talking about you Jurassic Park) but rarely bettered.
1.0,gojira,"Even after all these years, it's still a great movie."
1.0,gojira,"Gojira(Godzilla) is a film of great suspense, brilliant storytelling, amazing effects(for time) and spectacular characters. These factors and more make this my personal pick for the greatest movie of all time."
1.0,gojira,"While the special effects are dated, it still holds up to this day as the best monster movie of all time, offering emotionally gripping human drama that provides a chilling realistic atmosphere. It all builds up to an epic third act that will forever leave us questioning our ethics and morals."
1.0,gojira,original definitely a classic monster movie
1.0,gojira,A chilling masterpiece deserving of a 60 year (and counting!) franchise
1.0,gojira,ohhhh the original was so corny but awesome

1.0,gojira,The amazing birth of the most iconic monster in film history
1.0,gojira,"A Product of the Times, Yet Also Far Ahead of it's Time, Godzilla (or Gojira) remains as a staple of the monster movie, and one of the few to truly take advantage of it, dated, yet timeless, it's a movie that stands as tall as it's title monster"
1.0,gojira,One of the greatest monster movies ever. Genuinely scary too.
1.0,gojira,Godjira is one of the few 1950s monster films that has managed to stand the test of time. It is fantastic!

1.0,gojira,Perfection! Awesome atomic warfare allegory!!! Brilliant!!! So thought-provoking!!!
1.0,gojira,A master peice by every definition of the word. It truly brings to life the horrors of nuclear war and is much more serious and gritty in tone than the more campy sequels of the 60's and 70's. Looking forward to the new one coming may 2014!
1.0,gojira,This movie is Beautiful. A masterpiece. More than a monster movie
1.0,gojira,Gojira is more than your average monster flick; it shows the suffering and pain of a nation that experienced first hand the horrors of the atomic age.

1.0,gojira,Incredible and great. Gojira has a great story and its monster was ficious.
1.0,gojira,"Possibly my favorite monster movie of all time. Godzilla looks menacing and the gritty, black-and-white cinematography and the dark tone makes the destruction of Tokyo look that much more catastrophic."
1.0,gojira,"Every manga, every anime, every cartoon, every movie that deals with monsters has its foundation and influences based around this one iconic monster."
1.0,gojira,"Everyone knows Godzilla, it's a fact. This is the film that started it all, with a strong Anti - Nuke message and a hell of a lot of destruction. It is easy to see why this movie is a cultural icon!"
1.0,gojira,Manages to be a bleak and effective allegory while at the same time being a fun monster movie.
1.0,gojira,"DVD Original, Theatrical"
1.0,gojira,"A great entry in science fiction cinema worldwide. From beggining to end, it is amazing to watch. It takes itself much more serious than what the average person might suppose, and it's a definite ""must-see"" for any sci-fi fan."

1.0,gojira,Beautiful! Rich! Moving! Gojira!
1.0,gojira,"More than just a monster movie, a great social commentary. For those who think the idea of a man in a rubber suit is stupid, it looks far more realistic than CGI! What a classic movie, I enjoy it more every time I watch it."
1.0,gojira,"One of the most incredible movies of all time. No, really. It's far beyond the cheesy 60's Godzilla and totally takes it seriously. As well, its far better than even the U.S. Raymond Burr version. As good, if not better, than the classic King Kong, and deserving of much more appreciation."
1.0,gojira,"Groundbreaking monster film, that tells of the dangers of nuclear bombs. Deals with serious issues via a form of entertainment. Great classic film."
1.0,gojira,Unexpectedly depressing and emotionally resonant. A franchise that turned into silly fun started out as a fascinating anti-war masterpiece.
1.0,gojira,The Classics can never go out of hand. 4 Stars! check it out if you are a godzilla fan!
1.0,gojira,"Truly one of the greatest foreign films ever. It breaks the mold of what a monster movie can be, and started a whole legacy of its own. One of my all time favorites."
1.0,gojira,"On the surface 50's monster B-movie, underneath allegory for war and nuclear weapons. Corny and cheesy at times, it is also haunting and terrifying when it needs to be. This movie pretty much launched the kaiju and tokusatsu film industries in Japan."
1.0,gojira,Stunning japanese masterpeice.
1.0,gojira,Easily one of the best monster movies ever made. The movie looks great in black and white and has nice charm to it. This movie had good special effects for the time and is very enjoyable.

1.0,gojira,The origianl that shows the beautiful classic affects of Eiji Tsubaraya. And doens't feature perry mason to ruin it.
1.0,gojira,This is a great monster movie that goes beyond the typical campy stuff and actually tells very dark tale with a powerful message about war and its affect on humanity.
1.0,gojira,men in rubber monster suits... this is what classic movie making is ALL about
1.0,gojira,This film got me into Godzilla. Plain and Simple.
1.0,gojira,Classic monster movie. It has never grown old for me.
1.0,gojira,"This is my FAVORITE Godzilla movie, I like it more than final wars. Why? Because it starts the legend of Gojira (Godzilla)"
1.0,gojira,"Absolutely astounding. No other film in the series (with the exception of Return of Godzilla) captures the power and horror of the beast. He is the bomb, and while watching his destruction of Japan, you start to believe it"
1.0,gojira,"If you've only seen the American re-edit, then you haven't seen Godzilla. This one packs an emotional whallop!"
1.0,gojira,As much as I love the Burr version (and I do) the original Japanese version of Gojira (Godzilla) is an absolute masterpiece. It truly captures the horrors that Japan suffered in the aftermath of the atomic bomb.
1.0,gojira,"Godzilla is the man, The beginning of a 50 year monster icon."
1.0,gojira,This is a MASTERPIECE
1.0,gojira,"The original Japanese masterpiece, as it was meant to be seen. Yeah, the American version is a nice 50's monster movie, but this version transcends beyond that, and it's message can be heard for modern audiences at last."
1.0,gojira,"Gojira aka Godzilla (1954) is THE greatest monster movie ever made, and if you can get passed the 50 year old low budget effects you'll see the way Godzilla was meant to be seen"
1.0,gojira,The Japanese version is better than the American (Raymond Burr) version.
1.0,gojira,"A Frankenstein fable for the atomic age, supported by brilliant acting (yes! in a Godzilla movie) and ingenious lighting make this Kaiju classic no laughing matter."
1.0,gojira,"Very dark, and sometimes scary, especially layered shots of Godzilla and the people running at his feet. Very moving, and heavy. Akira Ifikube's score is incredible, and makes the film work. An excellent cast, and compelling story make this a deep impact in cinematic history."
1.0,gojira,"After so many years and so many viewings this film hasn't lost a bit of power or effect. It stands above the rest not because it was the first in the Godzilla series, but because it experiments heavily with a narrative style that resembles what we call cutting edge today."
1.0,gojira,"I'm serious, Godzilla has balls. Other movies go great with Megadeth!"
1.0,gojira,Easily the best monster film ever.
1.0,gojira,The most powerful most moving most purposeful Godzilla movie and the first of them all

1.0,gojira,The original! Watch the Japanese version to understand the movie better.
1.0,gojira,"THE monster movie of the 20th Century - though also much more. As dark and disturbing a nuclear allegory today as it was in 1954, GOJIRA is, quite simply, a masterpiece."
1.0,gojira,"This movie is a masterpiece. It is more than just a monster running loose film, it is a terrifing reminder of the horrors of nuclear weapons and testing. Seeing a mother huddled in rumble with her two children, telling them they will all be with daddy soon, is heart wrenching in a horrifing manner."
1.0,gojira,Fantastic. Puts a smile on my face every time.
1.0,gojira,"The original Godzilla was a horror movie with no pretense of good and evil, simply the mind-numbing destruction of a man-made force."
1.0,gojira,The one that started it all - deep amazing and moving - this is not just a guy in suit this is a real film a cry against the arms race and the maddness of war. (not that guy in the suit films are bad).
1.0,gojira,The Classic! You Must See!!!
1.0,gojira,One of the best monster movies ever - especially the uncut Japanese original.
1.0,gojira,Nuclear weapons are bad. Movies with big giant fire breathing monsters on a rampage are awesome.  I really want to watch the rest of the Godzilla movies now.
1.0,gojira,This is the original Japanese edit without all the American crap with Raymond Burr sliced in. It's so much better!!
1.0,gojira,This is the best monster movie ever made. It is simply amazing.
1.0,gojira,"The absolute pinnacle of monster movies. This is the measure by which all others are weighed, measured, and found wanting."
1.0,gojira,I love all the TOYO Godzilla films ... but here it started. Even better is the real original version sans Raymond Burr
1.0,gojira,"The first one, and definitely one of the greatest. The original Japanese version, this one, is FAR superior to the Americanization with Raymond Burr. Scarier, too."
1.0,gojira,"Just... too... awesome. This is the kind of monster movie I grew up with, in fact it's the king of them all. It also has a great meaning behind it."
1.0,gojira,This is the one that started it all. The original Japanese cut that is more powerful than the American cut. A classic to change people's view on giant monster movies.

1.0,gojira,best science fiction film made in japan and the best of the series of godzilla

1.0,gojira,Top notch sound effects and costumes! A++
1.0,gojira,The Japanese version is better than the American if you don't mind subtitle.
1.0,gojira,"After growing up with the silly American re-working of this film and eventually discovering the original on a low-quality bootleg copy of a copy, it's wonderful to finally have a proper version of this film in my collection."
1.0,gojira,"Sad, unflinching and potent."
1.0,gojira,The first and Still the best.
1.0,gojira,"the ultimate classic that spawned more than 20 sequels and made monster movies what they are today. every monster after this was modeled after godzilla, but you gotta love the big ol lizard. if your a fan of him, you have to have seen this movie. its where it all started."
1.0,gojira,One of my favorite films of all time
1.0,gojira,This is the original un-cut Japanese version which is much longer and more in-depth than the heavily cut American Version.
1.0,gojira,"One of the greatest movies ever made, finally released in America in it's unsanitized version. Even my father, who self identifies as a right wing Republican, loved it when we sat down and watched it together. Watch it with a friend, you'll have something to talk about at the end."
1.0,gojira,The greatest move ever filmed. The true king of all movies.
1.0,gojira,"It's a masterpiece, I am proud of tha t this film affected famous directors after all. It's classic but still better than the remake in Hollywood"
1.0,gojira,Definitely a masterpiece. Groundbreaking filming techniques make this movie a must see for any science fiction fan.
1.0,gojira,great. i didn't think the first godzilla movie would be smart
1.0,gojira,Much more grittier and gripping than the dubbed American version with Raymond Burr. Japanese movies also sound more serious in the original Japanese.
1.0,gojira,"Back when Godzilla movies were serious. Basically, an allegory for the A-Bomb. Also, the greatest giant monster movie of all time."
1.0,gojira,"The original Godzilla, and the only good one. More a social commentary then a monster flick, this movie is compelling and beautifully filmed. One of my favorited movies since I was about 3."
1.0,gojira,"Way betterthan the Americanized bastardization of it. The metaphor was straightforward, yet moving nonetheless."
1.0,gojira,It is an all time classic plus the start really of all the big monster movies. Plus it is one of the better Godzilla films too.
1.0,gojira,A seriously great monster movie.
1.0,gojira,Accept no substitutes.
1.0,gojira,Accept no substitutes.
1.0,gojira,"Do not watch the American cut, accept only the original source of all our terrors, the one and the original. Everyone who made this movie would have PERSONAL connections to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and THIS is their story, a film which has no peers."
1.0,gojira,Haunting and Original! This flick is more than just a monster movie. It packs a real message about the dangers of nuclear weaponry and will no doubt leave you in tears.
1.0,gojira,A short review..if you have never seen a Godzilla movie.THis is the one you should see
1.0,gojira,"Say what you want about the sequels, but don't make fun of this one. It actually succeeds at being serious and bleak."
1.0,gojira,THE greatest monster movie ever made. And that is not an opinion.
1.0,gojira,Pure classic. If only there were more movies like this.
1.0,gojira,Total Classic...I tend to not like monster movies but this is like few others. A lot of politcal comentary in this one.
1.0,gojira,"The classic, the one that started it all and really deserving of classic status, but only the Japanese version not the inferior American version."
1.0,gojira,"For being 1954, spectacular effects, also makes you think about the effect of nuclear weapons. The line from the song godzilla comes to mind. ""History shows again and again how nature points to the falling of man."""
1.0,gojira,"screw Jaws and The Host, this is the best monster-on-the-loose flick ever made, AND a poignant statement about the horrors of war. if you can see the original Japanese version you'll never look at men in suits the same way again."
1.0,gojira,"The Rolls Royce of monster movies, ""Gojira"" is simply a legendary classic."
1.0,gojira,"Possibly the most brilliant and deep monster movie ever, ever. If you've only seen the american version, this is a totally different film."
1.0,gojira,"The original 1954 version is much more in depth than many would be lead to believe, and Akira Ifukube's score is stellar. The American version while butchered is still pretty good."
1.0,gojira,see the original version from japan. It is awesome.
1.0,gojira,"Both versions are great. I think comparison between the two is unnecessary, now that they are sold together. The original is great, Burr is great too. He really knew how to ""serious"" it up! Godzilla used to be scary; but was always fun!!"
1.0,gojira,a landmark in cinema history. incredible movie. one of the best movies ever made.
1.0,gojira,the original is always the best
1.0,gojira,"The 1954 Japanese version is a masterpiece with an obvious allegory and symbolism to WWII and the atomic bombings in Japan. Oh, and the U.S. version is still pretty fun."
1.0,gojira,"The original 1954 masterpiece, and it's FAR different from it's many sequels and imitators. Brilliantly done, and the symbolism is powerful."
1.0,gojira,"""Just go and watch it dammit!!!"""
1.0,gojira,More than a mere monster movie with a guy in a rubber suit smashing cardboard buildings and model tanks and planes. An artful and somber allegory to WWII and the atomic bomb. See this before the American version. It's better.
1.0,gojira,If you don't like this...you aren't a real person. Gojira forever.
1.0,gojira,The Original -and The Best.
1.0,gojira,"Although the effects are dated, the movie remains a compelling allegory for nuclear warfare. While it's not the goofiest, it's the best ""Godzilla"" film. Akira Ifukube supplies a pulse-pounding score."
1.0,gojira,"The one that started it all. If you are a serious Big G fan, you'll watch both. If not, avoid the campiness and watch the original Japanese version. It's more enjoyable."
1.0,gojira,The one that started it all. Japan's allegorical piece about nuclear weapons which would be the foundation of an unlikely long lived franchise.
1.0,gojira,Very underrated. Actually has some very moving scenes and a real message and point. Essential to see the original Japanese version.
1.0,gojira,"A man in a rubber-suit, do I need to say more?"
1.0,gojira,"The beginning of the greatest series of films, ever."
1.0,gojira,Best monster movie. Ever.
1.0,gojira,most people see a giant rubber suit . . . those people are fucking retarded
1.0,gojira,basically the best giant monster film on earth
1.0,gojira,The ultimate giant monster movie. The American version (Godzilla: King of the Monsters) is passable but misses the point.
1.0,gojira,Japanese version all the way! How it was meant to be seen.
1.0,gojira,Godzilla rocks!!!!!!!!! I have loved this movie since I was a little kid!
1.0,gojira,One of the best Japanese films ever made. This is the one that started it all.
1.0,gojira,"The greatest movie ever made. I've seen it over 3,000 times!!!!"
1.0,gojira,Hauntingly beautiful anti-nuclear movie.
1.0,gojira,"Not only a great monster movie, Gojira is a powerful allegory for the atomic age from the one nation that knows the true horror of atomic power."
1.0,gojira,Its Godzilla whats not to like
1.0,gojira,"Godzilla's darkest and perhaps crowning hour, one that represents the monster as not only a city destroying fiend but a threat to man's very extistence. As many other reviews have said the undercurrents of this movie are very deep and potentially very disturbing as well."
1.0,gojira,"Even better in the original Japanese version- Find out how they REALLY feel about us and our ""devices"""
1.0,gojira,"The ORIGINAL!!! No Raymond Burr, etc.."
1.0,gojira,"I was a fan when I was a kid, but I am sticking with this film especially because it is incredible, given that it is from 1954. With the effects they had at the time, this is by far one of the best movies ever made."
1.0,gojira,"very good, very sad, anti war and nuclear weapons movie"
1.0,gojira,This is the very first Godzilla movie for the period it was one of the best post war (WW2) films ever done. The original is a must see. Hands down.
1.0,gojira,"The best G-film period and also a landmark for Horror and Sci-Fi. This film paved the way for other Japanese films, shows, and games to become popular. A film that will go down in history."
1.0,gojira,"The best Godzilla film is the original. unlike every movie after this one, this is genuinly a good movie. (I do like all the other movies, but lets be real, their cheesy as hell.) This movie is full of symbolism about nuclear weapons. I urge everyone to see this movie."
1.0,gojira,"Not what you would expect from the King of the Monsters. This is him before the fame and foes acting as an analogy. a statement in post war Japanese fear and anxiety, a horror of it's time and classic of ours"
1.0,gojira,"Best monster movie, ever. Some of the camerawork is truly brilliant, and Godzilla is a great commentary on post-Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan."
1.0,gojira,"The best Godzilla by far. Its raw film making doesnt patronise the viewer like most modern movies, allowing the simple effects, storyline and atmosphere work its magic."
1.0,gojira,The quintessential Japanese monster movie.
1.0,gojira,The movie that started it all. This movie i saw when i was a little kid and got me into the whole moster movie thing. I have been a fan every since and this movie captivates everything that is amazing about the original movie monster.
1.0,gojira,Do yourself a favour and look past the fact that there's a man in a lizard suit and don't let yourself miss this timeless sci-fi classic! It's was the catalyst for the giant monster movie and also drives home a deeper message about the horrors of nuclear weapons.
1.0,gojira,"The original, the classic. The one that started it all."
1.0,gojira,Great Nuclear Message without all the American Bastardizations.
1.0,gojira,One of the greatest films of all time
1.0,gojira,I've never quite gotten over this movie.
1.0,gojira,"The quintessential giant monster film. Arguably the only one in the genre that can be considered a masterpiece of cinema. Dark and somber in tone, with tons of subtleties. Easily on par with the best the movie world has to offer. Also, giant monster smashing shit."
1.0,gojira,The lack of respect given to this movie and Ishiro Honda sickens me.
1.0,gojira,EXCELLENT. I finally have seen the REAL version. And I loved it.
1.0,gojira,The original. Nothing more to say.
1.0,gojira,Best monster movie of all time.
1.0,gojira,"Finally, America gets to see the origonal film that made Godzilla a ledgend"
1.0,gojira,"It is the undisputed king of all monster movies, a dark and deeply disturbing metaphor for the monster that is American hubris."
1.0,gojira,"They should do a remake, but not like the one they already made. A japanese remake. 'Twould be sweet."
1.0,gojira,"Not just a fantastic monster movie, that's just the selling feature. It's a fantastic anti-war/anti-nuclear movie depicting scenes of struggle and hardship much like the aftermath of Hiroshima."
1.0,gojira,Legendary! That's all you need to know!
1.0,gojira,"Possibly the best monster movie made. Must have been chilling to see only 10 years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the anti-nuclear arms race message is much clearer in the original version."
1.0,gojira,"This is one of my favorite movies. A terrific anti-war film, one that could only have been made in postwar Japan. And, of course, it brought us the immortal character of Godzilla."
1.0,gojira,"A tense and terrifying monster movie, yes, but also a touching requiem for the horrors visited by World War II, and a call for nobility and self-sacrifice to return in the post-war age."
1.0,gojira,"The original, and best Godzilla is the most serious, dark and depressing of the series with an anti-war message that is as clear today as ever. Very strong characters and thought provoking writing lead this monster masterpiece."
1.0,gojira,My most favorite movie of all time. Not only is it about a giant monster destroying everything it also has a deep and inspiring message. To top it all off there's no Steve Martin. This started a life long obsession for these films.
1.0,gojira,Classic Japanese horror/sci-fi movie. I could sit through a 1000 of these things. I Love this stuff!
1.0,gojira,"Don't see Godzilla, see Gojira."
1.0,gojira,Perhaps the most misunderstood movie of all time. The Japanese version is without question a cinematic milestone.
1.0,gojira,"By far the best godzilla movie, especially the original japanese version without the american scenes in.Definately a defining moment in cinema history."
1.0,gojira,The original and best monster movie ever made.
1.0,gojira,Classics are the best not some movie remade over and over to make money...whom ever made this had something to get across to other people. obviously the attact on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But even in it seriousness still a great movie.
1.0,gojira,This movie pretty much changed my life. I like the original Japanese and Raymond Burr versions for different reasons.
1.0,gojira,"It's a classic and upon recent repeat viewings, an actual movie with characters and emotion and stuff. That was a nice surprise after watching every single other Godzilla movie."
1.0,gojira,Best Kaiju movie ever...hands down!
1.0,gojira,"The original Kaiju film as only Ishiro Honda could have told it. Here Godzilla is a tragic character, an animal who is trapped in a hostile world of technology that is not his own. Gojira is both an amazing and poignant film. That is, unless Raymond Burr comes around."
1.0,gojira,This is probably the best of all the Godzilla movies. I had to buy it when i saw the new DVD. This movie is too good for anyone to miss out on. It is a classic.
1.0,gojira,"The original Kaiju film as only Ishiro Honda could have told it. Here Godzilla is a tragic character, an animal who is trapped in a hostile world of technology that is not his own. Amazing and poignant. That is, unless Raymond Burr comes around."
1.0,gojira,"First-rate cinema, mainly due to Ishiro Honda's smart direction, Akira Ifukube's dread-filled score, and Eiji Tsubayara's special effects. Be sure to check the original Japanese cut and not the hacked up American version. The first Kaiju film is the most thoughtful and interesting."
1.0,gojira,This is the only version that should be viewed. The American version feels like a lobotomized abortion compared to the original Japanese cut.
1.0,gojira,One of the best monster movies.
1.0,gojira,"While I love the Raymond Burr version- and the many sequels- as camp fun, seeing this is like an epiphany. Who knew that a giant monster movie could be so profound, political and, yes, deep."
1.0,gojira,"Forget what you think you know about Godzilla movies, this is a beautiful anti-nuke film which really is king of the monsters. Timeless."
1.0,gojira,The original without Raymond Burr is an absolute masterpiece. What a way to symbolize the horror and destruction of the a-bomb after WWII. I highly recommend picking up the Special Anniversary Edition so that you can see both versions and (hopefully) agree with me. ^^
1.0,gojira,"The best Kaiju film ever, and I'm not jumping on the bandwagon when I say this. It truly is the greatest Kaiju eiga ever made. Don't believe me? Watch it and you'll see."
1.0,gojira,"I really recommend seeing the orgional film, it may defy expectations."
1.0,gojira,accept no imitations. the one and only gojira from the master of kaiju ishiro honda and toho studios
1.0,gojira,"I love the entire series to tell the truth, but the first installment is a nearly perfect bit of film and one of the best movies ever to come out of Japan."
1.0,gojira,The greatest Godzilla film of all time. And number 1 on my top ten list. Gojira is a classic monster film that gets way less credit than it deserves. A brilliant masterpiece in my eyes.
1.0,gojira,The embodiement of the feelings of horror and destruction of the atomic bomb in the form of a 30 story tall lizard.
1.0,gojira,If you can ignore the outdated special effects this is a great monster movie.
1.0,gojira,Japan has never escaped the shadow cast by the mushroom cloud. This is the embodiement of their terror. Not to be mistaken for the fluffier stuff that came later in the series.
1.0,gojira,"Best Godzilla movie ever, and a great allegory about nuclear weapons."
1.0,gojira,"This is a very good movie. Although it is a giant dinosaur, the Japanese know how to make a good monster movie. I can understand why this movie has a anti-nuke message, especially since the movie was released during the Cold War. I think this is a must see classic for everyone!"
1.0,gojira,"Godzilla is the greatest badass in monster history. Not even the Seventh Voyage of Sinbad dragon trumps the theme song and the radiation breath of this lizard. Sorry, Ray."
1.0,gojira,Amazing! I love this movie. YES!
1.0,gojira,one of the greats. all time classic must see monster film. next to king kong one of the most influential important films that few have seen. see the japanese version it truly is a masterpiece
1.0,gojira,the greatest monster film. original japanese version is the only version in my opinion. masterpiece
1.0,gojira,Original 1954 Japanese version of Godzilla without Raymond Burr present (but usa version is also included here). Ishiro Honda's film is a cinema classic.
1.0,gojira,"Somber, sad, haunting, and utterly essential. Really."
1.0,gojira,"The original ""Godzilla"" is still the best. An absolutely groundbreaking and revolutionary film, a monster movie with a message, it's somewhat cheapened by it's multitude of sequels."
1.0,gojira,"Far different from the Raymond Burr ""americanization"" an atomic allegory"
1.0,gojira,"The original Godzilla film was made as a horror film with symbolism to show the negative side to nuclear weapons, long before the campier and sillier films of the 60s and 70s."
1.0,gojira,One of the few horror movies that has a message that still has meaning.
1.0,gojira,Great film of iconic proportions
1.0,gojira,Finally we in the West can watch it without the American cut-ins and dub! Amazing film.
1.0,gojira,First and best. Ingore the man in suit and just watch the greatest film ever made in it full glory.
1.0,gojira,"The original, and still the best."
1.0,gojira,"Sort one of my favorite movies of all time. EVER. King Kong can bite my ass, at least Godzilla said something new, rather than ""it's beauty and the beast, but with GORILLAS and DINOSAURS""! I'll take socio-political commentary over flights of fantasy in at least THIS instance."
1.0,gojira,YEAH! Godzilla/Gojira rules either way! It's about time the original showed up on America's shores . . .
1.0,gojira,By far the greatest monster film ever created. This film does homage to the horror of the hydrogen bomb by artfully suggesting worldwide non-proliferation as the answer.
1.0,gojira,classic monster movie from Japan
1.0,gojira,Gojira (Godzilla) is far better than the American counterpart. I hope Toyo releases a restored version to DVD.
1.0,gojira,A true masterpiece on the horrors of war. Still relevent today. Don't be fooled by what you may have heard about Godzilla. Give this one a chance.
1.0,true-grit-2010,M-F-O8.5[Joel & Ethan Coen]
1.0,true-grit-2010,"Loyal to the book with great acting and a compelling screenplay, the most recent True Grit is a far cry from the John Wayne version. Grayer, grittier, and laced with dark humor. The brothers Coen achieve mightily."
1.0,true-grit-2010,i loved this remake starring his Dudeness
1.0,true-grit-2010,Beautiful story. One of the best movies I've ever wached.
1.0,true-grit-2010,"17/5/2017 - The perfect remake, I have to say even better than the 1969 original. Excellent acting by all, some funny moments and at under 2 hours long, doesn't overstay its welcome. True Grit is a pleasant surprise and i simply cannot fault it."
1.0,true-grit-2010,Great movie. Jeff Bridges was a joy to watch and lived up the the Duke!
1.0,true-grit-2010,True Grit is a balanced and poignant Western that blends interesting and quirky characters with a glaring revenge story and wonderfully refined violence.
1.0,true-grit-2010,A rowdy and rollicking yet grim Western that could only come (and succeed) from the Coen's bleak vision.
1.0,true-grit-2010,A must see one of a kind western with humor and action that keeps you entertained!
1.0,true-grit-2010,"Fun and terrific movie! So much great acting and camera view with emotional moments that not make you cry, but it can open your conscience."
1.0,true-grit-2010,This is the best western film I have ever seen!Would give it a 6 stars if I could!
1.0,true-grit-2010,"I'm not sure a perfect film exists but if it did, I imagine it would look something like this."
1.0,true-grit-2010,"Funny, real, strange, infectious."
1.0,true-grit-2010,great performance by all
0.0,true-grit-2010,If you think this is better than the original you are an idiot...
1.0,true-grit-2010,Great performances from the main cast and a great western remake from the Coen Brothers.
1.0,true-grit-2010,"The all too expected Coen gritty direction, mesmerizing linguistic wit and impeccable performances from its cast, otherwise familiar faces from previous Coen works, like Josh Brolin, Jeff Bridges or Matt Damon. A must see."
1.0,true-grit-2010,"If you have not been moved by this story, I would be extremely surprised. I certainly was."
1.0,true-grit-2010,Enjoyed the new rendition.
0.0,true-grit-2010,"very disappointed, all of them characters portrayed themselves with a certain mount of respect, cogburns was intermittent. but ultimately a good man , the portrayal of maddie as a weak and indecisive is upsetting despite her strong performance throughout the original."
1.0,true-grit-2010,"Such a great remake, with tremendous performances coming from newcomer Hailee Steinfeld and Jeff Bridges. And no I didn't forget about you Matt Damon"
1.0,true-grit-2010,"This is a grim, no-frills western epic. Every actor is superb. Every scene is perfectly presented. And every moment is engaging. 'True Grit' is but another sublime period piece that could only be brought to us by the Coen brothers."
1.0,true-grit-2010,Very good movie .. I am a big John Wayne fan and like the light hearted parts of the original.
1.0,true-grit-2010,I think this version is better than the original. Pilgrim. This is a movie that will tolerate multiple viewings. Bridges has more nuance than Wayne did. He's actually the more interesting Cogburn.
1.0,true-grit-2010,"Recaught this on FX this evening. Forgot what a great Coen Bros movie this was, and, enjoying this excellent performance by Hailee Steinfeld."
1.0,true-grit-2010,even better than the John Wayne version.
1.0,true-grit-2010,The Coen Brothers + A Western = PERFECTION.
1.0,true-grit-2010,They did a good job with the characters and the storyline is a great.Their acting is brilliant and when theirs a dramatic moment and when it's suppose to affective it manages to work because you're suppose to care about the characters.This movie was an excellent remake.
1.0,true-grit-2010,Good westerns are hard to come by these days. This one was fantastic!
1.0,true-grit-2010,spiced up with a great cast. A great remake of a old classic
1.0,true-grit-2010,True Grit is a masterful western epic fueled by strong acting and a captivating story. This is one of the best films of the year.
1.0,true-grit-2010,"Really well shot with great cast and acting didn't seem to find a flaw with this film was really impressed by this film and story, probably one of the best westerns I have seen."
1.0,true-grit-2010,one of the best movies I've ever seen
1.0,true-grit-2010,"Stylishly filmed, beautifully acted, dramatically engaging and thrilling in equal measure; this superb adaptation of Portis' book supersedes the original film in every aspect and leaves it positively wanting by comparison."
1.0,true-grit-2010,The Coen Brothers strike again with this amazing film based on the 1969 classic. All the performances were perfect and The Coen Brothers intense and detailed direction makes this one of my favorite Coen Brothers film (and that's saying something!).
0.0,true-grit-2010,I hate seeing the Coens stagger.
1.0,true-grit-2010,"Possibly my favorite film ever. Perfect tone, perfect performances, perfect everything. It was perfect."
1.0,true-grit-2010,"With apologies to fans of cult favorites like Lebowski, O Brother, etc. this is also in my top three Coen flicks. A refreshingly aptly done remake of a classic. The Coens are evident, but not overly so, just enough to add some modern zest and differentiate from the original."
1.0,true-grit-2010,I had a wonderful time at this Western and saw it three times on the big screen and enjoyed it more and more each time!!!! Like nothing you have ever seen before.
1.0,true-grit-2010,"Amazing. Such a good modern western movie. I have yet to see the original one, but this movie is full of just amazing things."
1.0,true-grit-2010,"I've seen the original 1969 True Grit with John Wayne, and as much as I love classic films. I'm going to have to say I love the 2010 version with Jeff Bridges better. Great film and is a modern yet classic masterpiece!"
1.0,true-grit-2010,Just flat out good. One of the best remakes ever next to Red Dawn.
1.0,true-grit-2010,"Even better than the original as this remake contains more ""grit."""
1.0,true-grit-2010,Just an amazing film all the way around!
1.0,true-grit-2010,"It's amazing how good Jeff Bridges was in this movie,and yet so horrible in Wild BIll."
1.0,true-grit-2010,very good story and a good western movie for the 21rst century
1.0,true-grit-2010,"It's taken me ages to watch this film, but it was worth the wait. Some first rate performances, especially from Haillie Steinfeld. Great stuff"
1.0,true-grit-2010,"such an excellent western film, some changes to the john wayne film though but it makes it feel fresher3 main leads are good"
1.0,true-grit-2010,"sorry John Wayne , but , this beats your classic."
1.0,true-grit-2010,"I didn't peg this to be my kind of film but I actually found it to be incredible. Amongst the violence and anger, there was heart and emotion. The three main character's were brilliantly and engagingly drawn, the script was great and the overall film bore the marks of a classic. Superb."
1.0,true-grit-2010,One of my all time favorites.

0.0,true-grit-2010,I downright hated this
1.0,true-grit-2010,"The Coen Brothers with a surprisingly sesibilidade out of the ordinary for them, making it better than the original."
1.0,true-grit-2010,Damon's character is the only issue I had with this film.
1.0,true-grit-2010,Watch this again for the second time (three years after the release) and enjoyed it immensely. The dialogue is wonderful once you tune your ear to the cadence. Wonderfully true to the original text with honoring nods to the original film. Truly a great quest film.
1.0,true-grit-2010,"Not only is this one of the best remakes of all time, it ranks with cinema's all time. This true masterpiece is unforgettable; delivering flawless performances and heartfelt scenes."
1.0,true-grit-2010,"Loved this one. I love the story told from the perspective of the 14 year old girl (an excellent Hailee Steinfeld). Fantastic all around, cast, direction, cinematography, all of it. Must see."

1.0,true-grit-2010,Another masterpiece from The Coen Brothers.
1.0,true-grit-2010,ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES IN THE HISTORY OF FILM
1.0,true-grit-2010,"I'm not a lover of westerns, but this is very good. Acting is great all round and laughs a plenty as you would expect from the coens. Have they ever made a bad movie? Go watch this NOW!!!!!!"
1.0,true-grit-2010,"Steinfeld gives a fantastic performance, from her rapid-fire dialogue to her headstrong demeanor. And for her first project, she does a remarkable job keeping up with Bridges and Damon, whose performances are just as brilliant."
1.0,true-grit-2010,Best movie I seen in a while!!!

1.0,true-grit-2010,"The Coen brothers are really, really good at taking an already written text and practically making it their own. The strengths lie in the cast and the storytelling, which keeps you on the edge of your seat. One of the best neo-Westerns without a doubt."
1.0,true-grit-2010,best western ive seen
1.0,true-grit-2010,"Have you guys seen this movie?! It's brilliant. Seen it for the third time, had to rate. I highly recommend. I'd say my favorite western. I was born to be a cowboy."
1.0,true-grit-2010,"A phenomenally designed homage to the western movie genre that has all but withered out over the decades. It is admirably acted and emotionally gripping with a hard, as the title suggests, gritty attitude in the center that makes this film an instant modern day western classic."
0.0,true-grit-2010,"The original was amazing. Even though Jeff Bridges and Matt Damon were in this, 2 of my favorite actors, I might add, this remake was just awful....I mean really awful."

1.0,true-grit-2010,"Best Western ever made. Realistic effects, lots of gunslinging, perfect performances from the cast, avenging plot, perfect casting, perfect cinematography, some humor, and lots of heart. A perfect remake of the original, and one that will live on for years."
1.0,true-grit-2010,True grit just went from great scene to great scene. It has got great performances especially from Hailee Steifield. Directed Beautifully by the Coen Brothers. 5\5 Excellent.
1.0,true-grit-2010,I think this could be one of the best films of Coen brothers.I like this film better than John Wayen's original film in 1969.
1.0,true-grit-2010,"I love this movie to death. Jeff Bridges is fantastic, but Hailee Steinfeld steals the show completely."
1.0,true-grit-2010,Excellent performances by the cast and one of the best westerns in the recent years.

1.0,true-grit-2010,"Who would've thought that the Coen's best movie, would be a remake? With a fantastic cast (including Hailee Steinfeld as the wise-cracking little fire cracker Mattie Ross), True Grit is a rare remake, that only the Coen brothers could make."
0.0,true-grit-2010,Try as you may Coen's you can't beat the original classic with John Wayne.
1.0,true-grit-2010,"""The tense verbal comedy of Mattie's early negotiation with a Fort Smith merchant should win you over to this movie's high linguistic wit."""

0.0,true-grit-2010,"The acting of Jeff Bridges and Matt Damon was unbelievable, it was almost more like a caricature of their parts. Besides it was some kind of boring. No comparison to the original. Had expected a lot more from the Coen Brothers.Just one star for Hailee Steinfeld."
1.0,true-grit-2010,"Gritty as the title promises, but a double meaning for the grit of the personage involved. An excellent film all around: acting, cinematography and story. I would see it again and fully expect the Academy to look more than once at the actors here."

1.0,mad_max_fury_road,"I didn't really care about this film when I went to the theatre, I've never been a big fan of post apocalyptic themes, but my feelings totally changed when I saw this beauty from George Miller. Hardy is great as Max, but Charlize Theron's Furiosa steals the show!"

0.0,mad_max_fury_road,"Here's the synopsis. Race across the desert being chased by bad guys only to find out where you were going isn't there, so go back from whence you came, kill all the rest of the bad guys, world peace restored. Two hours of my life I won't get back. This won Oscars for technical merit? I guess. #yawn"

0.0,mad_max_fury_road,What plot? Men ruin the world and Max is a blundering moron who ouldn't hold his own dick while pissing - enter balded Theron to get him through those hard parts. Haven't walked out of a film since matrix reloaded...
1.0,mad_max_fury_road,"Destined to be a modern classic, Mad Max: Fury Road provides mind blowing and refreshingly sensational action sequences, but also has a strong narrative injecting some humanity into the film."

0.0,mad_max_fury_road,This is the most overrated film I have ever seen. Sure the visuals are amazing but that doesn't make up for an overall crappy movie.
1.0,mad_max_fury_road,"I'm not a fan of the Mad Max franchise, but ""Fury Road"" was excellent! ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" has a decent story (albeit with plot holes aplenty) and interesting characters with marvelous costume, makeup and special effects. It's truly spectacular."

0.0,mad_max_fury_road,The special effects and sound were great. THE ACTUAL MOVIE was awful.
0.0,mad_max_fury_road,"Horribly overrated. Nothing more than two hour, pointless, chase scene. It might resonate with fans of the original, which to be frank, I didn't care for either. It was better than the 'Farce' Awakens."
0.0,mad_max_fury_road,"I thought this was one of the worst films I've seen for a very very long time. No real plot or story, just a feature length action sequence without end, which ultimately just becomes boring."
1.0,mad_max_fury_road,"Balls to the wall, no comprise. This film - in an epic way - tells a primal story without force-feeding you the plot or the message."
1.0,twilight_samurai,"This film along with The Hidden Blade (same director) are two of the best samurai movies out there. When I say samurai movie, I mean one that is not only historically accurate, but the story is deep and moving. If you rather watch action rubbish, then go google some ninja vs samurai crap."
1.0,twilight_samurai,"A beautiful display of the Edo period, and a fine job from Hiroyuki Sanada."
1.0,twilight_samurai,One of the best new millennium films I've ever seen.
1.0,twilight_samurai,"Beautiful, moving, poetic, multi-themed and densely layered; Most cinematic samurai film I have ever seen; Easily walking the lane of Kurosawa's rAn"
1.0,twilight_samurai,this is just a beautiful film.
1.0,twilight_samurai,Incredible little film. Don't see it for the action though. Subtitled.
0.0,twilight_samurai,"Couldn't even make it through the first hour. ""The director Yoji Yamada's devotion to somber, everyday detail will test the patience of many viewers of this slow-going character drama."""
1.0,twilight_samurai,"IMHO, this is much better than Love and Honour!! Definitely one of the best samurai film. It gets you every time. It warms you and it lingers in your mind for days after watching it."
1.0,twilight_samurai,"Fantabulosa, estupendástica. Totalmente recomendable, sobretodo si te gusta el género. :)"
1.0,twilight_samurai,"A sweet, gripping drama that shines light on a unique portion of the Samurai culture. As a Westerner, mostly exposed to the Samurai as killing machines, this film is very refreshing. Easily one of the best films I have ever seen."
1.0,twilight_samurai,Classic samurai drama.
1.0,twilight_samurai,Absolutely stunning movie.
1.0,twilight_samurai,Brilliant. Just brilliant.
1.0,twilight_samurai,"A story of a man who gives up everything he has for his daughters. The hero, Seibei, is a man worthy of looking up to even though everyone sees him as an outcast."

1.0,twilight_samurai,Definitely 5 star movie.
1.0,twilight_samurai,One of my two favorite samurai movies
1.0,twilight_samurai,Yamada + Relationships= I love it.
1.0,twilight_samurai,"A very moving piece showing a time where samurai are more like public employees than warriors. Seibei, the main character, embodies very well a samurai who knew what was coming and embraced peace. Along with ""Harakiri"", a very recommended unusual samurai movie."
1.0,twilight_samurai,"It's wonderful. As nearly perfect a movie as I've seen in awhile. It moves slowly, but that didn't bother me. It just made the conclusion more powerful."
1.0,twilight_samurai,"Focusing a movie on the emotional development of a Samurai may seem like a curveball, but the Twilight Samurai had a lot of great moments. Seibei is a poet at heart, and is witnessing the end of an era. The action is sparse but poignant, and the climax is truly plausible."
1.0,twilight_samurai,A masterpiece about a reluctant warrior
1.0,twilight_samurai,"A beautiful, gently paced examination of Japanese culture at it draws to the close of an era. Yamada brings something unbelievably fresh to the Samurai genre with this quiet, powerful little exploration of a family in crisis."
1.0,twilight_samurai,An extremely moving and sincere film. The best movie I've watched this year (even though it was released in 2002).
1.0,twilight_samurai,"Bit by bit, to guide you into the real world of past Japanese samurai. Quiet, classical and low key movie, I really enjoy the atmosphere of this brilliant film."
1.0,twilight_samurai,Hands down one if the best Samurai movies ever.
1.0,twilight_samurai,"At the twilight of Samurai era, the everyday odissey of man true to the values of a class who lost its purpose. With the deepness of scope and a mood reminiscent of ""The man who shot Liberty Vallance"". Chambara goes intimistic, with an inspired Sanada in the lead."
1.0,twilight_samurai,I can't believe how good this movie is.
1.0,twilight_samurai,One of the best movies I have ever seen.
1.0,twilight_samurai,"Heartfelt inside-out view of a petty samurai's life. Really, really enjoyed it!"
1.0,twilight_samurai,"Hiroyuki Sanada does such a perfect job in the role of a lower class, widower, samurai. This movie isnt ""packed"" with action, but instead weaves a bittersweet story intermixed with a few intense duels."
1.0,twilight_samurai,"Undoubtedly the best samurai movie ever made. Hands down. Period. End of discussion. Yes, I have seen The Seven Samurai."
1.0,twilight_samurai,twilight samurai is a beautiful movie. It gives a very real atmosphere to the story. I like the fight scenes in the movie. they seem more real than over the top.

1.0,twilight_samurai,BY FAR ONE OF MY FAVOURITE MOVIES OF ALL TIME!!!  Its good to see a movie where the hero isn't striving to be the biggest badass on the planet!  Fight scenes ARE FANTASTIC!!! It has a very realistic feel!!!
1.0,twilight_samurai,"Not your ordinary sword-slashing samurai film. Instead, it is a thoughtful drama dealing w/, among other things, the end of an era + the nature of duty - to one's family, to one's clan, to others. Excellent film."
1.0,twilight_samurai,The most realistic samurai movie ever!
1.0,twilight_samurai,"this was possibly the most beautiful movie i have ever seen. it was quietly touching and completely moving. every time i see it, it gets deeper under my skin and stays with me for weeks."

1.0,twilight_samurai,"Watched this a long time, and it deserves a fair review because it is absolutely a delight from beginning to end. Great film-making, with awesome story and the great performance of Hiroyuki Sanada. Never thought I would find a Japanese actor who always looked so amazingly handsome!"
1.0,twilight_samurai,"Un film de samurai parfait, ou les combats passent au second plan. Les japonais sont capables du meilleur comme du pire, du plus vulgaire comme du plus fin, la on est plutot gate."
1.0,twilight_samurai,Good enough to put on the shelf next to any Kurosawa film.........and that is all that needs to be said.
1.0,twilight_samurai,Another excelent Samurai film.

1.0,twilight_samurai,Incredible and beautiful.
1.0,twilight_samurai,"This movie stands alone as one of the great movies of its genre because the main character thinks more about his family than his own reputation. Great film, actors and story line."
1.0,twilight_samurai,"Beautiful movie. This is a rare man...who puts everything in life that is made so important aside...and does the best he can for those he loves. The acting is so good..the story is rich, the scenery is beautiful. You get done watching this and feel so good."
1.0,twilight_samurai,Very good. Captured Japanese culture well.
1.0,twilight_samurai,"Excellent, understated, emotive. I loved the fight scenes - stripped down to the essentials. But it's the acting and character-driven plot that drives this film. Really very special."
1.0,twilight_samurai,"What Last Samurai wishes it had been. Simply a great film. Any words I'd use to describe it would not do it justice. If you have an appreciation for samurai culture that extends beyond the bloodletting, you owe it to yourself to see this film."
1.0,twilight_samurai,A beautiful Meiji period drama about the responsibilities and obligations of a low-ranked samurai during a period of immense societal upheaval. This is not for you if you are expecting flashy swordplay and gushing blood. Seems quite historically accurate.

1.0,twilight_samurai,"Very simple, subtle film. A very special film to me."
0.0,twilight_samurai,Slow and boring. The dvd transfer is rubbish quality too -looks like VHS.
1.0,twilight_samurai,This film provided a unique insight into a lower class samurai's life. Something we rarely get to see in most samurai movies. The story line was excellent and the acting as gripping.
1.0,twilight_samurai,"Best samurai movie I've seen. Beyond that it excels as a movie itself. It brings a very human essence on screen, and is a breath of fresh air."

1.0,twilight_samurai,Very impressive storytelling. It sucks me into the story and to make a connection with the characters.
1.0,twilight_samurai,I love the subtleness of the character. Not your typical samurai and amazing fight at the end. Very believable. And a tragic tenderness between Seibei and the woman he loves.
1.0,twilight_samurai,"This is Japan's answer to Tom ""stare off into the distance"" Cruise' The last Samurai, marking the end of the samurai era. Characters are so well made and connectable with. Sad ending but a journey from start to end."
1.0,twilight_samurai,"This is an amazing story! It doesn't focas on the fighting and action so much, buit rather it focases on the Charactors, and their relationships with oneanother. It tends to draw ou the Emotion, rather than the Sword."
1.0,twilight_samurai,"This movie shows another aspect on the life of the samurai. There isnt about swordfights but shows the person, his emotions and struggle during the end of the samurai era."
1.0,twilight_samurai,"A beautiful film about the end of the feudal period in Japan, when concepts of honor began to change. It's seen from the point of view of a low-ranking samurai who must choose between duty and what he cherishes most dearly."

1.0,twilight_samurai,Beautiful dramatic film set in fuedal Japan about the conflict between a man's duties to his community and his two young children and the woman that he loves. So much better than the usual dumbed down nonsense you get with films dealing with Samurai.

1.0,twilight_samurai,"There is no resisting liking this wonderful portrayal of a low-ranking samurai in the tumultous end of the Tokugawa era, his family and his life. His philosophy and way of the sword is admirable. Also, enjoy fully the scenery - it's almost as beautiful in reality!"
1.0,twilight_samurai,"A modern masterpiece, it could have been done by Kurosawa"

1.0,twilight_samurai,"A lovely, sweet, suspenseful and atypical samurai film."
1.0,twilight_samurai,Another of my House Favorites. Hiroyuki Sanada is marvelous as a humble widower whose overlord calls upon him to kill a man. Well worth the leisurely pace at which the narrative unwinds.

1.0,twilight_samurai,5 Stars... Excellent movie. Very emotional. I love the main charecters humility. Beautiful script. I must say this just may be in my top 10.
1.0,twilight_samurai,Wow. Perhaps one of the most true and realistic depictions of what Bushido really means. This movie made me cry and re-think my position and perception on the concept of Bushido. Sanada Hiroyuki is an amazing actor.

1.0,searchers,A John Wayne movie which develops character and is not your typical shoot-em up westernreally enjoyed

1.0,searchers,"""YOU SPEAK GOOD COMANCHE. SOMEONE TEACH YOU?"""
1.0,searchers,"The Searchers was definitely a treat to sit through. From its great musical score, amazing action scenes, terrific script, and fantastic performances (particularly from John Wayne), it is regarded as one of cinema's finest westerns for a damn good reason!Overall Grade: A+ (10/10)"
1.0,searchers,"Has to be near top of the list in all genre of movies, of Westerns it is at the top. A near Perfect Movie. Wayne is brutal, maniacal and all too Human as Ethan Edwards. Rest of Cast in also Top Notch."
1.0,searchers,"A must see. A masterpiece. Perhaps, just the best movie in History.View several times, last time in the Filmoteca española (The Spanish Film Library, Madrid)"
1.0,searchers,May be the best western film ever made. Unapologeticly shows the struggle of life on the frontier and the thin line between revenge and redemption.
1.0,searchers,"Westerns have a history of simplification and, for a long time, needed a more thorough tackling of the genre. That is why John Ford's darker undertaking starring the Duke, himself, is both a relief and the greatest revisioning of the heart of Westerns."
1.0,searchers,Best Western ever alongside Unforgiven.

1.0,searchers,One of the grandest films ever made.
1.0,searchers,The Searchers has beautiful photography with such elaborate details on composition and framing. The story intensifies as we are also given some good humour and lighter tones. The sweeping scope of the valleys and deserts are attractive and there's a great handle on its art production.
1.0,searchers,"my dad dropped my sister and i at the movie to see this, i was 11 and she 9. we loved it so much that we stayed and watched it twice. over the years i have watched it numerous times, great movie"

1.0,searchers,It made it's place in my top 5 westerns list.
1.0,searchers,"Without a doubt one of the greatest movies of all time and certainly up there as one of the best westerns of all time, if not the best western of all time. A forgotten, under-appreciated movie that just happens to be a masterpiece."
1.0,searchers,One of those great films that even those that love it are a bit ambivalent about and I think that is a very good thing. Great art should make you a bit uncomfortable.
1.0,searchers,Greatest Western of all time!!!!!
1.0,searchers,"The quintessential Western - John Wayne gives an iconic performance. I can't figure out if the movie was racist or simply depicts racism, but either way it's incredibly powerful"
1.0,searchers,"One of the best westerns ever made, unforgettable film."
1.0,searchers,The weight of a 3 religious epic jam packed into a less than 2 hour cowboy epic chronicling mainly the exploits of 2 men in a game of cat and mouse with the band of Comanche that slaughtered their family in the postbellum West.
1.0,searchers,I don't think Western genre can get any better than this.
1.0,searchers,"This one breaks the tomatometer. If you can, get a copy with Director Peter Bogdanovich's commentary. It opened my eyes to the Master's skill."
0.0,searchers,"This movie tries to create complex characters but fails with inconstancy, bad acting, and cliches. Its ""grand"" vistavision cinematography is great at first but goes nowhere. Nothing in this movie develops well. This is probably the most overrated western if not movie of all time."
1.0,searchers,THIS IS ONE HIS GREATEST MOVIES
1.0,searchers,The greatest western visually and an unbelievable story. There are people who say that john wayne wasn't a great actor but this is one that shows off his diffrent styles and personalities. this film is why john ford was why he is one of the greastest film directors of all time.

1.0,searchers,One of John Wayne's best westerns. What a loss Jefferey Hunter was.

1.0,searchers,"Vengeance in its obsessive, destructive form, that's what John Ford's masterpiece is all about, and what Ford's mis-en-scene expresses so eloquently, inimitably. With perhaps one of the greatest final shots in all of cinema."

1.0,paths_of_glory,An exceptional film portraying the futility of the battles of War War I and the corruption that occurs when polotics get involved in War.
1.0,paths_of_glory,"This is another one of those war movies that isn't about the special effects as it is about the characters and the war experience. It is quite a powerful film and it will not bore you, unless you're really picky about your movies."

1.0,paths_of_glory,Great early Kubrick about the futility of war.
1.0,paths_of_glory,Perhaps one of the first (and best) films to deliberately approach the war epic genre from a moral perspective. The dichotomy of the French army during WWI is exposed by Kirk Douglas's powerful performance.

1.0,paths_of_glory,"One of the greatest anti-war films ever made, Stanley Kubrick presents us a harsh, grim, emotional and an outstandingly engaging piece of the failures of blind patriotism, loyalty, corruption and war itself.

1.0,paths_of_glory,favorite line (paraphrase): look at that cockroach. tomorrow he'll be alive and i won't....favorite scene: (a no brainer) colonel daxs' apology....perfectly blends humour (quite often in a subtle manner) and fine drama.......highly recommended.....
1.0,paths_of_glory,"A beautifully shot film about the horrid bureaucratic ""principles"" that have come to define modern day war."
1.0,paths_of_glory,"Almost satirical in it's exaggerated depiction of military corruption, Stanley Kubrick's WWI Drama is an unforgettable descent into the evils of War and it's uncanny ability to strip away the compassion and nobility of the men that wage it."

1.0,paths_of_glory,"There are very few movies worthy of an 100% rating, let alone movies with a 100% rating that I would not want to watch more than once. The POV shots, the obvious injustice, and the hauntingly beautiful ending puts this movie with top three war films ever made."

1.0,paths_of_glory,"Allez, hoe meer ge terug graaft in het oeuvre van Kubrick, hoe beter zijn films worden!"
1.0,paths_of_glory,"It's good to know that some things never change. After re-watching Paths of Glory for perhaps the 4th or 5th time (and the first time in several years), it still remains, unquestionably, the best film about war of all time."
1.0,paths_of_glory,"Hands-down the best WWI movie I've seen, and one of the best war movies out there. Kubrick is brilliant with his methods that use wit, frustration, and terror interchangeably, without ever succumbing to traditional techniques and cliches. Douglas is magnificent."
1.0,paths_of_glory,a rare masterpiece ...one of the best movies i ever saw. Its Kubrick's best in my opinion.
1.0,paths_of_glory,What a movie! What an amazingly wonderful movie about the evils of war. The ending too is one of the powerful i've ever seen. Thank you Stanley Kubrick: Master Film maker!!!

1.0,paths_of_glory,"Uncompromising antiwar reel, Kubrick matter-of-fact, class-conscious with all the exits blocked. Personal favourite: Douglas buttonholing General Staff Menjou at the dinner party. Menjou, ""There are few things more fundamentally encouraging & stimulating than seeing someone else die."""
1.0,paths_of_glory,"This movie delivers on all fronts. Worth it just for Kirk Douglas' sublime suggestion to his oily French General, ""Would you like me to tell you what you can do with that promotion, sir?"""
1.0,paths_of_glory,Stanley Kubricks anti-war masterpiece.
1.0,paths_of_glory,"This is one of the best anti-war films ever made. There's no fault with this movie, it packs a wallop so tightly in its 87 minute run time. Kirk Douglas is excellent in this. Stanley Kubrick really is one of the best filmmakers of all time, and this is one of his best and most overlooked."
1.0,paths_of_glory,Simpy the best anti-war film ever made.
1.0,paths_of_glory,"My personal pick for the most powerful anti-war film ever made. I would also rate it as Stanley Kubrick's finest achievement, largely because it has an emotional core and heartbreaking empathy for its doomed characters that many of his other masterpieces lack."
1.0,paths_of_glory,One of the best war movies ever.
1.0,paths_of_glory,My favorite Stanley Kubrick film (followed closely by Doctor Strangelove) but also one of my favorite ANTI WAR movies. I do not think any movie has captured the absurdity and insanity of Warfare better than this 1957 movie that still is still relevant today.
1.0,paths_of_glory,This film plus A Very Long Engagement pretty much sum up WW1 from the French perspective. It is hard to believe that this film is over 50 years old because it has held up so well. Just a great film.
1.0,paths_of_glory,"The best WWI movie ever made! Shows the senseless decisions in WWI that costs many lives. Kirk Douglas' best film, besides Spartacus."

1.0,paths_of_glory,"Stanley Kubrick's shattering indictment of the military mindset rings true from its calm opening all the way to its gut-wrenching finale. Kubrick was never as succinct and relentless in any of his subsequent pictures. Superb writing, directing, acting, and camerawork. An absolute masterpiece."
1.0,paths_of_glory,ONE OF KUBRICK'S GREAT WORKS OF ART AND ONE OF THE TOP 5 BEST WAR FILM
1.0,paths_of_glory,One of the great war movies. The scenes of Douglas walking through the trenches are brilliant.

1.0,paths_of_glory,"Kubrick's word about the war, or should I say, the absurdity of war. you can only agree with the main description - powerful, timeless and universal. it's so strong that you start to hate the army and all those fat, hypocritical generals instantly. Kubrick was a genius."
1.0,paths_of_glory,Brilliant drama piercing the depths of the soul as tormented by the horrors of war.

1.0,paths_of_glory,Paths of Glory is a tremendous film and one of Kubrick's most underrated. Kirk Douglas performance is transcendent and the action in the film is as good as it gets.
1.0,paths_of_glory,"Kubrick does it again(though technically this would be counted as his first major movie,i watched this one in the end ).The mother of all war movies."
1.0,paths_of_glory,Intense Kubrick war masterpiece about incompetent French generals who cause the death of their own soldiers in order to vainly pursue their own ambitions. They cover-up their own crimes by executing their own men. Banned for a long time in France and based on fact. Kirk Douglas is sensational here.

1.0,paths_of_glory,Short but very sweet (though the story is less than sweet). As expected with Stanley Kubrick this is great. It shows the measure of an artists if he/she can produce great works even in miniature form. Great acting all around in this film and a thought provoking story.

1.0,spiderman_2,Raimi focuses more on action rather than origin in this solid sequel.
1.0,spiderman_2,"One of the best sequels ever made. Spider Man 2 is even better the awesome first movie. The romance is genuine, the villain is a real threat and the action is great. Spider Man 2 focuses a little more on Peter's powers failing and him trying to improve. It's a great follow up to a great movie."
1.0,spiderman_2,"The sequel focuses more on Peter Parker than it does on Spider-Man. As such, there is a surprisingly good blend of pathos and great action sequences. A good deal of praise definitely goes to Alfred Molina, the puppeteers and CGI experts who make Doc Ock one cool tragic villain."
1.0,spiderman_2,"One of the best films I have ever seen. It lived up to the hype it was producing and proved to be the best summer film. No action film, especially not a spiderman one, will ever be better than this one. It stays consistent, builds momentum, and has its dramatic and tensing moments."

1.0,goldfinger,best james bond ever
1.0,goldfinger,"Hard to imagine this movie is almost 50 years old. Has stood the test of time well. Still exciting, still relevant. Sean Connery is at his peak, as is this Bond film which falls second (possibly) only to Casino Royale."
1.0,goldfinger,"The grand-daddy of all Bond films past and present, ""Goldfinger"" is very memorable, and hinted at the direction that the series would follow."

1.0,goldfinger,Best Bond movie ever.
1.0,goldfinger,"What can't you say about this movie? It has everything, and is wonderfully cheesy and camp. This is Bond when Bond was allowed to be Bond, before he had to go on some kind of existentialist quest to save the world, and instead, could fight evil gold-obsessed bad guys."
1.0,goldfinger,The most iconic film of the Connery era and beyond.
1.0,goldfinger,Classic Bond at its best. Bond's classic witticisms really begin here. Memorable villains and Bond girls. The Aston Martin DB5 is introduced with its many gadgets in use here.

0.0,1005973-diva,"Sheer crapfest! Definitely high in the top ten of the worst movies, I've ever seen. Soooo boring, and - worst of all - stylistically self-indulgent in a very annoying way. Avoid!"
1.0,1005973-diva,"Mystery, punk music, opera (the amazing Willemina), streets of Paris, the Zen of a loaf of broad.... c'est fantastique! I still LOVE and PLAY the soundtrack at least a few times a year!"

1.0,1005973-diva,80's french new wave....love it!

1.0,1005973-diva,SO glad this is now out on DVD. I keenly remember seeing it my freshman year of college and just being blown away. An essential New Wave '80s movie.
1.0,1005973-diva,you either get it or youre a caveman/woman
1.0,1005973-diva,"cult..watched it 6 times,great photography..."

1.0,1005973-diva,This movie is one of the most beautiful movies I have seen in a while. It stays with you long after the final image has faded from the screen.
1.0,1005973-diva,This film is the shit
1.0,1005973-diva,My very first foreign film and it was fantastic. And I've been hooked on foreign films ever since.
1.0,1005973-diva,"Visually, the top movie of all time."
1.0,1005973-diva,un des films cultes des années 80'
1.0,1005973-diva,The coolest movie ever.
1.0,1005973-diva,"Yeah, it's embarrassing that it's been one of my favorites since I was 14. Then again, it's freaking fantastic. Noir galore. Enjoy it. Will make you want love, and to see an opera."
1.0,1005973-diva,another great movie by Luc Bresson
0.0,1005973-diva,This film's glamorization of pedophilia and celebrity stalking seems more and more offensive with each passing year.
1.0,1005973-diva,"i have to say it, it's very french. beautiful scenes and color (i love all of the lighting, and jules' warehouse space is very cool), wilhelmenia fernandez's incredible voice, and great attention to detail add to the twisted plot."
1.0,1005973-diva,Gorgeous and gripping. 'nuff said.
1.0,1005973-diva,Great movie! Love the lofts.
1.0,1005973-diva,got to the film forum asap! cool and funny
1.0,1005973-diva,"Perhaps the most picturesque film to come out of France in years, unified by the extraordinary decor - colour supplement chic meets pop art surrealism - which creates a world of totally fantastic reality situated four-square in contemporary Paris."
1.0,1005973-diva,"So... French. Beautiful, scary, fluffy."
1.0,1005973-diva,best movie i have seen up to date
1.0,1005973-diva,"My fave of all time - and I'm not sure why. All I know is that I can watch this movie again and again, and never get tired of it."

1.0,1005973-diva,great film for it's time and still as good today.
1.0,1005973-diva,"Rolig, spÃ¤nnande, vacker och underlig... ja, den hÃ¤r filmen har det mesta."
1.0,1005973-diva,"One of the first films that took me out of my seat and into the screen..ambient, beautiful, emotive, disconnected and stylish"
1.0,1005973-diva,"A fun, cool French movie with a postman, gangsters, and an opera diva."
1.0,1005973-diva,An action film directed with space in it. One of the most memorable scenes is buttering a baguette. You won't see that in a Steven Seagal movie.
1.0,1005973-diva,The story is as relevant today as then; and the cinematography is amazing.
1.0,1005973-diva,"A crazy French thriller, a prime example of la cinema du look. Classic Vespa chase. ONLY a French action movie would have a Vespa chase."
1.0,1005973-diva,"I love this movie more than any other. Watch it whenever I'm feeling bad about life. Unbelievably beautiful, fun and smart."
1.0,1005973-diva,"A brilliant French thriller cleverly deals with copyright issues, as the performance of an opera diva is taped without approval. Suddenly everybody's after the bootleg tape. Watch out, Jules!"
1.0,1005973-diva,"just cool, and super music"
1.0,1005973-diva,Would love to see it again. I just remember it being visually magnificent and VERY funny.
1.0,1005973-diva,when I saw it the first time it was the coolest and best film ever. Having seen it acouple if times more recently it becomes clear how much before its time it was
1.0,1005973-diva,"Fabulous, loads of plot twists, cool Zen man and the best car in the world!"
1.0,1005973-diva,this is about respect & love of music
1.0,1005973-diva,Ice-cool and absorbing mystery wrapped around 2 tapes and as many love stories...
1.0,1005973-diva,"One of my all-time faves for its great music and ""french-ness"". A classic."
1.0,1005973-diva,The coolest film for a style conscious cat
1.0,1005973-diva,"Still awesome after all these years - the music, the plot and the gorgeous cinematography make this a real treat."
1.0,1005973-diva,"COOL Just COOL -- This is the best of the free-wheeling optimistic, liberal, open-minded 80's France. The last good big-bucks French movie ever made (sighs...)"
1.0,1005973-diva,25 years later it is still fantastic to see again.
1.0,1005973-diva,"Visually stunning, hyperkinetic thriller has it all. It's a shame that Wilhelmina Wiggins-Fernandez (the diva herself) cannot act -- but she has such a transcendent voice that it hardly matters. Every other aspect is perfect."
1.0,1005973-diva,Lovely film with odd characters + a very nice sound track.
1.0,1005973-diva,BRILLIANT movie - one of my all time greats
1.0,1005973-diva,Beineix! Not your typical French film. A bit of brooding but mostly great fun...
1.0,1005973-diva,"Beautiful, intelligent, surprising, funny, subtle - just make sure you are watching the original or a well synchronized version. Sub-titles spoil it all."
1.0,1005973-diva,"A 1980s movie that is pure art. Amazing soundtrack, beautiful scenery, quirky characters, artfully shot. What it lacks in substance (and in the acting talents of operatic talent Ms. Fernandez), it more than makes up for in style and thrills. One of my all-time favorites."
1.0,1005973-diva,Den kjølige elegansen kombinert med vakker opera og filming slo meg i bakken
1.0,1005973-diva,"This film is saturated with Wilhelmenia Wiggins Fernandez's divine operatic vocals. The cast of French oddities have never been bettered, with a roller skating teenage thief, a postal worker who loves opera but steals the diva's dress and a hippy recluse who is trying to make the perfect baguette."
1.0,1005973-diva,A stylish visual and musical feast.
1.0,1005973-diva,"the film that got me into scooters, opera, and baghettes with caviar.. have never looked back"
1.0,1005973-diva,They don't come any better than this
1.0,1005973-diva,Watch as a double bill with Subway. This is a teenage 'i'm so alternative' staple. Helped make me feel special...
1.0,1005973-diva,Un autre de mes films fetiches
1.0,1005973-diva,It built up its reputation in over a year of cinema release before it became a massive hit. That just would not be possible now.
1.0,1005973-diva,This movie is so beautifully made and the story is so engaging and DIFFERENT even though the theme is universal. I also love the soundtrack.
1.0,1005973-diva,je n'aime pas Beethoven
1.0,1005973-diva,This was one of my favourite films. I have watched it a ridiculous number of times. Had the soundtrack as well. Saw Wilhelmena Fernandez live in concert. She was as good in person as in the film. Read the book and others that this was based on.
1.0,1005973-diva,Serioulsy cool film. The theme song is out of this world.
1.0,1005973-diva,Beineix's first film - simply stunning - could watch it again and again. PS the trick of wearing a mask and snorkel to chop onions does not work!
1.0,1005973-diva,"A wonderful, stylish ride"
1.0,1005973-diva,classic 80s French film
1.0,1005973-diva,25 years and still my favorite movie of all time.....paris.....sigh
1.0,1005973-diva,This was a very compelling thriller and I loved every minute of it. I loved the subplots and the intrincate makeup of the whole story. The motorcycle chase and the opera singing was extraordinary. I am not a fan of opera but she made you want to listen to opera! What a voice!
1.0,1005973-diva,My favourite Paris film ever - Paris in the 80s without being cleaned up by Jeunet. Music by way of Opera and cigarettes by way of Gitanes. Beautiful
1.0,1005973-diva,"One of the most beautiful pieces of celluloid ever! Grace Bumbry the femme fatale who is the object of desire for a crazed fan, who decides to take matters into his own hands."
1.0,1005973-diva,"Existentialist thriller, what's not to like?"
1.0,1005973-diva,I love the music... the movie is sick

1.0,1005973-diva,"One of my top 10 movies. It is beautiful, quirky, flawed, and ultimately, brilliant."
1.0,1005973-diva,"Murder, conspiracy, opera, mopeds ... and everyone lives in really cool apartments. If I ever manage to visit France in my lifetime, it's going to be such a letdown."
1.0,1005973-diva,One of my all time favorites! Brilliant! Multi-level agenda. Intelligent!
1.0,1005973-diva,"Although it will likely not age well, this is one of my favourites. A new-wave tale of mistaken identity."
1.0,1005973-diva,"Darling French boys, girls on rollerskates, and, yes, the Zen Master... truly one of the best movies ever made."
1.0,1005973-diva,Love French New Wave!
1.0,1005973-diva,"One of the most creative story lines ever, and as abstract as France can get."
1.0,1005973-diva,"If you like weird European movies with great music, you'll love this one."
1.0,1005973-diva,I saw this originally in french class in high school. I thought it was the coolest movie I've ever seen. It was.
1.0,1005973-diva,The protagonist Jules is who I wanted to be in high school. La Wally is the most beautiful piece of music still.
1.0,1005973-diva,Classic. Period. Wilhemenia Higgins Hernandez rocks.
1.0,1005973-diva,"10/10Riveting thriller with style to spare and layers like a . . . multi-layerd cake . . . yeah, cake . . . mmmmm."

1.0,1011615-king_kong,"Hard to say something about one of the 'classics'...still, my two cents would mention that, rather than being a ""monster movie"", or placed in the horror genre, this is quite simply an excellent adventure film, with effects that were years ahead of anything being done at the time..."
1.0,1011615-king_kong,"Hooray! A giant ape, a screaming lady, people who use the word ""Say"" at the start of sentences and some surprisingly good stop-motion animation too. This is a classic classic."

1.0,1011615-king_kong,"Can't go wrong with kong, especially the original."
1.0,1011615-king_kong,"The greatest monster movie of all-time, hands down. Like the many great monster-horror movies of the 1930's, it has just as much heart as it has scares."

1.0,empire_strikes_back,"Another classic. What stands out the most for me is the sound design. Two examples are the search party droids at the beginning, with the code they repeat, and the sound of the machine that freezes Han, as it's warming up. This is high drama the whole way through."

1.0,empire_strikes_back,"Defined the blockbuster sequel and the standard for all movie sequels to follow, Empire's darker, emotional and larger scope paved the way to not only one of the great films ever made but also the greatest sequel ever made to a masterpiece of a trilogy"
1.0,empire_strikes_back,The best of the trilogy with greater character depth and realism you don't really find in sci-fi movies. Setting the bar high for a fantastic set of movies unfortunately ruined by Return Of Jedi...
1.0,empire_strikes_back,"Intense, mature and darker. Offers the best in the franchise."

1.0,empire_strikes_back,Still my favorite movie of all time.
1.0,empire_strikes_back,"The force is running in the family, but previous to that revelation this is the best of the entire saga due to a number of unpredictable twists. Sadly, modern kids, being already acquainted with Yoda, will never be able to understand how it felt to discover him for the first time in 1980."
1.0,empire_strikes_back,"A terrific sequel with slightly less action, but greatly enhanced plot and story follows. Awesome!"

1.0,empire_strikes_back,Definitely the best Star Wars film yet
1.0,empire_strikes_back,Err Star Wars need I say more
0.0,empire_strikes_back,This movie is bad because no military strategist would ever land troops on a planet like Hoth. You would just bomb the surface or destroy the entire planet and boom you have the end of that line of the story. A logical and much more likely outcome.
1.0,empire_strikes_back,"The best of the series. Darker than its predecessor, but even more enjoyable. Right from the start with the AT-ATs at the Battle of hoth it shows tremendous ambition. Darth Vader is a fantastic villain and the tooing and frowing between Leia and Solo adds some decent comedy"
1.0,empire_strikes_back,Amazing...My 2nd best film of all time behind of Citizen Kane. A childhood favorite and still is.
1.0,empire_strikes_back,In my not so humble opinion the most genuine due to its refreshing approach to the duality of man and its willingness to delve into uncharted territories and explore the darker side of man with such gusto and unbridled passion!

The sweet way that Charlie falls for Rose is something that only two wonderful actors can portray. The scene where Bogart imitates the hippos and makes her laugh is adorable.

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"John Huston filmed his World War I epic on location, which was an unusual decision at the time, but the grittiness and festering of the jungle perfectly matches the griminess of our main characters, played by Bogart and Hepburn."

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"The 1951 classic that won Humphrey Bogart an Oscar and inspired the Jungle Cruise at Disneyland was every bit as awesome as I had pictured it. The special effects are definitely of their time, but that doesn't stop it from being a timeless film."
1.0,the_african_queen_1951,The first of a series of boy meets girl and they take on the world. Once again a classic movie with two of the greatest actors to ever live. Joe versus the Volcano might be said to be a take off of AQ. Very loosely. Same struggles different picture.

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"A very good film, staring Audrey Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart. It's a romance with lots of action and some comedy in it; it's set durring WWI in Africa as they take a small boat, the African Queen, down a dangerous river in order to destroy a gargantuous German ship."

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"The relationship between Bogey and Hepburn is marvelous, as they first despise each other and then long for one another. Charlie Alnut is one of cinema's best characters, often overshadowed by Bogey's own Fred C. Dobbs. A trek well-worth the taking."
1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"There are a couple stars in each generation that steal our hearts so completely we'll watch anything they're in. Bogey and Kate are both such stars, and to see them together in a well-made (John Huston) film is a delight worth savoring again and again."

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,One of my all time favourites! The chemistry between Bogart and Hepburn is indescribable.

1.0,looper,"One of my top 20 best sci fi films. The story is absolutely killer. Screen writing is top notch, and the acting - just awesome! Bruce Willis & Joe Levitt are just killer. I Highly recommend this one."
0.0,looper,SWTLJ was so bad it carries over to his previous films as the root cause. Rian johnsons writing is subpar to George Lucas.
1.0,looper,Easily one of the best sci-fi movies in years. Superb

1.0,looper,"An incredible film with everything you could ask from it. The plot, characters and emotion are all stellar. It's not generic or forced in anyway. Highly recommended!"
1.0,looper,"Outstanding performances all around (led by the powerhouse duo of Gordon-Levitt and Willis), a genius script, and great direction-- Looper is a modern masterpiece."
1.0,looper,Awesome movie and criminally underrated.
1.0,looper,epic and groundbreaking as the first Matrix.
1.0,looper,awesome futuristic thriller Sci Fi and action rolled into one
1.0,looper,Well paced. Interesting storyline.
1.0,looper,"One the most entertaining and smart movies I have ever seen. Smart and not overly violent either. Great for anyone for anyone who is new to studying the art form of great cinema as its not mainstream at all, but can still be enjoyed absolutely by a regular audience."
1.0,looper,An excellent cast raises this movie to elite level behind a great plot and lots of thought provoking moments.
0.0,looper,Looper: Not quite the time travel story science fiction fans were hoping for & Bruce Willis doesn't die hard. What a fucking waste!

1.0,looper,Amazing movie! Not what I expected at all!! Very pleasant suprise! Would recommend to everyone!!!
0.0,looper,"Entirely predictable and cliched. Seen this story or a variant of it, a hundred times, its popularity baffles me,"
1.0,looper,Awesome Sci Fi thriller. Joseph gordan-Levitt and Emily Blunt stood out in their roles to me. That one scene where he falls from the porch was amazing. Also the cid's acting was surprisingly good. the story was cool and i loved the ending when he killed himself. It was a sad but necessary ending.
0.0,looper,so so so stupid the only way to get rid of a body in the future is to send it back in time ? come on if you could go back in time then it would be just as easy to disintegrate on. i know its only a movie but what a waste of time the science was all wrong

0.0,looper,"Real let down, enough of an idea for a short story, not a 2 hour film."
1.0,looper,"When you have two actors like Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis together in the same movie, nothing can go wrong. I was expecting a thrilling science fiction chase through time, but Looper gave me that... And much more."

1.0,looper,the new holy grail of sci-fi
0.0,looper,"What is everyone so excited about? Great filming and cutting, but this story is terrible and worthless, plenty predictable with its weak twists and uninteresting curves. The ending so many are excited about is not complex and painfully predictable."
1.0,looper,top time travel action thriller!
1.0,looper,One of the best modern science fiction movies. The symmetry of the film is nearly as beautiful as its character arcs.
1.0,looper,"Really good movie. Great action and effects, great story. Wonderful surreal entertainment. One of the best of the year in terms of pure fun and goofy situations and weird paradoxes. It was a pretty rad movie with a spectacular story and even more spectacular action scenes. Stunning."
1.0,looper,"Sure the time travel is wonky, but the movie is great none the less."
1.0,looper,"One of my favorite Sci-fi movies in recent years. Though decisions, good acting, and another great performance by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Different style and genre but one of my favorite time travel movies since Back to the Future."

1.0,looper,A great story. Thoroughly enjoyed this film. It was an interesting plot and engaging. Would recommend it.
0.0,looper,"Personally, I was not impressed. Good acting + good action, but the TT logic was just blah. For those who contemplate on theoretical time travel, the entire film was non sequitur; at least as far as my logic takes me. Lots of glitz & Glam with very little substance."
1.0,looper,"With Joseph Gordon-Levitt & Bruce Willis Both Giving Intense Performances, Looper Shows How To Darken The Usually Light Time Travel Genre."
1.0,looper,I could watch this movie over and over.
1.0,looper,"Great story, brilliant ending. They could have taken this to a sequel for the money, but ended it meaningfully instead. Loved it!"

0.0,looper,"Sorry, but this is toss. Strung-out seen-it-before time paradox obivousness that has been done far better in many a TV sci-fi, far more intelligently. Humanism, heroism, family-ism, horrorism boredom. Drink heavily before you watch and you might enjoy..."
1.0,looper,Amazing movie with one of the best endings ive seen in a long time! Sheer brilliance
0.0,looper,"unresolved plot holes , convoluted make-up , train wreck foul in all sense of the many words of stink. Made to look cool but it felt like watching a alcoholic mother abandoning her child to buy hot pants."
1.0,looper,I would add the movie in my top ten! I love Joseph Gordon-Levitt and above all Bruce Willis. The fact that they are in a movie together and they play EACH OTHER makes it that much better.

1.0,looper,Joseph Gordon Levitt.
1.0,looper,A fun ride from start to finish.
1.0,looper,"Rian Johnson is not your average filmmaker. Director of arguably the greatest television episode, ""Ozymandias"" from highly the acclaimed drama, Breaking Bad. Johnson delivers once again with a great film and top notch acting"

1.0,looper,Rian Johnson has yet to disappoint. This is his most layered film yet. Great story. Great acting. Great characters. Just plain great!
1.0,looper,"Another ""DON'T MISS"" Science Fiction thriller. Bruce Willis makes good choices most of the time (this is one). Emily Blunt is great as always and though this film contributed heavily to Joseph Gordon-Levitt's portfolio it's not his best performance (adequate)."
1.0,looper,One of the most original science fiction movies to come along in a very long time!!
1.0,looper,"We might find out some 'Time-Paradox', but during seeing, we're absorbed.Joe's last choice lets us think 'what is my life?'"
1.0,looper,"Excelente. El dominio con los movimientos de cámara fue preciso y una exquisita presentación para el espectador. El hecho de cruzar al veterano Willis con el ""joven"" Levit fue una gran jugada. Sin duda, una de las mejores películas de acción de los últimos años."

0.0,looper,"This film is a total mess. The concept and idea are very interesting. The pacing is very bad and the movie became boring after an hour. I didn't care about the characters, because there was so little character development... A missed potential."
1.0,looper,One of the best if not the best science fiction films of all time. But there's also a lot of emotion to the film which makes it that much better. Spectacular film!

1.0,dr_no,"Successfully introducing everything that makes Bond great, Dr. No remains one of the best entries of the franchise nearly 3 decades later. The villain is subtly menacing, and Sean Connery gives one of the best performances of his career."
1.0,dr_no,Classic Bond flick. One of my personal favorites. The boss fight scene at the end is a little lame but the Dr. No character is a mysterious character and provides a lot of intrigue.
1.0,dr_no,The first Bond film which was released quite a long time before my days is the first Bond film I've ever seen and it's one of my favorite.
1.0,dr_no,Perfect way to start this legendary franchise. Connery bosses it in his first appearance as Bond. Good cast around him too. Beautiful filming locations.
0.0,dr_no,"boring movie with no intense edge of your seat action, cliche capture and escape segment. bond also fights like a wuss, and isn't like a spy like a actual spy with fighting talent. doesn't matter if its made in 1963 was investing at all like the rest of the other bonds."

1.0,dr_no,"10 out of 10:Packed with plenty of action, great thrills, and a great performance from Connery, Dr No starts a franchise with a bang."
1.0,dr_no,This is the 1st James Bond movie. It is one of the best action movies from 1962. The 2nd James Bond From Russia with love is better. But still this is a good movie see it.
1.0,dr_no,The movie that started it all...
1.0,dr_no,Outstanding debut Bond work from the director and Sean. Particularly loved the creation of evil with Dr. No and the introduction of Spectre which came to a round circle in the recent crap of the same name.
1.0,dr_no,An absolute classic. Perfect in every way.

1.0,dr_no,"Bond, without the silliness that would not only define, but marr, the series eventually. Dr. No is a brilliant spy thriller, and Connery is sensational in his first outing with the character that would make him a star."
1.0,dr_no,What a way to kick the franchise off with a bang!
1.0,dr_no,"The inaugural Bond film sets a lofty precedent for its successors, in its beautiful encapsulation of those key elements which constitute the classic spy's adventures."

1.0,dr_no,Dr. No is a fantastic way to start the Bond franchise! Sean Connery is a great Bond. Hands down.
1.0,dr_no,Easily one of the best Bond movies in the series. Connery portrays Bond almost perfectly but nothing like he did in Goldfinger or From Russia With Love. Has all of the elements a Bond movie should be.
1.0,dr_no,"Dr. No is one of the better Bond films. It has quite a few goofs and a relatively slow pace, but there is plenty of atmosphere, an intriguing plot, great action sequences, and fantastic set design. It also set the standard for the James Bond films to come."

1.0,dr_no,"Fantastic. Fun, gritty and action packed with just the right amount of acceptable camp. Sean Connery will always be the best Bond."
1.0,dr_no,The start of a legend! This was a more subtle Bond film. Not heavy on the action. It focused more on the mystery and introduced 007 as a character. Good film.
1.0,dr_no,"The first installment that launched the James Bond series to where it is now, Dr. No is a fresh start to the series."
1.0,dr_no,"Sean Connery excels as the suave British agent sent to Jamaica to investigate a murder case, on the way encountering tough locals, the CIA, beautiful girls and of course the iconic titular antagonist."

1.0,dr_no,"Classic stripped down Bond. Suave intelligent and sophisticated, stylishly executed by the young Sean Connery. Oh and let's not forget Ursula's sexy performance too. Inevitably certain scenes look dated but it's such a classic It really doesn't matter in the bond world."

1.0,johnny_guitar,"One of the best westerns of the 1950's, a great decade for the genrre. Every aspect of the film is intelligent and boils with honesty from the screenplay to Nicholas Ray's subtle directing. Joan Crawford is outstanding and composes one of the least stereotyped woman characters ever seen on film."
1.0,johnny_guitar,La geste incroyable d'un immense realisateur. Johnny Guitar est a proprement parler terrassant.
1.0,johnny_guitar,"One of the best westerns ever, where the genre turns into tragedy and avoids its cliches. Unforgettable performances by Joan Croawford and Sterling Hayden, Nicholas Ray at his best and an astonishing work on photography by Harry Stradling, to support the weak Trucolor system."
