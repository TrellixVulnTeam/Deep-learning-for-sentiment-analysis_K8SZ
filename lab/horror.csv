1.0,1005339-dawn_of_the_dead,"Without Dawn of the Dead, no zombie film today would be what it is or might not even exist.

1.0,1005339-dawn_of_the_dead,Very good follow-up to Night of the Living Dead a decade later. Being a bit drawn out doesn't stop the thrills and horror.

1.0,1005339-dawn_of_the_dead,Romero's social approach on the aftermath of the zombie apocalypse. What modern zombie films inspired from its precursor. One of the best horror films in history.

1.0,1005339-dawn_of_the_dead,"Savagely subversive & timely. The genius of the film is that it gleefully juxtaposes images of commercial normalcy against brutality in service of obtaining luxury goods.... It's not the zombies who represent the vilest aspects of consumerism, here... it's the humans."

1.0,1005339-dawn_of_the_dead,"Romero's follow-up to Night of the Living Dead takes a very different approach by widening the scope and focusing more on fun than scares. Though the zombie makeup doesn't quite hold up, it is an incredibly efficient horror-thriller with social and political commentaries, and some disgusting fun."

1.0,1005339-dawn_of_the_dead,"The zombie movie.. Pure and simple. Social commentary, guns, bikes, undead and a helicopter. Yes it's dated now for its look but if you lived in the 80's you will still get it. Still a dames sight better than just about any undead flick ever made."

1.0,1005339-dawn_of_the_dead,Classic. The Cadillac of Zombie movies. I would suggest watching it after watching the remake. The guy who plays the Pastor on TV in the new one is the main black guy in the original. Cool cameo.

1.0,1005339-dawn_of_the_dead,"Dawn of the Dead is one of the best horror films ever made -- and, as an inescapable result, one of the most horrifying. It is gruesome, sickening, disgusting, violent, brutal and appalling."
1.0,1005339-dawn_of_the_dead,"Incredible, I wish I had this writers imagination. There aren't many zombie films out there anymore that have a story behind, this will forever be a zombie legend. Completely creepy and has a certain edge that makes you feel like locking the doors and windows.... like it will help haha"
1.0,1005339-dawn_of_the_dead,Excellent zombie movie. Just as god as the original for the most part. One of the best horror films of all time.

1.0,1005339-dawn_of_the_dead,The quintesential zombie flick and Romeros finest hour. This one never gets old.
1.0,1005339-dawn_of_the_dead,One of the best horror films of all time.
1.0,1005339-dawn_of_the_dead,In my opinion the greatest zombie film ever made. As the zombies begin to take over a small band set up home in an abandoned mall. But what else is out there besides the zombies?
1.0,1005339-dawn_of_the_dead,"By far my favorite zombie movie and believe me, I've seen tons! George A. Romero is a genius among film-making and this movie is a masterpiece!"

1.0,1005339-dawn_of_the_dead,This movie is also the shit
1.0,1005339-dawn_of_the_dead,"Great movie, the best of Romero's dead films. Zombies in a shopping mall,can't get any better than that. This truly is a cult film, and one of the best at that, with really bizarre music by an Italian rock group named Goblin and plenty of exploding heads and guts ripped out."
1.0,1005339-dawn_of_the_dead,One of the best films ever made.

1.0,1005339-dawn_of_the_dead,"Loved this film. If you like zombies, this is the 'godfather' of zombie flicks. The commentary on society, whether intentional or not, the fact that you laugh at the appearance of some of these zombies and just when you do, they rip your arm off. It keeps you on your toes."
1.0,1005339-dawn_of_the_dead,Nothing tops the classics..A Great Movie!

1.0,rosemarys_baby,"3º vez que assisto esse filme, continuo achando genial."
1.0,rosemarys_baby,"Not so much a horror film as pure suspense, Rosemary's Baby is a master tale of deception, betrayal and denial. The performances are awesome, Mia Farrow takes you on an emotional roller coaster. The film has an unsettling feel to it, but its not ""scary""."
1.0,rosemarys_baby,"Horror films don't get any better than this. One of my personal top 20 favorites horror films, and one of the few I recommend to non-horror fans. It's an excellent introductory or an awesome classic to watch over and over."
1.0,rosemarys_baby,"Incredibly tense and horrific throughout, despite its age. Roman Polanski clearly knows how to sustain dread. That said, this is an effed up movie, and really disturbing. Rosemary acts like a fool the entire time, digging her own grave. Clearly made with a pre-feminist sensibility."

1.0,rosemarys_baby,"To make its premise work Ã¢ÂÂ"" in other words, scare the hell out of you Ã¢ÂÂ"" Polanski had to get EVERYTHING right. And he did. From the first scene the viewer is drawn in, and there's no letting go, even when it's over."

1.0,rosemarys_baby,"John Cassavetes was such a great actor, as well as a great director."
1.0,rosemarys_baby,A particularly modern horror film that exploits particularly adult fears. Farrow's performance is charged with such a subtly growing desperation that we manage to feel terrified during scenes shot on crowded streets in broad daylight.
1.0,rosemarys_baby,Hale Satan! Hale Satan!-Brilliant writing. Extremely well made. Best horror film(only if you don't count Jaws as a horror movie)

1.0,rosemarys_baby,"Four Thumbs Up!!!!, A Classic Classic!!!. :-*"
1.0,rosemarys_baby,"Driven by Polanski's modern direction and a knock-out performance from Farrow, ""Rosemary's Baby"" is a terrifying story of a mother, her baby, and the friendly neighborhood satanist cult living next door."

1.0,rosemarys_baby,"A masterpiece. Mia Farrow made Rosemary's Baby the classic it is today, her acting is damn near flawless. One of the best horror films of all time, yet it really isn't too disturbing or scary. Rosemary's Baby is a slow-building, satanic work of art."
1.0,rosemarys_baby,Es tan oscura y posee una profundidad sofocante con cada plano.

1.0,rosemarys_baby,Brilliant cinematography. Certainly one of my favourite films.
1.0,rosemarys_baby,"Polanski's direction elevated the film beyond the material's potential schlock, shifting between dream imagery and reality so often that your never quite sure what's going on. Ruth Gordon and the rest of the building tenants are the quirkiest devil worshipers to ever grace the screen."
0.0,rosemarys_baby,wasnt even scary. boo.

1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,Really good movie very funny
1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,"Absolutely loved this flick.It's a bloody good time and a brilliant zombie movie.Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and writer/director Edgar Wright make an amazing team.Amazing comedic zombie flick."
1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,Probably my favorite move of all time.
1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,It balances horror and humour brilliantly which combined makes it one of the best zombie movies with movies like zombieland
0.0,shaun_of_the_dead,This film is neither funny or interesting. I thought Pegg and Frost did a great job in Hot Fuzz but this was very predictable and lazy. It was like they were not even trying. Such a great cast with Martin Freeman involved but sadly brought nothing to this film.
1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,The best mixture of comedy and horror. Ever.
1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,"Cheesy horror, lots of comedy, original zombies, instant classic!!! Its a perfect zombie comedy!!!"
1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,"Shaun of the Dead manages to mix a witty, satirical, funny script with graphic violence. No one really knows how, but it works, and Wright's new take on a cliched genre is refreshingly exuberant."
1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,The best film of the 00s.
1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,Watched it a million times and it never gets old. The humor is quite intelligent but the gore is there too to please the diehard zombie fans. I recommend everyone watch it atleast once.

1.0,shaun_of_the_dead,"While at the beginning you think it's going to be a funny Shaun Pegg movie about metophorical zombies instead of eat your brain zombies, this movie delivered in the laughs, scares and even the drama and action which is all better the second time."

1.0,dont_breathe_2016,"Don't Breathe is an intelligent, creative addition to the horror genre. The main characters are such rotten greedy people they almost deserved what the bad guy from Avatar did or didn't do to them, which makes it much easier for me, knowing I don't have to pick a side to cheer for."
0.0,dont_breathe_2016,"A boring ""thriller"" with predictable tropes, cheap jump scares and completely unlikeable characters. The fact that anyone can sit through this and think it's good has clearly been watching too many Hollywood blockbusters, if they can even be called that. I'm sorry, but this movie is trash."

0.0,dont_breathe_2016,The whole premise of this movie is stupid. A 65 year old blind veteran lives with his dog and is sitting on a pile of money. But he is able to overtake 3 intruders. Blind people are extremely feeble and portrating this guy as some sort of buff super villian is idiotic. Just a dumb movie.

0.0,altered_states,Just evolutionary garbage
1.0,altered_states,Great movie and they kept their facts straight... This movie explains to me alot about myself too.

1.0,altered_states,"Best an craziest and most intense movie I've ever seen about drugs. If you're into psychedelics, this one is for you. The moral is, don't delve too deeply into the secrets of the universe like they did in Raiders of the Lost Arc. This is the ultimate modern Faust story."

0.0,goodnight_mommy,"Warning without spoiling - torture porn passing itself off as an arty Austrian mystery/thriller. Very plodding and then cringe inducing in a bad way. And no resolution or explanation of what exactly happened and why, a film concept that can work, but doesn't in this instance. Not worth watching."
0.0,goodnight_mommy,Nothing seen here tells me this deserves any more than 1 star for trying...I thought it was awful.

0.0,goodnight_mommy,The little boy murders his mother. Unwatchable.
0.0,goodnight_mommy,Pure and simple this movie is awful. The twist is revealed in the first part of the movie. The rest is spent confusing you with scenes that go nowhere. It tries to create a sense of artsy doom and gloom. However it is overshadowed by other movies that create this feeling much better
1.0,goodnight_mommy,Minimalist suspense that cleverly builds on the eerie consequences of a family coping with tragedy.
1.0,goodnight_mommy,"A very disturbing movie with fantastic performances, a great score, and an incredibly ballsy ending. Well done"
0.0,goodnight_mommy,Torture Porn remake of 70's classic THE OTHER. Don't bother. Just go back and watch THE OTHER again. This one steals whole hog from that classic.

1.0,goodnight_mommy,"One of the things I like about horror movies is the atmosphere. This excels in atmosphere. It gets under your skin, right down to the lack of a musical score. And the third act is absolutely relentless. The Reviewer approves"

0.0,goodnight_mommy,?innocent child's play
0.0,goodnight_mommy,This movie is in no way a horror film. The twist is overly obvious within the first 8 minutes. After the bandages come off so does all reason. The film is simply a jumble of images that do nothing. Save yourself 1 2/3 hours and watch the Babadook.
0.0,goodnight_mommy,The twist is obvious in the first half hour. I don't understand how people were fooled. If you figure it out (which you should) the rest of the movie is pointless. No way is this even close to Babadook. And it's not a horror film.
1.0,goodnight_mommy,10/10 best movie ever.
0.0,goodnight_mommy,Tutorial for young psychopaths.
1.0,goodnight_mommy,"With intense emotional manipulation and dauntingly raw body-horror, Goodnight Mommy is a powerful exploration of a strong mother-child bond spiritually damaged by unforgiving heartbreaks. It has lingering effects, both by its disturbing visuals and its heart-rending narrative."
1.0,goodnight_mommy,I'm watching it tomorrow.
0.0,goodnight_mommy,I saw this movie before it came out. The trailer was captivating but as soon as you see the movie a whole different scene. This movie was complete garbage.. I DO NOT RECOMMEND FOR MY FORMER HORROR MOVIE PEOPLE..

1.0,nightmare_on_elm_street,This was the horror movie that got me really scared for a long while. Tips my hat to Wes Craven for this classic.
1.0,nightmare_on_elm_street,"And here I thought I'd been inundated with stills of the movie's popular setpieces my whole life, when there were scares and effects everyone kept quiet to disguise the full horror. We'll never get another (slasher) horror movie as good as this."
1.0,nightmare_on_elm_street,Very Good for a Slasher Horror Movie Classic that is in Color
1.0,nightmare_on_elm_street,"Horror movie classic. This movie will definitely scare you, or at least make you jump. The villain is awesome, and the whole idea is great. I loved the idea of brining him out of the dream world. Definitely worth the watch."
1.0,nightmare_on_elm_street,thsi is one of the best horror movies of all time. just forget the sequela and pretend they never happened and this is will remind you how terrifying nightmares really are.
1.0,nightmare_on_elm_street,loves this movie as a kid growing up scared the shit out of me 1 2 freddys coming for me 3 4 i better lock ur door 5 6 grab ur sticks
1.0,nightmare_on_elm_street,"Wes Craven's immortal classic earns it's place in horror history thanks to it's original premise, frightful atmosphere and Robert Englund's legendary performance and makeup as the icon Freddy Kruger"
1.0,nightmare_on_elm_street,I remember the first time I watched this movie. I refused to go to sleep for almost two days. Old school horror!
1.0,nightmare_on_elm_street,A must see for all horror fans and the very first to introduce a charismatic villain to the genre and will always be thanked for bringing Johnny Depp to the big time.
1.0,nightmare_on_elm_street,Holy shit! A fresh idea about a killer ghost who can kill you in your dreams! I actually had several Freddy nightmares from this original!
1.0,nightmare_on_elm_street,Absolutely terrifying. And occasionally hilarious. Full review later.
1.0,nightmare_on_elm_street,"Ahh yes, the film that started it all. Freddy Krueger is the reason I've become a horror fan. Damn Robert Englund played this role perfect. The concept of this film is brilliant and Freddy is a blast!"
1.0,nightmare_on_elm_street,Now I don't want to dream anymore.
1.0,nightmare_on_elm_street,My personal fav horror movie. Every kill was creative & I still don't understand why there's a debate between Freddy Michael & jason. 1 Freddy talks so that already puts him at the top for me. Weapon is better. & kills are creative because they're in a dream world. In short love this movie
1.0,nightmare_on_elm_street,My favourite horror series growing up..... Its still awesome!
1.0,nightmare_on_elm_street,"The ultimate classic slasher film! Great story and serial killer, no one will ever top Freddy!"

1.0,backcountry,Beautifully shot and compelling storyline of how one's ego gets everyone fooked.
0.0,backcountry,The worst movie I have seen in a while. There was close to no action- maybe 5 minutes in the whole movie. The focus was almost always blurry and the script was poorly written. This is not a horror or anything close to thrilling. The ending was very poor as well.
1.0,backcountry,If you spend any time in the deep woods ... and this movie doesn't grab your attention I don't know what will. Jaws did nothing to increase my pulse the next time I went scuba diving .... can't say the same about next time I'm backpacking in remote sections of PNW forest. .
1.0,backcountry,Excellent. Great acting. Perfect pace. Character development. Loved the moody approach - but it didn't go over the top trying to be artsy...
1.0,backcountry,"I was very impressed the suspense of the movie, would have never thought it was just about the bear. I thought it was a set up to kill her boyfriend, so it left me in dispense the whole time"

0.0,frankenweenie_2012,"Definitely a low point in the long list of films brought to you by Disney. Tim Burton does not know how to appeal to a younger audience, as shown also in his remake of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Very poor."
1.0,frankenweenie_2012,"With great visuals, excellent animation and 3D, chilling scares, an enjoyable story-line, and some great voice acting, ""Frankenweenie"" is a perfect film to check out for the Halloween season, and stands as Tim Burton's best film in the past few years."

1.0,frankenweenie_2012,"For this film, I believe Tim Burton has really outdone himself. The twists in the plot, the brilliant actors, the movie itself is incredible. I'd like to lose half a star just because of one of the characters, but I would never do that to FRANKENWEENIE."

1.0,frankenweenie_2012,"Tim Burton once again delivers an astonishing blow of stop-motion animation using colorless picture and strange, but also strong characterization."
1.0,1003625-carrie,"One of those strange cases where the movie surpasses the book in many ways. Both are great, but since my first contact with this story was the film, I prefer it better than the book. A matter of taste, I say."
1.0,1003625-carrie,Awesome horror what a classic
1.0,1003625-carrie,"Powerfully acted and shot to perfection, Brian De Palma's Carrie is a terrifying real look at what happens when bullying is pushed too far. Sissy Spacek's haunting portrayal of one of Stephen King's most famous characters is all the more haunting thanks to the famous prom night scene"

1.0,1003625-carrie,"While unsettling, the movie does find its way to the nostalgia and drama of the 1970's which is why it is one of my favorites. Just watching Carrie makes me never want to think of gym class again. Yikes."
1.0,1003625-carrie,"One of the most effective horror films without really being a horror film, like a lot of Stephen King's work. It's all about characters and tragedy rather than horror and it's difficult to not get caught up in it. A masterpiece from the great Brian De Palma."
1.0,1003625-carrie,"Rewatched the film after Halloween and I almost crapped myself by the film's end. The moral of the story, Don't mess with anyone who possess telekinesis. Don't even dump pig's blood on them. Not if you value your life. 10/10 for this Horror Classic"

1.0,1003625-carrie,"A beautifully shot horror movie. The cinematography captures the feel of both a beautiful, dizzying dream and a hellish nightmare. Sissy Spacek is amazing in the title role, capturing both painful awkward adolescence and the hateful rage of someone abused for far too long."

The mother and daughter relationship is amazing. Sissy spacek plays carrie with such emotion you feel it. The beginning stands on it's ground.
0.0,1003625-carrie,It was just an ugly movie. Everyone was annoying and the directing is terrible. #sorrynotsorry
1.0,1003625-carrie,"IT IS A CLASSIC: One of the best films ever made.It's beautifult, it's tragic, and it's terryfing, at the same time! Spacek and Laurie are brilliant, and the score of Pino Donaggio is a true masterpiece. This is how perfection looks like!"

1.0,1003625-carrie,"Creepy, tragic, sad... until well deserved retribution comes raining down... but the protagonist doesn't seem to be the object of the horror but the victim of it, the audience seems to stay on Carrie White's side."

0.0,1003625-carrie,Classick Stephen King story that takes way too long for the climax to happen. Like having sex for 3 days with a deflated blow up doll.
1.0,1003625-carrie,"Carrie is a true horror classic that is phenomenally acted, effectively scary, touchingly sad, and most importantly, memorable."

1.0,1003625-carrie,"From high school bullying to religious abuse, ""Carrie"" shows that anyone treated badly will have their payback. Tense acting, sad/dramatic moments, & eerie tones of hate & fear flow freely in this great [psychological] horror film by Brian DePalma."

0.0,1003625-carrie,sorry i think this movie sucks
1.0,1003625-carrie,"Is easily one of the best Stephen King movies. What makes it good is the writing. You feel bad for Carrie and you love it when she gets her revenge. That is what makes good writing, the characters and their personality."

1.0,1003625-carrie,This movie taught me to be nice to everyone and never bully anyone. This movie proves that bullying an innocent person who's trying to fit in may come with consequences!

1.0,1003625-carrie,That is an awsome movie
1.0,1003625-carrie,"This is classic horror at it's best. Siisy Spacek is absolutely amazing in this role. It's disturbing yet touching at the same time, as you really feel for Carrie's character. And talk about a great line... 'They're not dirty pillows mama! They're called breasts!!'"
1.0,1003625-carrie,"One of the best movies of the 70s, and far and away, Piper Laurie's most impressive role to date."
1.0,1003625-carrie,Sissy Spacek's best film. She could never beat this. A great film. When i first saw this i was quite young and didn't like it as it scared the hell out of me!!! But as i got older and watched it again i found what a great film it was and still is. I love it now.
1.0,1003625-carrie,This has to be one of the creepiest movies ever made. Disturbing images slowly crawl up your spine; you can actually feel the terror pilling up until it explodes at the adrenaline-fueled end. Spacek does a great job and DePalma's campy direction is steady.
1.0,1003625-carrie,Classic movie! Carrie is a great movie!
1.0,1003625-carrie,Be careful who you torture. They might just torture you right back.
1.0,1003625-carrie,"I just love Sissy in this movie, and not to mention that John T is totally hot."

1.0,1003625-carrie,Stephen King! Absolute creepy classic! Love it!
1.0,1003625-carrie,Truly a classic although I don't consider it a horror movie but more of a thriller-drama cult classic and the acting was effortless.
1.0,1003625-carrie,Saw this on the big screen and met Piper Laurie. Woo!
1.0,1003625-carrie,carrie is an insane horror films and I loved it.
1.0,1003625-carrie,"One of the best horror movies ever. Emotional, creepy and terrifying. Carrie has everything a moviegoer can ask."
1.0,1003625-carrie,"Probably the best acting in any film ever, people just don't notice due to its age and lack of publicity. A masterpiece that only a fool would condemn."
1.0,1003625-carrie,"Ah, the happy, cheerful and highly formative teenage school days. Carrie White, you'll always be my #1 gal."

1.0,1003625-carrie,DePalma at his best and Sissy Spacek nails the character of Carrie. The prom scene is perfectly constructed and ranks among the best horror / suspense moments in movie history.
1.0,1003625-carrie,"A Stephen King classic from a great director, ""Carrie"" pulls you in by having you relate with its theme of high school angst and stress, then beating you over the head with its insane ending. Highly recommended."
1.0,1003625-carrie,carrie is an insane horror films and I loved it.
1.0,1003625-carrie,"One of my top 5 favorite films ever. So well-directed and acted. Moving, scary, intense and suspenseful. Will never forget my first viewing of this classic."

0.0,1003625-carrie,Terrible scary movie
1.0,1003625-carrie,So good. A DePalma classic. Spacek is good at played molly-coddled religious girls that break out of their sheltered life styles and subsequently wreak all sorts of havoc.
1.0,1003625-carrie,Omg I love this mOvie so much lol
1.0,1003625-carrie,"dang this movie was freaky whenever the mother appeared, and the beginning and the last bit wasn't scary but intense. a really well made horror"

1.0,spring_2015,wow the score the plot and the acting were just beautiful.

1.0,spring_2015,"Real chemistry, great photography and music, clever story, I am still thinking about it."
0.0,spring_2015,No surprises in this surprisingly dull and boring film. The girl is pretty but neither her nor the male lead had an ounce of personality. Could someone explain the ending.
1.0,spring_2015,Great movie. More scifi than horror though.
1.0,spring_2015,A weird blend of romance and horror that works out brilliantly.
0.0,spring_2015,"Seriously, ignore the tomatoes rating, this is a truly awful film. Nothing happens, repeat, NOTHING!! I want my time back."
1.0,spring_2015,It's pretty friggin dope. It's like a thriller/romance/sci-fi thingy that wasn't your typical storyline. I liked it a lot--hope you catch it soon!

1.0,the_conjuring_2,based on a true story. this part 2 is based on the paranormal expriences that happen to a young single mother family in England. its creepy. its spooky. its a little bit over the top but in the end there is a message and a mystery behind it all.

1.0,the_conjuring_2,"This sequel (more or less based on actual events) pretty much has it all. It´s creepy as h_ll - literally - and is so well made and balanced in every aspect it leaves at least me in awe. Clinging to a pillow, with the lights and radio on, too shaken up to fall asleep..."
1.0,the_conjuring_2,this movie is very scary

1.0,the_conjuring_2,best horror I have ever seen hands down!!!
1.0,the_conjuring_2,A great sequel to the first one. The first one was terrifying and creepy and this one follows directly in its footsteps.
1.0,the_conjuring_2,"I believe that in some point Hollywood transformed truth into movie, but how about the demon woman that haunted the family? IS she also was really seen?"
1.0,the_conjuring_2,"I am normally the person who is displeased with scary movies, but after watching this in theaters, my boyfriend and I drove home in utter silence. I'm 22 years old and still had nightmares about this film. Extremely well-done."
1.0,the_conjuring_2,"I felt like it surpasses the original completely, based on the scare factor and fleshing out the characters better."
1.0,the_conjuring_2,I liked this one better than the first one.
1.0,the_conjuring_2,I literally have to leave and stand in the theater hallway a couple of times. Crapping my pants. The scariest movie I have ever seen. Hands down.
1.0,the_conjuring_2,"I like all of them,good movies."
1.0,the_conjuring_2,"Conjuring 1 & 2 have been my favorite Paranormal movies. The first was better. This took place in England so the apartment wasn't as scary as a big old creaking house! It's suspenseful, fresh and scary. Whole plot had a twist unexpected. I rented this and went and bought it on DVD."
1.0,the_conjuring_2,Couldn't have been more perfect.
1.0,the_conjuring_2,Now this is a horror film! Worth every penny. Worth every minute. Way scarier than the 1st. Definitely watchin this more than once.

1.0,the_conjuring_2,"Absolutely terrifying, had nightmares for ages after watching this, way scarier than the first, more scares and the cast you could tell were pushed to their limits with this one and loved that bits of the insidious franchise creeped through, well deserved as a instant horror classic."
1.0,the_conjuring_2,"A great sequel to the 2013 film, which was awesome."
0.0,the_conjuring_2,"A standard contemporary jump horror, with no real surprises if you've watched any classic horror films from the 70s/80s. If you're looking for a film to scare you with purposefully narrow camera angles and poor character decisions, you've come to the right place."
0.0,the_conjuring_2,The ratings are nostalgia and not reflective of the actual movie. IMHO it wasn't worth the $1.50 I rented it for in Redbox... worse still is I'll never get my evening back. You are warned.
1.0,the_conjuring_2,A fantastic horror film!
0.0,the_conjuring_2,It wasn't very subtle. lack of depth and storyline. didn't leave much to the imagination nor the climax. if you like premature ejaculations and the conjuring. this is your baby. smells as bad too.

1.0,young_frankenstein,"It's hilarious, with timeless gags and and an insanely funny performance by Gene Wilder, but it's also a loving tribute to the golden age of horror."
1.0,young_frankenstein,Easily one of my favorite movies. Most people notice more gags after watching it several times I have found. Truly hilarious and dry humour that works very well.

1.0,the_host_2007,"THIS is seriously a brilliant horror flick. Colorful, 3-dimensional characters that remain grounded whether the tone shifts from dramatic to scary to comedic, a plot that goes beyond what you would expect and even some sensitive family drama.

1.0,nosferatu,"One of the best films of all time, it was a master piece shot in the style of German Expressionism. It utilised several techniques such as stop motion and foreshadowing. The story itself was a loose adaptation of Dracula though the creepy effect is still haunting even till today."

1.0,nosferatu,Stephanie Meyer needs to watch this!!
1.0,nosferatu,"Amazingly eerie and frighteningly alive despite the limitations of this silent era of filming. I am a lover of all things horror, and this movie fit the bill very well. The creepiness of Nosferatu still works even in 2014, where there is a high standard for horror."

1.0,nosferatu,very cool to see something that old.
1.0,nosferatu,"Wonderfully acted and hauntingly shot, Murnau's horror epic still retains its power nearly 100 years (!) after it was made. Hilariously, considering the circumstances under which it was made, it also might be the best film adaption of ""Dracula"" to date."
1.0,nosferatu,"It's a classic, what's not to love."
1.0,nosferatu,"Schreck plays the eponymous vampire with an almost savage simplicity, and teamed with Murnau's striking and frightful visual storytelling created some of cinema's most lasting and haunting imagery. While not out and out terrifying, Nosferatu is eerily spooky and chilling."

1.0,nosferatu,95% The makeup for Nosferatu is astounding for a film this old.
1.0,nosferatu,Bram Stoker's Dracula in a German silent film with Hans Erdmann doing the score is the ideal combination for instant horror success. Vampire culture meets the big screen for the first time in this historic gem. Look for this online as it will be hard to find.

1.0,misery,Forget the fact that it's not as dark or gruesome as the book. This film is a testament to the genre. Kathy in particular captures the insanity of a super fan. Probably her finest performance. James also puts in a most terrific performance too as the helpless victim.

1.0,misery,"Amazing acting from Cathy Bates and James Caan. Can't argue how good this film is, even without as much action as other Stephen King adaptions, such a good twist at the start, as James Caan is Isolated and Immobiled he must escape from mad man, or in this case, mad woman, Kathy Bates. Great film."

1.0,psycho,"A real horror treat, that keeps you on your toes and creeps you out. Hitchocock at his finest."

1.0,psycho,I saw it again and it's still just as great as it always has been.
1.0,psycho,"Still very powerful film, even at 50 years plus old. The shower scene has to be the most iconic, alongside possibly King Kong on the Empire State Building, scene in Hollywood history."

1.0,psycho,maybe the most thrilling film in my movie experience history. Hail Hitchcock!

1.0,1007602-fly,Body horror masterpiece that makes modern CGI tear its fingernails out in comparison.
1.0,1007602-fly,"Wow, What a movie....."
1.0,1007602-fly,"The Fly is hard to watch, in a good way. If anybody knows the grotesque, it's Cronenberg. The effects are spectacular, but they are also built on a tragic tale of Hubris. The Fly is a great film and I would highly recommend it."
1.0,1007602-fly,"Combining the story, David Cronenberg's directing, Jeff Goldblum's performance, and Howard Shore's moody underscore result in a masterpiece in entertaining cinema. Take a dive into the plasmapool."

1.0,1007602-fly,Disturbing film to say the least. Special effects are absolutely incredible. An absolute classic of the horror genre. 5 stars. Today's films are not a patch on this. The makeup special effects were so scary compared to today's computer methods.
1.0,1007602-fly,A horror classic with great visuals and a great performance by Jeff Goldblum.
1.0,1007602-fly,"Fantastic performances with both over the top and gross practical effects,"

1.0,1007602-fly,"You wouldn't expect a movie called The Fly to be any good. Well, you would be so wrong. It is gross, but beautiful at the same time. Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis are both terrific, and, of course, the makeup and the puppetry flawless. A definite must-see."

1.0,1007602-fly,Cronenberg's best work is a tragic horror masterpiece with spot-on characterization. [A+]
1.0,1007602-fly,"In the breed of horror films that rely on bizarre, disgusting special effects, well-written characters and unexpectedly moving humanity make The Fly a supreme one."
1.0,1007602-fly,The culmination of the first phase of Cronenberg's career ... his pure horror film phase. All of the recurring elements and themes of his career are expressed in their purest form. A masterpiece.
1.0,1007602-fly,There is a scene where a woman gives birth to a maggot.

1.0,1007602-fly,For all its 80's flaws this is possibly my favourite horror. The plot been done many times before and since but cutting edge for its time and still watchable today (if you can ignore the mullets and shoulder pads).
1.0,1007602-fly,"Perhaps Cronenberg's finest work (Dead Ringers being a close 2nd). This complex story is effortlessly woven together with genuine scares, which in the hands of any other Director, could easily spell disaster."

1.0,1007602-fly,This is how you make a monster movie.
1.0,1007602-fly,"So sparse and with so few characters this could make an effective stage-play. This slow disintegration, both physically and morally, of a good man make this an effective, visceral and moving horror/tragedy. Might just be Cronenberg's best work."

1.0,1007602-fly,"A film that is horrifying, shocking and heart-wrenching. A love story gone wrong during the a scientific discovery. Not so much a remake as a reinvention itself. It takes the original concept and weaves it into a new creation. It excels in every way imaginable."

1.0,1007602-fly,I find it depressing that nothing in 25 years has yet to be as horrifyingly macabre as this film. Cronenberg really was the master.
1.0,1007602-fly,One of the greatest remakes ever made. The effects are out of this world. It's just proof that practical effects will always be better than CGI. Also Jeff Goldblum's best performance.
1.0,1007602-fly,For me they actually outdid the original film. That is a rarity with remakes. They did a great job of putting a modern setting to the old 1950's version. The changes they made in the plot were improvements that made it more interesting. The acting is excellent as well.
1.0,1007602-fly,"See a regular research scientist go from Seth Brundle to maniac Brundlefly, Cronenberg manages to turn this silly concept into a story of romance tragedy that will leave you with a truly affecting finale."

1.0,1007602-fly,"A disgusting and terrifying examination of the transformation of man to beast. This film is an instant classic to horror lovers and sci-fi fanatics, for Cronenberg has created a masterpiece that meets in the middle for these two genres."

1.0,1007602-fly,I can't believe I hadn't seen this before. MY NEW FAVORITE FILM!
1.0,1007602-fly,"A favorite, especially from Cronenberg! Incredible effects, great performances. Interesting to watch someone degrade, mentally and physically... Cronenberg is great at showing the body turn against itself."
1.0,1007602-fly,Where is Spiderman when you need him?Jeff Goldblum is not very convincing in his role of a human being. But his fly is breathtaking.
1.0,1007602-fly,"Another Cronenberg movie. Main themes of his movie, sex scenes between unattractive people, in this movie Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis. Other elements gore and extremely weird story, but really, really good."
1.0,1007602-fly,great but very disgusting
1.0,1007602-fly,"Amazing how this movie is so sad, yet its full of horror. this without doubt the best remake ever!"
1.0,1007602-fly,"The Fly has brilliant direction, great characters, wonderful performances and fantastic makeup effects."
1.0,1007602-fly,Five stars for good special effects and Jeff Goldblum's freaky fly disposition. Very good 80s film :)
1.0,1007602-fly,best.horror movie.EVER!!!!!!!!
1.0,1007602-fly,"Very, very haunting. One of my favorites."
1.0,1007602-fly,That is some scary shit man......
1.0,1007602-fly,"Disgusting, scary, and very tragic. Jeff Goldbum should've won an Oscar for this."
1.0,1007602-fly,"Disturbing,Gruesome,Unique and one of the best in concept.Highly recommended."
1.0,1007602-fly,greatest ending ever!
1.0,1007602-fly,the fly had strong and horrifying gore but really strong characters and emotionsit had the most gruesome and horrific human to bug transformation that ive ever seen since men in black with the farmer dude turnin from man to big ass roach
1.0,1007602-fly,"A Sci-fi horror masterpiece! ""It mated us, me and the fly. We hadn't even been properly introduced"""
1.0,1007602-fly,A perfect sci-fi film that hatches into a perfect horror film that ends up a traumatic tragedy.
1.0,1007602-fly,When i say the first fly with Vincent Price i thought it was a great movie. Yet comparing the 1958 The Fly to the 1986 The Fly they are 2 different movies that go in 2
1.0,1007602-fly,"Cronenberg's best to date. A surprisingly deeply affecting tragedy, with Goldblum ironically turning out a very human performance. The Fly is Science Fiction(and Sci-Fi Horror) at some of its very best.  5 Stars."
1.0,1007602-fly,Next to The Thing this is the best horror/transformation film ever.
1.0,1007602-fly,One of Cronenberg's best films (but I have several other favourites that top this). What's not to love. The effects are insanely good. And what befalls Seth is great. A great remake.
1.0,1007602-fly,"David Cronenberg is one of my top favorite directors. I wish he would return to the horror genre. Jeff Goldblum puts on a stellar performance. A great re-make, even better than the Vincent Price original."
1.0,1007602-fly,Classic sci-fi / horror. Jeff Goldblum gives a phenomenal performance and Cronenberg combines this tragic romance with gruesome gore in a very entertaining way.
1.0,1007602-fly,"This remake of the 1958 classic may not be for the fainthearted, but it's simply beautiful and very inspiring."
1.0,1007602-fly,Tied for my 5th favourite movie along with Seven; and Reservoir Dogs
1.0,1007602-fly,"Gross,Horrifying and sad,Its one of the best movies realesed in the 80's in my opinion"
1.0,1007602-fly,"Horrifying, fascinating, tragic. I actually cried at the end. My date wasn't too thrilled about THAT. She didn't want another date. It was worth it, though. Davis and Goldblum were great."
1.0,1007602-fly,We get a woman's right to autonomy juxtaposed with a completely different type of 'right to life'. 'The Fly' is a crazy remake that only someone as diabolically genius as Cronenberg can pull off. Classic.
1.0,1007602-fly,The Fly is one of the few pure horror classics that will continue to stand the test of time
1.0,1007602-fly,lol hard to believe that a movie about a 'man/fly' could transcend camp :) or does it? :p
0.0,1007602-fly,toootally forgot about this movie and it's awesome special effects until it popped up on this 'quickrate'
1.0,1007602-fly,Still one of the best
1.0,1007602-fly,A remake that is actualyl pretty damn good. Goldblum is amazing as Seth Brundle. DO NOT REMAKE THIS NICOLAS CAGE!!!!!
1.0,1007602-fly,"Oh my god, this film scared the crap out of me!"
1.0,1007602-fly,probably one of the greatest god damn horror remakes ever. Jeff Goldblum's obsessed character plunges you back the the classic perspective of the mind of a man going thru madness.
1.0,1007602-fly,"Although this is a remake of the classic 50s movie with Vincent Price, Cronenberg takes it in a whole new direction, and makes it his own. I loved it."
1.0,1007602-fly,"the effects in this movie are awsome. highly recommended. a movie about a scientist who turns himself into a human fly. way better than it sounds and probably the best movie about a mad scientist out there along with the re-animator. highly recommended, watch this!"
1.0,1007602-fly,Possible one of the most tragic and yet beautiful Love Stories ever
1.0,1007602-fly,One of the greatest remakes of all time. Cronenberg's take on a love story is so fantastic yet so gross.
0.0,1007602-fly,I only remember a little bit of this movie but it gave me nightmares as a kid. It's Horrible!
1.0,1007602-fly,Some people say that Jeff Goldblum always plays Jeff Goldblum in his films. Well this is the Jeff Goldblum that he plays! Fantastic Sci-Fi nightmare.

1.0,1007602-fly,"Jeff Goldblum has some really bizarre yet funny dialogue as he starts becoming more and more fly-like. ""I want to be the first insect politician."""
1.0,1007602-fly,Watched the fly just now. Haven't seen this movie since I was like 16 years old! I didn't remember how disgustingly gory this movie is! Ick!

1.0,1007602-fly,PICK OF THE WEEK. A classic! In honor of the innocent love that brews during the summer months.
1.0,1007602-fly,One of the best horror movies ever made. Goldblum deserved an Oscar...
1.0,1007602-fly,"Not as scary as I thought it would be, but it is gruesome. One of my favorite horror films."
1.0,1007602-fly,"Still one of my top 5 best thrillers ever!! Claustrophobic, freaky, biological terror, great performances, this is like a bad nightmare that you cant wake up! The mechanical effects are way better than any CGI and give a tone of realism. Amazing movie"
0.0,1007602-fly,And from the Telepod came Brundlefly.
1.0,1007602-fly,Five stars for good special effects and Jeff Goldblum's freaky fly disposition. Very good 80s film :)
1.0,1007602-fly,"Not Cronenberg's best (Videodrome is unbeatable), but an amazing film nonetheless and one of the greatest remakes of all time."
1.0,1007602-fly,David Cronenberg's remake of the 50's camp classic is superior in every way.

1.0,ginger_snaps,"Working as both a solid werewolf venture and allegory for puberty and hormonal changes, Ginger Snaps is one of the smartest and most original horror movies of the 2000s. [A]"
1.0,ginger_snaps,"As horror movies go, this is a real treat. These aren't your typical sisters and this isn't your typical werewolf movie. I only wish its sequels were as good!"
1.0,ginger_snaps,Such a great werewolf story! I loved the juxtaposition between the werewolf curse and the main characters menstrual cycle. I also loved the creature design and special effects!
1.0,ginger_snaps,"A great cult film. Perkins and Isabelle have such great chemistry, they're witty and opposite enough to clash perfectly. Great practical effects and score. My favorite werewolf film."
1.0,ginger_snaps,Highly recommended this movie was hilarious one of the best I've seen in awhile. The movie should be considered a horror movie classic that should NEVER be overlooked May 26 2014
1.0,ginger_snaps,Unforgettable series
1.0,ginger_snaps,It has the most terrifying and heart-breaking ending that I have ever seen.

0.0,ginger_snaps,This movie is fucking terrible. If I figured who suggested this movie to me I will punch them in the trachea.
1.0,ginger_snaps,My favorite werewolf movie by a mile maybe even my favorite horror movie to be honest. Extremely clever and very funny also I like how it uses lycanthropy as a metaphor for puberty. If you haven't seen this film I urge you to seek it out it's a smart and insanely entertaining werewolf cult classic.
1.0,ginger_snaps,In my opinion the best werewolf movie ever.
1.0,ginger_snaps,"I really liked this movie. Characters were very original and the storyline was great and kinda out of nowhere. The characters and the actors drive this movie, and they do a great job indeed, they do not take themselves to seriously and they just make the movie fun."
1.0,ginger_snaps,One of the best series invented.
1.0,ginger_snaps,"I loved it. It works up to the climax smoothly, no plot holes, it was great. I was dying to see it again as soon as I finished."
1.0,ginger_snaps,One of the first werewolf films I fell in love with. Soooo understated. One of my all time favorites. The whole trilogy is pretty baddass. I always wanted them to make just one more though. Emily Perkins and Katherine Isabelle were so perfectly cast for the characters. Hhhooooowwwwlllll
1.0,ginger_snaps,"I was really surprised, by the name I expected it to be another dumb slasher movie, far from it."
1.0,ginger_snaps,A brilliant dark comedy horror based on the confusion between the effects from a monster bite and menstruation. Also an excellent strong female cast. 5/5
1.0,ginger_snaps,A great new spin on the werweolf genre. Also very deep for a horror film and really makes you feel bad for the man chracters.
1.0,ginger_snaps,"Absolutely fabulous, and this movie needs to become a cult classic. Very dark, sometimes funny and deeply touching tale of two sisters."
1.0,ginger_snaps,This movie was fucking awesome. I can't wait to see how they continue it in the next movie.

1.0,ginger_snaps,Instant classic! This film has everything I want in a horror flick.
1.0,ginger_snaps,Excellent horror movie. I think it's the best in the whole series. Wonderful acting.
1.0,ginger_snaps,"Wonderfully set in unflinching reality. Finally takes a gritty unromantic view at a werewolf story. With some nice undertones of symbolism about menstruation, and the relationship of two sisters as they grow into womanhood."
1.0,ginger_snaps,Great film. Just downloaded the 2nd hope it's as good as the first. A great werewolf film.
1.0,ginger_snaps,disturbed teens battling with transforming into a fucking wereworlf while a pot head tries to save her. i love it.

1.0,ginger_snaps,Not your average werewolf movie.
1.0,ginger_snaps,"A brilliant and original take on the werewolf genre. Isabelle and Perkins are brilliant as outsider sisters Ginger and Brigitte, and bring out the scripts dark humour perfectly."
1.0,ginger_snaps,"A far better film than you would think, this is undoubtedly the smartest teen horror film out there, and in and of itself, a fantastic, thrilling and endearingly clever werewolf flick."

0.0,ginger_snaps,This movie can go to hell.
1.0,ginger_snaps,"A tale of two sisters...two sisters with a bond so strong it can almost overcome lycanthropy. ...Almost. ;) lol Great horror flick with no random and senseless nudity and believable characters. If you get into characters like I do, though, you'll have a love/hate relationship with the ending."
0.0,ginger_snaps,"Lame. Like, really really lame. Hardly any werewolf action, and when there is, it's mostly in the dark and you can't see anything. Didn't like the ending, coulda been so much better. It's mostly about 2 sisters who seems to love each other a bit too much, and periods. Strange..."
1.0,ginger_snaps,"J'ai pas encore cÃ´ter ce film? Bordel, il faut que vous voyez ce CHEF-D'OEUVRE!Le meilleur film de loup-garou et teen coming-age.

1.0,ginger_snaps,"I watched this last night on IFC. Came on at Midnight til 2am. I was ALL ALONE....I loved this movie. Not your typical werewolf story. VERY trippy and had me thinking about it until 3am. Up til now I had only seen snips and pieces, but watching the entire movie definately made me a fan."

1.0,ginger_snaps,"""The"" best werewolf specific movie I have ever seen. An interesting exploration of ""The Change"" both from human-to-werewolf and girl-to-woman. There's a dry wit to this movie that really struck a chord with me. And it really has been a favourite amongst my movie collection."
1.0,ginger_snaps,Perhaps the best thought out and convincing werewolf story ever! The characters are not one dimensional gore fodder but ones who we can empathise with! With my favourite actree Emily Perkins at the helm amounts to one of my fave films!

1.0,1016240-phantom_of_the_opera,"After all these years, Phantom of The Opera stands the test of time as a tragedy of a character who just wants to be accepted by others despite his appearances. So sad, yet very masterful"
1.0,1016240-phantom_of_the_opera,"What an amazing movie! Cinematically perfect with an awsome villan, an awsome setting, and it's Lon Chaney with his own makeup, and wow what an amazing job he did. This has to be my favorite horror movie of all time!"

1.0,1016240-phantom_of_the_opera,Unlike Nosferatu I found the ending of Phantom of the opera to fit perfectly with what was going on. This is a great silent film that any horror fan should have at least tried to watch at one point or another.
1.0,1016240-phantom_of_the_opera,"A movie that has represented horror in its most memorable gothical nature.

1.0,1016240-phantom_of_the_opera,"My first reaction was 'Wow!' There is so much more to this film than the unmasking at the organ. There are flashes of humor, the Red Death and even some snorkeling. Fantastically iconic, or iconically fantastic - whichever you prefer."

1.0,1016240-phantom_of_the_opera,"The most accurate adaption of Gaston Leroux novel. Featuring the uncanny Lon Chaney as Eric the phantom, in perhaps his most famous role in which he applied his notorious signature make ups. Brilliantly played out and filmed as well as a moving story."
1.0,1016240-phantom_of_the_opera,"The original phantom film and still yet no other film, with added special effects could ever compare with the silent Chaney, as his extraordinary talents shatters your heart and makes you cry in one of the best movies of all"

1.0,1016240-phantom_of_the_opera,The classic that all remakes are measured against. Even with no sound it's impact is dramatic.
1.0,1016240-phantom_of_the_opera,"Lon Chaney's definitive take on Gaston Leroux's trash novel. Chaney is a mastermind of movement and gesture, one of the great geniuses of cinema history. When that mask comes off, even the cameraman can barely believe it."

1.0,1016240-phantom_of_the_opera,"I love both the original version (no sound) and the later re-release with the soundtrack by Switchblade Symphony. Mary Philbin is absolutely heartbreaking as Christine, and the whirling dancers who get the spins everytime they get startled are always good fun. :)"
0.0,1016240-phantom_of_the_opera,"I actually saw the musical, not the movie, so I really can't comment. I know my dad liked the musical. They had awesome pyrotechnics, and even though I was on the balcony, I remember feeling like my eyebrows might burn off, that was pre-Great White."

1.0,1016240-phantom_of_the_opera,"Along with Nosferatu, the best horror movie of the silent era. Lon Chaney, next to Robert Englund, was the best actor to ever play Erik. Not only that but hes deformed as hell. So thats a plus for the Leroux purists."

1.0,1016240-phantom_of_the_opera,A classic film that gets better with age. Every horror connoisseur should have this in their collection. No film adaptation has come close to this. Lon Chaney's phantom is truly scary.

1.0,1016240-phantom_of_the_opera,Lon Chaney = PURE GENIUS. Enough said.
1.0,1016240-phantom_of_the_opera,The man of a thousand faces had his most famous role in this silent film.  This outdoes any Phantom adaptation that has come since. The colour for the Red Death scene was great.
1.0,1016240-phantom_of_the_opera,Excellent! You really should find a theatre (with a live organ) showing this.

1.0,1016240-phantom_of_the_opera,This version captures the atmosphere of the novel better than all the others combined. Try to see it in a haunted movie palace with an organist improvising off Bach's Tocatta and Fugue in d minor.

1.0,evil_dead_2_dead_by_dawn,"Truly superior over the first film, Evil Dead II improves as the best in the series because it's scarier, cheesier, and an epic joyride. Almost like Raimi made a better Evil Dead that looked better. Really is an incredible horrific tale."
1.0,evil_dead_2_dead_by_dawn,"Mas que una secuela, Sam Raimi realizo un re-make de su propia pelicula con un mayor presupuesto, mayor creatividad y mayor demencia. El resultado es una grandiosa pelicula clase B que lo mantendra al borde de su silla de principio a fin."
1.0,evil_dead_2_dead_by_dawn,"You will laugh. It is hilarious in such a good way. Iconic: Chainsaw, Double Barrel, GROOVY."
0.0,evil_dead_2_dead_by_dawn,Im very much in the minority it seems with thinking this movie is a complete waste of time. The attempt to bring Evil Dead up to date with a bigger budget and better effects just falls flat as far as Im concerned. All the charm of the original is lost to a dated mess of over undulgence.
1.0,evil_dead_2_dead_by_dawn,It's impossible to watch this film and not be entertained! With so much outlandish cinematography/special effects and the crazed performance of Bruce Campbell you won't know whether to scream or laugh.
1.0,evil_dead_2_dead_by_dawn,"It's equally as good as the original, and that makes it one of the best sequels ever made."

1.0,evil_dead_2_dead_by_dawn,Okay there's no tree rape scene like the 1st movie but this movie is still amazing. Fav bit is defo when the chainsaw arm gets made and attached! Can't wait to watch 'Army of the Dead' tomorrow night!
1.0,evil_dead_2_dead_by_dawn,"Easily the most fun I've ever had watching a horror film. The laughs and scares are both plentiful and expertly spaced out, leaving viewers with excitement and suspense."

1.0,evil_dead_2_dead_by_dawn,"Bigger, better, and scarier than the original. A masterpiece and an absolute must-watch."
0.0,evil_dead_2_dead_by_dawn,Some time sequels should not be made. This is one of those instances. With a increased budget it seems like the only thing they were focused on was special effects. They should of been focused on acting and a story line instead of pointless fantasy horror that made no sense.
1.0,evil_dead_2_dead_by_dawn,"How the hell have I not seen this until now? Easily one of my favorite horror movies ever...I mean you can't go wrong here. It was over the top, funny, awesome and I think I love this trilogy. Cult classic for sure and my favorite of the 3."

1.0,evil_dead_2_dead_by_dawn,"The first Evil Dead film doesn't offer anything other than great fun, 'Evil Dead 2' offers the same but double the amount. Although I didn't get it as a satire, I still think it's immensely fun, unobtrusive and scary."
1.0,evil_dead_2_dead_by_dawn,"Some say The Godfather, Casablanca or Vertigo. And then theres Evil Dead 2."
1.0,evil_dead_2_dead_by_dawn,This is how horror flicks should be made.  Just basically what people should watch together for a good time.

1.0,evil_dead_2_dead_by_dawn,"the energy of this film rarely lets up, its a great bloody time"
1.0,evil_dead_2_dead_by_dawn,"Raimi + Cambpell = Perfection. The best horror of all time (and its not even really a horror movie). The perspective angles that Raimi uses to show the views of random inanimate objects(the axe, the hand, etc.) are at first a little odd, but become hilarious."
0.0,evil_dead_2_dead_by_dawn,"This quasi remake almost undoes everything Raimi did in the first, which wasn't much, making a joke if itself the entire time."
1.0,evil_dead_2_dead_by_dawn,Horror comedy sequel which is better than the original.

1.0,evil_dead_2_dead_by_dawn,"This was a great movie. Very cool, pretty funny, again not scary, just very gory. Not quite as good as first, but still excellent. Couple of story flaws and inconsistencies very irritating, but otherwise very good. Great performance from Campbell."
1.0,evil_dead_2_dead_by_dawn,"The last time I was watching this film. I had it on so loud that my dad asked me if I'm watching a movie with screaming in it. I had to turn it down a bit, but hell, I enjoyed it"

1.0,evil_dead_2_dead_by_dawn,"This movie is great, it is bloody,scary,funny at times and maybe better than the first movie"
1.0,evil_dead_2_dead_by_dawn,A wildly shot masterpiece with manic acting and masterfully innovative monster moments. This time the hilarity of the action and the dialogue is an intentional device from the filmmakers. Evil Dead 2 is essential viewing for any fan of ghost stories.

1.0,evil_dead_2_dead_by_dawn,"Doesn't get old. ""I'm going to eat your soul!"""
1.0,evil_dead_2_dead_by_dawn,"How do you do such a gore fest in the style of the three stooges and make it work? I've not seen a movie succeed as horror and comedy, unless Sam Raimi has a hold on it."
1.0,evil_dead_2_dead_by_dawn,The new blu ray looks great. I watched the 90 minute documentary yesterday which rocked.
1.0,evil_dead_2_dead_by_dawn,"""That's right...who's laughing now?""-Ashley (Ash) J. Williams (Bruce Campbell)  Well I'd say Raimi is laughing, all the way to the bank."

1.0,evil_dead_2_dead_by_dawn,"Both Evil Dead movies are the prime example of pure horror fun, but for this one, I had to convince myself a couple of times that it's just a movie; It's that scary!"
1.0,evil_dead_2_dead_by_dawn,"It's more of the same, but Raimi puts the films bigger budget to great use. Their is more gore, more horror, more slapstick, and more insanity. Bruce Campbell is still awesome as ever playing Ash."
1.0,evil_dead_2_dead_by_dawn,I dont think this one is better then the first film. They are both equal in my eyes. Another great Bruce cambell and Sam Raimi team up.
1.0,evil_dead_2_dead_by_dawn,"My only problem is the beginning. I don't understand the need to recap the first film in this way. I don't believe 15 minutes is enough time to tell the story of the first film. It feels to rushed and condensed. Other than that, this film is perfect, outdoing its predecessor in every way."

1.0,evil_dead_2_dead_by_dawn,Evil Dead 2 is brilliant.
1.0,evil_dead_2_dead_by_dawn,"It's better than the first 1 because it has better special effects, more funny, excellent camera work and more!"
1.0,evil_dead_2_dead_by_dawn,horrible movie and fantastic i feel that it contains the same style of shotsin the first part but it is a little more exciting because there are chain saw and shotgun absolutely it is horrible and nice to watch the third part is connected with the second

Yet, after seeing Evil Dead 3 Army of Darkness, Evil Dead 2 pales in comparison."

1.0,train_to_busan,This is a 'tour de force' among zombie thrillers. The Walking Dead should take some notes.
1.0,train_to_busan,"Train to Busan, a korean movie to the next level and more..."
1.0,train_to_busan,This is definitely not your normal zombie movie. The zombies are just a backdrop to one of the most powerful things in the world - a Father's love and sacrifice.

1.0,train_to_busan,this is a really good movie
1.0,train_to_busan,Fun fast pace film that has some interesting visuals. It's a zombie film with a standard story but it manages to keep my interest. I'd recommend this to anyone that enjoys a comic book style zombie film. It's not over the top gore but enough to make an impact.

1.0,train_to_busan,One of the best zombie movies I have watched and I have watched a lot. I wish Filipinos could make a movie this good.
1.0,train_to_busan,Other than an awesome genre film it is one of the most beautifully written screenplays about fatherhood.

1.0,train_to_busan,What a fantastic Movie :D
1.0,train_to_busan,"This story tells you how gov control media suck. And it is interesting that Korean don't really make use of their phone to gain the upper hand on this fierce zombie... Yes, they simply run, blockade themselves, and fight back with bare fist.... (and a club)."
1.0,train_to_busan,I loved the cast. I loved the unpredictability of this movie. I loved every aspect.

1.0,train_to_busan,Western cinema with Asian drama
1.0,train_to_busan,"Train to Busan [Yeon, 2016] When everyone's becoming a monster, humanity is the way to survive. Fast-paced. Thrilling. Heartfelt. I honestly feel like Train to Busan lacks a stronger female character, but it's interestingly very human that I'm completely captured by it. 10/10"
1.0,train_to_busan,worth it !! hella great ! extremely great !
1.0,train_to_busan,"Wow!Can one be moved by a zombie movie? Yes, with Train to Busan. Deserving of Oscar nod as Foreign Pic"
1.0,train_to_busan,Train to Busan is definitely worth releasing beyond South Korea. The movie definitely has an international appeal to it. The all worn out zombie concept is made fresh when the story revolves mainly around that ill fated train to Busan.

1.0,russian_ark,Outstanding movie. Best watch with directors comments on.
1.0,russian_ark,"One of the most awe inspiring films I've ever watched. Intricate, ghostly and all over the place, it may be off putting but the experience is one of a kind."
1.0,russian_ark,"Even if a genius idea is not totally flawless, perfect correspondence between the form and the meaning."
1.0,russian_ark,"This movie, shot in one long continuous interrupted shot (no cuts, no edits, an ongoing take), is an unbelievable, hypnotizing, and extraordinary cinematic experience taking you through the building of St. Petersburg State Hermitage Museum."
1.0,russian_ark,one of the most fab films ever shot at the winter palace covering the 300 years of the Romonoff rule. It is a work of art that all should see
1.0,russian_ark,Exceptional masterpiece
1.0,russian_ark,"Ambitious and exquisite, RUSSIAN ARK is that rare film that reaches for the stars and succeeds. The final 8 minutes in which aristocratic party revelers leave the ball by slowly descending a staircase will be lodged in my cinematic memory forever. Nothing and everything happens in one long take."
1.0,russian_ark,"What a treasure of cinematography, directing, acting and history!"
1.0,russian_ark,"De esforço artístico impressionante e apuro técnico impecável, Arca Russa é um dos grandes filmes da história do Cinema."
1.0,russian_ark,Pretty unbelievable.
0.0,russian_ark,A technical feat but not a creative one.
1.0,russian_ark,"A fantastic technical achievement! Corrupting time continuum and using space to its most advantageous of artistic developments, Russian Ark is deep and patiently beautiful."
1.0,russian_ark,"I really like this movie, a few slow moments but it's somehow redeemed through a bit of light humour and the different insights of art and culture."
1.0,russian_ark,I was tired after watching this. But it is fantastic.
0.0,russian_ark,"If I wanted a tour guide of the Hermitage, I would rather be there in person. One big bore-fest! It's supposed to be a Drama but it feels like you're watching a documentary."
0.0,russian_ark,"I think I should have taken my one ""free to skip class"" day when we watched this. Instead I was intrigued by the idea of a film made entirely of one non edited shot. Too bad that camera with no editing never went anywhere of interest."
0.0,russian_ark,"An impressive feat (the entire movie is in one take), but without good characters or an interesting story I can't like the movie. I will give props though to the costume department because they are amazing. I might have liked it better if I knew more about Russian history."
1.0,russian_ark,This film is a magnificent stream of consciousness that showcases the treasures of the Hermitage Museum with dramatic snippets of Russian history.
1.0,russian_ark,"One shot, 2000 actors, 3 orchestras and 300 years of Russian History. This movie is one of the most unbelievable movies I've ever seen."
1.0,russian_ark,One of the best films I've ever seen. Almost Perfect.
1.0,russian_ark,"Now my seventh time seeing it. Each time is more meaningful than the last. Maybe someday, it'll replace my #1."
0.0,russian_ark,"Truly awful film. Don't waste your time. Dis-jointed, double subtitles and I like art and Russia. I thought I was in for a treat but was sadly not to be."
1.0,russian_ark,(Russia) A movie that was filmed in ONE TAKE; amazingly choreographed and presented to the big sreen. Not dull at all.
1.0,russian_ark,"One take, one shot - but Sokurov's experiment is so much more. An exploration of the Hermitage - Russia's Ark full of priceless art and exquisite history. A mesmerizing experience."
1.0,russian_ark,Absolutely Astounding. Incredible.
1.0,russian_ark,"very astonishing. this is a rare experience Sokurov has given,an exhilarating journey of Russian history through one single unedited 96 minutes.,my awe of this technical superiority exceeds it lacks of narrative,that could produces some sort of ultimate boredom.,damn brilliant !"
1.0,russian_ark,"great film, with fantastic dress worn and continuous panned shot!"
1.0,russian_ark,"emozionante. senza contare che sono stata all'hermitage, ricordavo ogni singola stanza. il gruppo di ragazzine che corrono, tra le quali Anastasia, mi hanno messo dentro una gran felicità. in più, la musica di Glinka <3"
1.0,russian_ark,Clever and innovative. In a word: perfect. Each room in this film is representative of a different period of Russian history as the camera travels throughout the Winter Palace in ONE 96 minute SHOT. This apparently took only 4 takes. Amazing.
0.0,russian_ark,I think I should have taken my one day free to skip class day when we watched this. Instead I was intrigued by the idea of a film made entirely of one non edited shot. Too bad that camera with no editing never went anywhere of interest.
1.0,russian_ark,The movie is great! The idea is deep!Not recommended for unprepared audience: thorough knowledge of Russian history and Russian philosophy needed for comprehension and real appreciation!
1.0,russian_ark,"Mind-blowing, one of the best films I have ever seen :)"
0.0,russian_ark,"I was initially intrigued by the premise (ooh! an entire movie in ONE SHOT!), but all it was was a 90-minute tour through a museum. There was no story, there was no excitement, and there was no interest at all. It put me to sleep countless times. You don't need to watch this. Ever."
1.0,russian_ark,"Una gran película, el Hermitage uno de mis grandes sueñosCon amor desde Rusia esta obra maestra!"
1.0,russian_ark,"A monumental museum. 300 years of Russian History in 90 minutes. 2000 actors. One single take, no cuts, no edition. Great music. Risky and ambitious as it is, in the hands of other director would had been a disaster. Great Sokurov!"
1.0,russian_ark,"That is what we call team works and the blessings of heaven... wonderful challenge of any film makers and just like the Hermitage itself, a piece of treasure to savour..."
1.0,russian_ark,Russian ark does for European art what Noah's Ark did for animals.... A profound allegory. The last scene is breathtaking. There never has been or will be a film quite like this. A magnificent nostalgic vision. It truly must be seen to be believed.
0.0,russian_ark,indescribably boring
1.0,russian_ark,"An unparalleled technical achievement. Total synergy between a director's creative vision and the abilities of a masterful D of P.Not only is this pure cinema of the highest order, it's also one of the most fascinating and beautiful 96 minutes you could hope to experience"

1.0,russian_ark,"A lesson in filmotography. Breathtaking and historic, this is an eye opener to the beauty of the Hermitage seen at key moments in Russia's history. Stunning."
1.0,russian_ark,Five stars just to show my respect .
1.0,russian_ark,One take amazing and very Slavic
0.0,russian_ark,This is the worst & most boring movie of all time. I'd give this NO STARS but I'm forced to give it a 1/2* just so my rating is tabulated.
1.0,russian_ark,"This film is absolutely incredible. I enjoyed it because Russian history is my expertise and one of my passions, but this type of film is not for everyone. Sokurov, in my opinion, opened up a new door of filming with Russian Ark. It is pure, visual genious... and all in one take!"
0.0,russian_ark,"You get an ""A"" for effort, but a ""D"" for being absurdly boring and fascinating probably only to serious students of russian history.I was bored to tears, just meandering around an art gallery while a guy babbles on and on."
1.0,russian_ark,I can't fully explain this film in one paragraph. A single 96 minute shot takes us on a guided tour through time in the corridors of the Hermitage in St Petersburg. One of the most original films I've ever watched.
1.0,russian_ark,"Wow. Just wow. Amazing film. I think that I would have understood more if I knew more about Russian history and culture, but aesthetically and cinematically, it was beautiful. The whole one take thing is astounding. Really."
1.0,russian_ark,"A masterpiece. This film is a bit snobby and ""arty,"" but you can't hold that against a film with moments of real emotional impact, cultural significance, and sheer technical brilliance."
1.0,russian_ark,"Although I suspected another ""technical gimmickry"" movie, this is simply magnificent."
1.0,russian_ark,"If you like your mind in 'idle' while your entertainment is spoon fed to you, this is not for you. But this is a visually, technically and poetically stunning piece of work."
0.0,russian_ark,"The concept of this movie is engenious. It is filmed all in a single shot and there are almost 800 actors. But all in all, it comes down to if this movie is actually interesting to watch. No, it's boring as hell!"
0.0,russian_ark,"Well this movie is different. Points for cinematography but all in all, dreadful absolutely dreadful. Hope I never see it again"
1.0,russian_ark,"Un film extraordinaire, compose d'un seul et unique plan-sequence de 96 minutes ! Toute l'histoire de la Russie defile ainsi sous nos yeux..."

1.0,russian_ark,"2000 actors and extras, 300 years of russian history, 35 rooms of the Hermitage Museum and 1 continuous 90 minute shot!"
1.0,russian_ark,"i admire the challenge Aleksandr Sokurov bought into the film. Also, it's very dreamy and very beautiful!"
1.0,russian_ark,"The fact that this movie was filmed with one camera, by one person in ONE take is amazing enough to give it a 5 star rating. It is a MUST see for anyone."
1.0,russian_ark,"Flows like a dream, amazing."
1.0,russian_ark,A single-shot spectacle through the Hermitage and through hundreds of years of Russian history. Worth watching if you're a film nerd (for the single-shot gimmick) or if you have any interest in Russia's weird relationship with Europe.
1.0,russian_ark,Mind Blowing. One of the Greatest films ever made.
1.0,russian_ark,Having only seen bits in a lecture - I've been dying to watch this film. And it didn't disapppoint. Not only is it awe-inspiring for it's absolute technical genius... It's indescribably beautiful.
1.0,russian_ark,"Like the Hermitage it takes place in, this film captures Russian art and history for others to enjoy and save for others. It feels like a dream captureing the music, clothes, art, and feeling of other times. Is it a dream, a history lesson, a journey through time? Russian Ark is truly a work of art."
1.0,russian_ark,"I hate history....it's boring, dull, and all in the past.  Somehow I was engrossed in this. Maybe it was the Russian accents...?  Original camera work too, which is always a bonus."
1.0,russian_ark,"FANTASTIC! It's a concept movie, but with a very concrete script. I especially love the ending."
1.0,russian_ark,"That was totally incredible (e.g. compelling, etc.)."
0.0,russian_ark,Still trying to get it :( But with all these good reviews I got to watch it again :S
1.0,russian_ark,"My favorite film of the 2000s so far. Hypnotic, terrifying, elegant, funny and ultimately very sad as we see, in the final shots, culture and society unmoored from history and afloat in the cosmos. Or something like that."
0.0,russian_ark,"Please don't... Yes, all in one take, amazing choreography of sound, movement, conversation... blah3. Instead take 3 days and wander through the Hermitage yourself. The sense of history and place is enough for you to make the movie in your own head. And bring a copy of Natasha's Dance."
1.0,russian_ark,Filmed in one shot at the Hermitage. Fucking brilliant.
0.0,russian_ark,"If I wasn't forced to watch this in class I would have smashed this to pieces. That old man was sooo *&%$# annoying and creepy!! The only cool thing was that it was all in one shot. That would be hard, but it would have been nice if that one long shot were INTERESTING!"
1.0,russian_ark,Beyond amazing... The experience is profound.
1.0,russian_ark,It is incomprehensible that the last scene could have been made without the camera stopping once.
0.0,russian_ark,"This would receive 4 stars if I knew anything about the history of Russia (which I clearly don't). Brilliant filming, though."
1.0,russian_ark,"The entire film is one continuous shot, unbelievable when you imagine the logistics of such a feat. The end result is a visual masterpiece that takes you on a journey through Russian history."
0.0,russian_ark,Sounded really spectacular on the synopsis but I couldn't even get through the first 30 minutes.
1.0,russian_ark,This movie was so beautiful! It inspired me to go to St Petersburg and walk through the corridors of the Hermitage aswell..
1.0,russian_ark,"Absolutely hypnotic to watch because what unfolds before your eyes is almost impossible to fathom. This film, which gives a fantastic tour of the Hermitage in St. Petersburg, is on the shortlist of films that are impossible to forget."
1.0,russian_ark,An amazing and epic film that is both a visual and technological masterpiece! Very good direction and amazing costumes.

1.0,russian_ark,"For anyone who loves going to museums, has a curiosity of Russian way of life, and can read sub-titles (which for some reason is difficult  for certain people). First seen in Chicago and have not stopped loving it since!"
1.0,russian_ark,wow one continuos camer shot over 2+ hours. NO EDITING AT ALL! and a cast of hundreds. Hard to follow the russian history but does that matter.
1.0,russian_ark,Utterly captivating in every since of the word! An entire film told in a single shot; a feat that I once thought impossible. The ending is brilliant!

1.0,russian_ark,"All that cast, all the computing power. Marvellous. Worth investigating the characters if you don't know who they are already."
1.0,russian_ark,"A fantastic, very interesting film!!It was the first feature film ever to be shot in a single take, filmed using a single 90-minute Steadicam tracking shot."
1.0,russian_ark,"fantastic, though you need to know your russian history to know whats going on or else you'll be totally lost and not enjoy the film, because its not a hollywood film of ""lets force feed the audience"""

1.0,russian_ark,Cinematography for the academic.

1.0,russian_ark,"I love this movie because it is an accomplishment. The entire thing was shot in one take, and it flows like a dream.

1.0,russian_ark,history at its finest
1.0,russian_ark,"Pure magic... You will be gently guided through lavish history and individual stories of extraordinary characters.

0.0,russian_ark,"This is the worst film I have seen in a long time. Yes it is all one long tracking shot but a conceit doesn't make a good story nor a good film on its own. This is dull, dull, dull."
1.0,russian_ark,"Shot in the Hermitage in a technical tour-de-force, it is a surreal evocation of Russian history."
1.0,russian_ark,"This is among my favorite movies. Death, immortality, history, beauty and cinema. It explains a lot."
1.0,russian_ark,The epic history of Russia choreographed into one single shot sweeping through St. Petersburg's Winter Palace. Fuckin' hell...
1.0,russian_ark,"Subtle, purposeful, like the movement of history itself. Absolutely nothing lost in translation. So close to Rembrandts, you can smell the turpentine."
1.0,russian_ark,"A film that is a meditation on a great and scarred country's history, cerebral and engaging and of course breathtakingly filmed in a way that makes you think ""how did they do that?"". Highly recommended."
1.0,russian_ark,"Thanks to the director Alexander Sokurov, cinema will now be unable to do anything more to top this..it'll be a great downhill sail from here..."

0.0,russian_ark,I must say the movie was a piece of art (1 long-shot for 90 mins!). But as every masterpiece- boring..
1.0,russian_ark,87 minutes of a SINGLE long take. I was amazed.
1.0,russian_ark,"Shot in a single take, absolutely brilliant. If you love russian art and history then you'll love it. if you don't you will be cutting your wrists by the end of this movie."

1.0,russian_ark,cinematic feat. innovative?...or maybe just original.
1.0,russian_ark,"Yeah, I kind of wanted the European to get together with the narrator in the end, so that was kinda disappointing. It was sad that he never caught up to Catherine the Great, too. Not a very satisfying story. Also, I don't get why the guys didn't speak English."
1.0,russian_ark,"Again -- superlative movie that most people won't watch. You don't have to know anything about St. Petersburg or the Hermitage Museum, but you'll probably want to look stuff up afterwards. Unbelievable cinematography."
1.0,russian_ark,This is stern Russian cinematographic perfectionism! My salute to Mr. Sokurov and his team.

0.0,russian_ark,Absolutely the worst movie I've seen. Watching it was as fun as getting drowned in a tub of soapy water. Skip this 1.
1.0,russian_ark,"Like any Russian musical composition, this film is hauntingly beautiful, and melancholic even in the height of its euphoria. It makes me wish I knew the history of St. Petersburg much better to get the visual references. Lovely and innovative - how often does that happen?"
1.0,russian_ark,"Not a film to see if you're looking for an easily digested story (a story there is, yes, but it is the story of Russian History and you have to piece it together yourself). But for those of you who are looking for an exquisite and beautiful dream put on film, this is the movie for you."
1.0,russian_ark,"one shot?! ONE SHOT! Apart from that, the stories that make up the film are amazing, brought even more to life through the single shot technique"
1.0,russian_ark,"A fantastic achievement in cinematography. A single shot sounds interesting, then when you see some of the truly big set pieces and just get blown away by the level choreography and orchestration of it all. Just watch it for experience."

1.0,russian_ark,This is an incredible accomplishment in film. One continuous shot. See this movie.
1.0,russian_ark,"Tremenda película, fue grabada en una sola toma, las escenografías son increibles."
1.0,russian_ark,"For connaisseurs of Russian art, culture and history, the film tends to be a little overbearing and lacking subtlety at times. However, the film is a technical tour de force, and at times adds subtle touches that beautifully illustrate what to Westerners is the paradox of the Russian soul."
1.0,russian_ark,"Wow, absolutely amazing in every sense. It is not only technically astounding, it's shear magnitude is the most awe-inspiring thing I have seen in cinema in years. It was like a perfect ballet in which hundreds of people are choreographed and perform perfectly. It is absolutely masterful."
1.0,russian_ark,"Like walking through a dream, Sokurov's Russian Ark takes on the seemingly impossible task of literally traveling through layers of Russian national history. A technically amazing and beautiful film."
1.0,russian_ark,"Having grown up going to the Hermitage a lot and actually remembering those rooms through the years, it brings a whole new sense of awe of this part of Russian history. The 90-minute fluid filming most amazingly captures the feeling of the palace."
1.0,russian_ark,Pretty amazing stuff...
1.0,russian_ark,This is one of the most interesting movies I've ever seen. You have to be patient and sit through some slow parts but the visual feel of the film is worth it.
1.0,russian_ark,"In my opinion, it's more like a play than a movie..with the Hermitage as the stage. Just the technical feat, along with covering such a wide span of Russian culture make this a remarkable movie."
1.0,russian_ark,"This film is astonishing. It is a historical adventure, an emotional revue of the past, told fluidly and compellingly with a single, perfect camera-shot."
1.0,russian_ark,"The final scene - well, perhaps ""sequence"" is more appropraite as the whole movie is filmed in one go - in the ballroom is just amazing..."
1.0,russian_ark,Epic tour of an epic museum.
0.0,russian_ark,If I EVER catch this pervert sniffing all these paintings and reciting poetry in one of MY museums I will be sure to wrap my hands around his throat until his eyes pop out of his head. I don't care if it was all shot in one take; I hate movies anyways.

1.0,reanimator,"Part gorefest, part sci-fi, and part cheesy throwback to Universal monster movies, Re-Animator is definitely a modern classic. Quirky and fun!"
1.0,reanimator,What do I have to say? It's fucking Re-Animator!!!
1.0,reanimator,"Love this one! although it strays from the Lovecraft story quite a bit, the gore and humor was great! plus it has the infamous-""head giving head"" twisted? yeh! Combs is great as Herbert West."

1.0,reanimator,"Another cheesy 80's classic, it's right up there with the Evil Dead series."
1.0,reanimator,"My favorite horror-comedy alongside Shaun of the Dead. Stuart Gordon takes Lovecraft's story, executes it perfectly while adding fine doses of humor that come from Jeffrey Combs' ridiculously creepy performance. Richard Band's score, despite the obvious Psycho influence, is amazing."
1.0,reanimator,Herbert West is my role model!

1.0,1015052-night_of_the_living_dead,"Before 28 Days Later, before the Walking Dead, before every other zombie movie, there was this tiny monster of a movie called Night of the Living Dead that started it all.

1.0,1015052-night_of_the_living_dead,"Even almost 50 years after its release, it still creates more tension than many modern movies (perhaps, also thanks to the dramatic black and white) that endlessy imitate scenes and moments of this picture. Bonus points for using a black actor in a lead role in 1968."
1.0,1015052-night_of_the_living_dead,"Night of the Living Dead is cruel and unforgiving in its horror, presenting stark, gruesome decay both physical and moral shocking for its political poignancy and influential in its aesthetic. It's a blunt powerhouse."

1.0,1109257-others,"Amenabar created an atmosphere in this film that is almost impossible to not believe. It's so hard in cinema to create a world that's so engrossing, but ""The Others"" does. The acting, photography, lighting, and subtleness of sound and acting make this film a masterpiece."

1.0,1109257-others,Remember watching The Sixth Sense for the second time to catch missed hints and recognize the extensive use of red throughout the movie? The Others will present the same effect as the ending will leave you in awe. Simply deceiving but the answers are right in front of you.

1.0,freaks,"Love this movie! it's funny, witty, and really freaky. For being made in the 30s this movie was probably very tongue in cheek at the time."

1.0,freaks,One of the most greatest movies of all time
1.0,freaks,"Only a genius´work could play and take a chance with the thin line between disturbing and heart-warming. Still as shocking today as it was on its time, ""Freaks"" creates a whole genre of its own, making the crowds cry, laugh and feel painfully disturbed at the same time."

1.0,freaks,"We accept you, one of us! Gooble Gobble!"
1.0,freaks,"One of the best movies ever, original, and the actors did an excellent job, even knowing they were not professional, the director Tod Browning made this film a excellent masterpiece, perhaps shocking to some people, but you should imagine at the time it was made. .."
1.0,freaks,"Gobble, gobble one of us!"
1.0,freaks,"This is an amazing movie! It gives you an insight to the life of a circus side show, but also makes you think about what life was like when ""freaks"" were shunned by society and it makes you think about your own humanity."
1.0,freaks,To think they got away with a film like this back in the day.

0.0,freaks,if youre going to make a dialogue heavy film. make sure that the audience can make out more than 5 words of dialogue in the first 20 minutes
1.0,freaks,Tod Browning's long-banned masterpiece on the human condition that used real circus freaks. It will redefine your humanity. Beyond essential.
1.0,freaks,"Not PC at all by today's standards, but reminds you that people with deformities have feeling too and if you are going to mess with them you are going to pay dearly(just kidding). Fantastic film though."

1.0,freaks,"Great film about circus sideshow performers, it's more of a melodrama than a horror movie but it is interesting that the film even got made in 1932. Todd Browning does a really good job with the subject matter and the performers do an excellent job in front of the camera."
1.0,freaks,Greatest classic horror film ever
1.0,freaks,"Shocking, smart, and certainly unforgettable"
1.0,freaks,So fucking cool and creepy. A must for any horror fan.
1.0,freaks,"An amazing horror film, although the horror doesn't kick in until near the end but when it does kick in, it is very scary. The film only suffers from one thing, being ahead of its time."
1.0,freaks,"""Freaks"", el fenomeno de culto dirigido por Todd Browning (""Dracula"") en 1932 es todavia una pelicula extrana, hipnotica, repulsiva y aterradora que pone la piel de gallina. Hasta ahora, ninguna pelicula de Tim Burton ha logrado el grado de visceralidad gotica de ""Freaks"". Sigue intentandolo, Tim!"
1.0,freaks,"Masterpiece is an overused word but I think it can be applied to this film with a high degree of accuracy. An honest film that we wouldn't see the likes of today, if you get the chance, watch it."

1.0,freaks,i found it to be brilliantly creepy. disturbingly shocking even. it also has a very well told story. a sorta love/revenge film. with some amazing use of lighting. plus all the real-life freaks are actually really freaky. watch out for that final scene! good stuff:)

1.0,freaks,Ah a breath of fresh air. It's out of the ordinary and i loved it. It makes me want to make a circus :) Daisy Earles is just the cuttest thing i've ever seen with the hair and makeup she's a doll. I loved Leila Hyams too :) It was a nice watch and I'm glad I saw it :)
1.0,freaks,"It's unfortunate that a movie like this destroyed Tod Browning's career and revolted so many people. The truth is, it shows a truth to humanity and who we are as people that the world didn't want to face, and still doesn't in a lot of ways."
1.0,freaks,This is a truly bizarre horror movie from Todd Browning and released in 1932. One of my favorites!
1.0,freaks,Nothing else quite like it.
1.0,freaks,"Ã?timo filme! Vale a pena assistir! SÃ³ sei por que gente nÃ£o gosta filme clÃ¡ssico, nem cor preto e branco! Se nÃ£o gosta, pega outros filmes sem graÃ§a que nÃ£o sabe escolher!"
1.0,freaks,Funny. Horrific. Romantic. Sad. These are just a few of the things I can say about this terrific film from 1932. I absolutely loved it. It is a small reminder as to why we watch movies in the first place.
0.0,freaks,i was forced to watch this film in media! i didnt like it but then that could be because im not the biggest fan of black and white films but also the characters were really hard tounderstand and also it has a difficult to follow story line!
0.0,freaks,"Yay for a revenge plot. Not.. you get 10 minutes tops of revenge and the rest watching a movie that's supposed to be interesting based on the actors. Sorry, just because they have deformities does not mean it's interesting. Snore fest."

1.0,freaks,"If you've never seen this film, you have missed out. One-of-a-kind, original, touching, and macabre."
1.0,freaks,"Amazing film! Genuinely disturbing, yet it has a lot of heart. The feeling of community between the sideshow performers is palpable, and the end sequence is very visually disturbing. Great performances all around as well! The Special features on the DVD are very interesting and highly recommended!"
1.0,freaks,Insanely bizarre classic of heart wrenching genius.
1.0,freaks,"The film that see is amazing, the history and reality gives a good message"
1.0,freaks,Amazing....really impresive visually. IT
1.0,freaks,"The wedding banquet scene is the center attraction in this odd little film. Equal parts exploitation & sympathy, with some truly bizarre double entendres & indelible images of Eck under the circus wagons."
1.0,freaks,my favorite film of all time
1.0,freaks,"so ahead of its time. still quite shocking today for its subject matter, yet it involves you in the most natural way by immersing you so fully into the experience of ""freaks"" that by the end you feel that there us no difference between us and them."
1.0,freaks,"Probably the most amazing thing about ""Freaks"" is the fact that Tod Browning actually used real-life circus freaks. The film is joyous and its freakish. The film manages to make us feel comfortable around these circus before the actual horror occurs. a horror classic in its own right."
1.0,freaks,"One of the best movies I've ever watched. It's so completely beautiful, a natural beauty. I can only imagine the impact it had back then."

1.0,freaks,"An AMAZING film which needs to be viewed by all! Onmany levels this is amazing! Now I get two South Parkreferences (Gooble-Gobble!, One of Us!). Real freakscast in this decent story of love and deception withhe members of a traveling circus. Here, watch it!"
1.0,freaks,Probably one of my favourite films ever!Still genuinely disturbing despite it's age. My only criticism (if it can really be called one) is that the original ending was cut. Apparently people weren't too keen on castration. Who knew!
1.0,freaks,"What does it mean to be normal? That what the film asks. The freaks aren't whats scary about this film... its the ""normal"" people."
1.0,freaks,"Such a sad, and creepy tale... and everything is real."
1.0,freaks,"changed the rating, this movie was milesssss ahead of its time when it was released, and i love how every freaks being portrayed with admiration as, well human being, they're no different than others. And about the ending, both of them deserve it, cunning jerks !!!"
1.0,freaks,"This movie is great, but I still gotta wonder what that quadriplegic guy is going to do with the knife. The tacked-on Hollywood ending was pretty bad though. I usually stop watching just after the climax for this reason."
1.0,freaks,This was a really good movie. I had to watch it for a class and it is was really good. I'm glad i took the class.
1.0,freaks,"A wonderful document of a certain group of people, and a spellbinding, atmospheric thriller."

1.0,freaks,filmed in 1932 this movie is amazing and the best part is they used real freak show people no special effects go see it!
1.0,freaks,one of the more fantastic films i have ever seen. this film pushes the boundaries even today. it has a capturing and beautiful plot and no one can forget the chant of gooble gobble one of us one of us...
1.0,freaks,this movie is AWESOME. they use real circus freaks. 'nuff said.
1.0,freaks,Le chef-d'oeuvre des chefs-d'oeuvres sur le thème!
1.0,freaks,"Disturbing, touching, and seriously awesome. A classic. This is one of the great black and white films which hasn't been pushed far enough to the forefront to keep it's quality in the mass consciousness. I love this movie."
1.0,freaks,"This movie is GREAT. It isn't politically correct, but it is historically correct, and horrifying. A true horror film, where beautiful becomes ugly, and ugly becomes beautiful. The nightmares can go on for weeks."

1.0,freaks,Disturbing. Who is the real freak?
1.0,freaks,"So much better than Dracula and still as powerfull as it was in 1932, it's definitely a must see (with femme fatale Olga Baclanova, gulp!)... too bad the studios wanted a happy ending!"
1.0,freaks,"A must-see for any horror film buff. A timeless classic that can now never be re-done, thanks to this era of ""political correctness""....which is sort of a shame...even if only to provide work for folks who could use some extra income."
1.0,freaks,"I love this movie.  ""one of us, one of us!"""
1.0,freaks,Ahead of its time. dark as they come and a ballsy move on Brownings part to cast real authentic (freaks as the movie calls them). Then top it all off with a cruel story line and you have your self a hit. (nn)
1.0,freaks,Esto es otro clásico un reparto muy variopinto.Una peli donde la belleza solo es una mascara.Venganza!
1.0,freaks,"This movie is so cool. The atmosphere of the attack is surreal. And remember, there is no makeup in this one, it's all real."
1.0,freaks,One Of the best movies ever
1.0,freaks,"This film is so twisted that how could a lover of the bizarre like me possibly not adore it? It is horrifying and bold and you will be unable to get its hypnotic chant out of your head: ""Gooble gobble, one of us. One of us."""
1.0,freaks,An beautifully moving and well crafted 'horror' film. Browning's very liberal approach to the subject matter is absoultely couragous and deserves massive applause.
1.0,freaks,"One of my favorites, Freaks is an amazingly empathetic and showcases the sideshow well. The voice of Hans is gold. You really feel for the freaks as the beautiful people are the antagonists."
1.0,freaks,Fantastic and a must see.
1.0,freaks,"Wow, I didn't expect to see this on quick rate! This is easilly one of my favorite horror films ever made! I would say this is Tod Browning's masterpiece, even more so than 'Dracula'. They definitely would not make this film today! ""Gooble gobble, gooble gobble, one of us! one of us!"""
1.0,freaks,"Que tal el reparto de esta peli WOW!!!!! esto si que son freaks, una historia de desamor y veganza en uno de esos circos macabros de principios del siglo XX"
1.0,freaks,"One of my favorite Tod Browning films. Considered controversial (especially at the time of its release), for his use of actors with actual deformities."
1.0,freaks,"One of the best horror films of the golden era of cinema. It is actually quite touching, sweet, and heartfelt,a s well as being totally weird and bizarre."

1.0,freaks,=0DD youtube is my new movie theater for rare antiques. /o/
1.0,freaks,"A pre modern gem of a film. Banned in the U.S.A for a short while, Freaks covers some serious topics while maintaining this eery and disturbing feeling. The film is sorely overlooked as one of the all time greatest. In my opinion, Freaks is the finest horror film ever made, and maybe the creepiest."

1.0,freaks,"We accept her, one of us!"
1.0,freaks,"AWESOME! Though it killed Browning's career, thank God this film exists. A very intelligent horror film that is thankfully finally getting all the praise it deserved years ago, rather than getting banned. I still wear my Freaks t-shirt with pride. Gooba Gaba."

0.0,the-evil-dead,"I honestly do not understand how this movie has a 95%. It is a completely asinine and worthless mess of a gore-fest with extremely kitschy and genuinely stupid parts to it. Even ""Airplane!"" had better 'special effects' than this load of garbage. One of the worst movies I have ever seen."

1.0,the-evil-dead,"Classic, old school, perfect."
1.0,the-evil-dead,"Nothing compares to this cult-classic, the originality of it is outstanding. Although this is the most serious in the trilogy (Army of Darkness being the third), it still is hilarious as the amateur filmmakers learned what they were good at. This is the gold-standard in B-Movie movie-making."
1.0,the-evil-dead,want to see i like the way the grils did went they chance
0.0,the-evil-dead,Honestly don't understand the appeal at all. The characters are all irritating and I found myself more annoyed (both with them and the unbearable screeching of the zombie demon creatures) than scared.

1.0,the-evil-dead,"The best of this excellent franchise blends dark humor,gore and terror like no one else has ever done....it's a classic for a reason."

1.0,the-evil-dead,"The remake can go get screwed by Bruce Campbell's chainsaw hand. This is the horror flick to rule all horror flicks. Every cliché horror movie made should be hailing to the king, baby."
1.0,the-evil-dead,Good horror.movie better than.remake
1.0,the-evil-dead,Great watch who coudn't love cheesy 80s goodness not bad holds up well and better than the remake in my opion.
1.0,the-evil-dead,The classic horror film still has a lot of fun and terror left in it to maintain the mass audiences of today.
1.0,the-evil-dead,mostly I deplore remakes/reboots but this I loved and frankly love it better than the original. I saw Army of darkness first and saw evil dead after and did not like evil dead but when I saw this in the theater with friends I have to say I like what I saw.spectacular update.
1.0,the-evil-dead,This movie scared the shit out of me when I was six. I watch it every Halloween.

1.0,the-evil-dead,best raimi film ever.
1.0,the-evil-dead,"While I never saw the supposed humour in this, The Evil Dead it the epitomal evidence that a low budget, natural special effects and original premises prove to be the most terrifying, superior and kick-ass horror films."
1.0,the-evil-dead,"Undeniably, one the most unique horror films ever made. Sure, it's cheesy and not scary. But that doesn't mean it wasn't artistically made. Sam Raimi's delivers a new way of filming, while Bruce Campbell is being his slapstick best."
1.0,the-evil-dead,"I didn't think I would like this as much as I did. The build up that I got from my sister made me think it would be worse than it was. I loved it. For it's time I believe that it was quite the horror, nowadays it is still creepy but not as terrifying as I was told it was."

1.0,the-evil-dead,"Very enjoyable cult classic. Very good visually, although the acting is as you would expect for a group of kids fresh out of college. Very good overall."
1.0,the-evil-dead,"Much funnier & campy than the remake. Evil Dead 2 is the same exact movie remade with a higher budget, same Actors, Director etc. 2 is the BEST. Gross & hilarious, & scary too! What 1, then 2 right after or the next day. Enjoy these classics!"

1.0,the-evil-dead,One f the scariest movies ever
1.0,the-evil-dead,"The evil dead is a crazed, low budget spook that may be funny in its ""dark humor"" range but its originality, added with its low budget effects, and old timey, sounds, makes evil dead impressively a serious one-of-a-kind scare"
1.0,the-evil-dead,"Sam Raimi's first full-length film is a relentless, gore-filled, cheesy horror film that set the standard for relentless, gore-filled, cheesy horror films. The laughs and scares are constant and, despite the hammy acting, the movie is just tons of fun."
1.0,the-evil-dead,Horror and hilarity. Yes please!
1.0,the-evil-dead,One of my favourite movies Bruce Campbell is so good in this

1.0,the-evil-dead,Cult Classic... if your a horror fan and havent seen this film then your not a horror fan!
1.0,the-evil-dead,Disturbing and one of the true original horror movies. Is a bit campy but still genuinely unnerving.

1.0,the-evil-dead,"Sometimes I wanted to be scared but couldn't resist to laugh at the movie's cheesy acting and bad makeup. How they portrayed Ash in the beginning made me literally laugh it loud.

1.0,the-evil-dead,Give me all the CGI horror remakes in the world but the original Evil Dead is proof that low budget horror can stand the test of time and still entertain immensly!

1.0,the-evil-dead,"A superb cult classic! camp, guts and cheese included."
1.0,the-evil-dead,"Delightfully combining an over the top gore fest with supernatural creepy crawlies and a richly dark comic vibe, ""The Evil Dead"" not only proved Sam Raimi's finesse as a filmmaker but also sets it's foot in the ground as one of the most distinctly original and enjoyable horror romps of all time."
1.0,the-evil-dead,"legendary and iconic, the fact it was Sam Rami's first movie is nothing short of extraordinary. The effects and ""CGI"" are laughable by today's standards but takes nothing away from how really disturbing this movie really is and still stands the test of time"

0.0,dont_look_now,"I have been a horror movie fan for 32 years. Read from tons of critics how this is one of the most shocking horror movies of all time, and, well, it had a famous sex scene. The only thing shocking, besides seeing Sutherland nude, ugh, is how bad this movie really is."

1.0,dont_look_now,This is one of my favs! It's set in Venice and is very atmospheric. The ending scared the crap out of me but it's dated and can't compare to the horror of mordern movies but that's why I like it..it's more subtle and hazy; like looking into the subconcious.

1.0,dont_look_now,A masterful horror movie that is very disturbing and scary.. but only for the sophisticated viewers who are able to capture the chill in the unique atmosphere of an isolated Venice. Roeg's best work and it includes a hauntingly beautiful score by donaggio.

0.0,dont_look_now,"If I could give a lower rating, I would. The movie goes on forever without reaching a point... ever. The film ends with an unclimactic chase scene with a huge let down of a shocker. The only scary part about this movie is how often you see Donald Sutherland's seventies bush."
1.0,dont_look_now,Julie Christie is fabulous
1.0,dont_look_now,A wonderful movie about loss and the healing powers of love. Another main theme is how suddenly everything can change in a blink of an eye. The movie has a distinctive look and use of sound. Classifying it as horror doesn't do it justice.

1.0,dont_look_now,This is a very unsettling film. Roeg did an awesome job of adapting that very scary Daphne Du Maurier atmosphere to the screen. Let's face it...who didn't nearly piss themselves when 'the child' is revealed?
1.0,dont_look_now,Holy shit. Holy SHIT.

1.0,dont_look_now,"If you like your horror fast, visceral and in your face this is not for you.

1.0,shining,M-F-O9.5[Stanley Kubrick]
1.0,shining,"(95/100)You always fear, what you don't understand."
1.0,shining,A great horror movie that contains tons of scares and creepy moments. Jack Nicholson shines as the lead character.
1.0,shining,One of Jacks best works. The way the isolation gets to him and the evolution of his evil is amazing. Truly a scary and suspenseful experience
1.0,shining,"This movie is not just thrilling, it can have elements of being awkwardly funny."
1.0,shining,"Stanley Kubrick delivers possibly the greatest psychological horror film of all-time. Suspenseful, chilling, and undeniably sinister, The Shining delivers a truly unique and intelligent experience that still draws controversy and analysis today. It's a masterpiece.5/5 stars"
0.0,shining,"One of the most overrated movies of all-time. Not scary, some terrible acting performances, including the stars. I get it that it has Kubrick's art, and that part is interesting at best. A big yawn for this one."

1.0,shining,"As much as fans of the book may complain, the true genius of this rather loose adaptation is the commitment it makes to its mood and internal terror. Kubrick shows once again that expertise and risk-taking do pay off in a genre too often safely guarded behind clichés and conventions."

1.0,shining,Nicholson's devilish performance for the ages transforms this masterpiece from a simply stirring horror show to a marvelously wicked haunting which parlays a textbook application of suspense and negative space.
1.0,shining,"Watch the documentary ""Room 237"" or Jay Weidner's ""Kubrick's Odyssey"" before your next Shining rewatch. See it under the presumption that Kubrick ironically layered a subtext with the film that it's a story of faking the moon landing. Just another way to love it, even if you don't buy in."

1.0,shining,"Possibly the greatest horror movie ever made, because ""The Shining"" is so psychologically disturbing and unsettling, it breaks all the corny clichés of the novel (no offense to Stephen King), resulting in a diabolical time-warp that drags any remains of the real Jack Torrance into hell."

1.0,shining,"Hated by Stephen King himself, loved by critics and audiences worldwide, The Shining is a tale of insanity - and sometimes you just can't figure out what is literal or what is symbolic or what is imaginative. But it doesn't particularly matter, as Kubrick engages and enthrals us right to the climax."

1.0,1021112-texas_chainsaw_massacre,I was 15 on Halloween night all by myself when i first watched this. Don't know if that helped make the experience more memorable but this movie is burned into my brain. One of the few movies that got that really disturbing feel to it without going over the top and being ridiculous.

1.0,1021112-texas_chainsaw_massacre,The tension early in the film gives way to a relentless attack on the senses later on. Hooper conveys brilliantly the heat and despair of his vision of Texas in the seventies. A masterpiece and rightly regarded as one of the greatest horror films of all time.
1.0,1021112-texas_chainsaw_massacre,Is there anything worse than a giant maniac chasing you with a chainsaw?One of the best in intense moments ever. Solid Blu-ray presentation but don't expect popping colors and fine detail. It still retains its gritty Grindhouse look in HD.

1.0,paranormal_activity,"This film changed horror. It's thrilling, it's true art, it's simple and brilliant. In my opinion, it's better to view it as a stand alone tale as the rest of the franchise truly disappoints. Still one of my all-time favourite films."

0.0,drag_me_to_hell,"With the exception of the awesomeness of Evil Goat, Drag Me to Hell is a horrendously acted, completely unoriginal, poorly plodding piece of trash that is way too comedic at some points and way too dramatic at some other points, it's a terrible attempt at fan service and...it worked? I quit."

0.0,drag_me_to_hell,I am so annoyed with this ridiculous movie. AICN recommended it but I personally thought it was stupid and the lead was 100% unsympathetic after some of the things she does. Don't waste your money on this crap
0.0,drag_me_to_hell,Just got back from watching this movie and it was not very good. The people in the movie theather we where in made fun of it the whole time. The only good thing about this movie was justin long. I wish I had gone and watched star trek again instead of wasting my time on this movie.
1.0,drag_me_to_hell,"The only predictable thing in this movie is the final twist, but it doesn't make this horror masterpiece any less good. Superbly acted, smart and hilarious, Drag me to Hell is another success by Sam Raimi's twisted mind."

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,The Bride of Frankenstein has been deemed one of the greatest horror sequels as it improves a lot from the original from effects to character
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,A true Horror classic. Make a point to see it. Very scary.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Sad and frightening, Karloff's performance is unnerving in its deep longing for purpose and understanding in a world that hates him for simply existing."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Good Movie Good Classic
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,The greatest sequel of all time.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"This James Whale masterpiece just gets better with each viewing. Every facet of the movie, from script, direction, acting, score, cinematography, and production, is world class. Not to be missed."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,A monster and his beloved dead bride!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"One of those rare sequels that is actually worthy of its predecessor. Karloff returns as the monster, and Clive as Frankenstein. Karloff adds more personality to the Monster, while Clive reluctantly obliges his monster with a Bride. A fantastic, simple, yet original work of cinematic art."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"James Whale's Bride of Frankenstein is surely even more odd, over-the-top, visually exciting, and terrifying than its 1935 release, because we are more conscious of its undertones of macabre and violation."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"5/5 * Possible better than its predecessor, The Bride of Frankenstein advances upon its themes while being all the better frightening."

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Awesome in every way!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,The very best of the Universal Horror films.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"A wonderful, cinematic feat as beautiful in its visual presentation as it is in its touching tale of the human condition as represented by Dr. Frankenstein's repulsive monster, who has become more 'human' than in the first installment."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"With spectacular visuals, a great villain, and the monster being able to talk, Bride of Frankenstein is undeniably superior to the original."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Just one word CLASSIC
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the few sequels to really surpass the first film on all levels. James Whale's use of tracking shots and self parody are really ahead of its time which makes this film feel timeless in a sense.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,My third favorite film of all time. Everything about this movie is fantastic.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"This is the perfect example of a great film. The symbolism, Art Direction, acting, directing, and score is nothing short of pure perfection. This sequel is better than the original film. We really get to know the Monster better than ever."

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"It's great! Although, it's more about Frankenstein than his bride; and it ends rather strangely."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Although not a horror film, this movie is one of the best films from the 30s. Holds up EXCEPTIONALLY well."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,seen it & own it! =0)
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"This movie is amazing. It combines comedy, parody, horror, and drama together in the right combination. The era when the movie came out helps a lot too. Multiple/mix genre like this wouldn't fly today."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Shows how man is the true monster.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,It really IS as good as they say.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,A sequel that surpasses the original. Boris Karloff was a woefully underrated actor. He gave the Frankenstein Monster such a gravitas thatno other actor who has essayed the role has ever come close to matching.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"A definite great movie. The only problem is that you only see The Bride for 2 minutes, then the movie ends... What?"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Alone: Bad. Friend: Good!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,For me better than the first.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"I LOVE the opening. What a way to allow for a sequel when the first seemed over and done with. A little more of a comedy, a little more of a horror, lots more energy and style than the first film. And what an ending! ""WE BELONG DEAD!"""
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,The absolute best film of its era and genre.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Probably the first sequel to be clearly better than the first.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"My favorite classic horror movie by far. Enough has been said about this movie over the years that I can't add anything more. If you haven't seen this, and you love classic cinema, this is a must see."

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,your wife hates you get drunk with a blind guy!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,The monster smokes dope
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Its incredible how well James Whale's horror classic has aged. The greatest Frankenstein movie made is technically astonishing even to this day and Boris Karloff is both frightening and emotionally touching as Frankenstein's monster. Perhaps the greatest universal horror movies ever made.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,The best horror film ever made! Astonishing performances by Karloff and Clive! The reviving of the bride is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of horror films.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"This is a great sequel! I love that it, to me, has some comedic lines. Or maybe its just my brain because I LOVE Young Frankenstein? :)))"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,This movie does the impossible multiple times. It makes the monster into an endearing character. The movie makes you feel for the murdering mix of dead bodies. And most of all: it expands and exceeds the original. One of Universal's best!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,This was strangely magical and creepy with a heart hidden within itself.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"awsome, just awsomne!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"A true classic. Even better than the original. Ernst Thesiger practically steals the show with his flamboyant and macabre Dr. Pretorius. A must see, if not own, for any true horror fan."

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Alone, bad... Friend, good..."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the best Frankenstein movies ever.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"A Fantastic film. The Monster is more present in this film and is very enjoyable to watch. Boris will always be the best Frankenstein as far as I'm concerned. Elsa Lanchester is very Haunting and beautiful as the bride, yet her hissing is very eerie. If you love Horror movies this is a must see."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"I actually really liked it. The special effects were extremely impressive for 1936, Boris Karloff did an amazing job as The Monster, supporting actors and other roles were great actors,and the scene with the blind man for some reason really touched me. The whole friend idea I guess. I reccommend."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Really is one of the greatest movies of all time. Deserves to be among the ranks of Citizen Kane or Sunset Boulevard.

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"fantastic film - possibly better than original, shows more brutality than the original and more character development. A superb masterpiece of early cinema"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Another one of those rare sequels that outshine their predecessors. Also directed by James Whale 'The Bride of Frankenstein' manages to delve deeper into the characters from the original film. Again Karloff gives his all as the Creature who longs for acceptance.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"About as brilliant as a sequel can get. Great story, interesting characters, beautiful music, and the performances by the actors are amazing. Bride of Frankenstein is a true cinematic Masterpiece."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"This is definately my favorite of the sereis. Clive and Karloff bothe give great preformances and makes you feel for the characters, even the monster. dr. Pretoreous is one of the best villains on screen and possibley the best mad doctor portrayed in a motion picture. check it out cause its epic."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"The best of the Universal monster movies. Bride is that rare sequel that, after viewing, feels like an essential companion to the original, the other half to complete the story. It's also truer to the book (a little), and just incredibly satisfying all around."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"The Bride of Frankenstein is just as great as the original, but this time around, we feel for the monster."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Personal favorite. I love this movie. ""To a new world of gods and monsters!"""

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,I love this film so much!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Clive and Karloff continue to own their respective roles. This time Elsa Lanchester is along for the ride and adds something special. I'd actually argue that this is superior to the original Frankenstein.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"As classic as Whale's Frankenstien is, his sequel is even better. A true masterpiece and one of the crown jewels in the Universal classic monster series!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"just like its predecessor, classic"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Iâ(TM)d have to say all of the Universal Frankensteins held to a marvelously entertaining standard. Yes. Even âFrankenstein Meets Wolfman.â?  The humor James Whale injected into this one was quite a risk, but it came of beautifully, only increasing our sympathies for The Monster."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Yes. This is how you make a movie. Fantastic characters all around and insanely good lines.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Despite the fact that people will inevitably compare and contrast this with the original 1931 Frankstein, this is a different, pardon the pun, beast. Bride of Frankenstein is characterised by the camp and hammy performances of Ernst Thesiger and Una O'Connor and a sly, dark sense of humour."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Absolutely the best Frankenstein movie ever.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the very few sequels which improves on the first film. This is a blackly comic horror.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"This was the last of the great Universal horror films...after this, Universal took a downward trend into cheap camp, and the bright spots for the next 20 years were few and far in-between."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"More emotionally powerful than it has any right to be, ""Bride"" forever destroys the idea that a sequel is always inferior. Great emotion, iconic imagery, and even visual effects, are what make this widely considered one of the greatest thrillers ever put to film."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Director James Whale once again creates another great Frankenstein movie. As a sequel, the movie sticks a little more truthfully to the book and manages to give the monster a voice. A strange and at times funny film."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the best horror films ever made. A classic of the 1930s.

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"It takes everything that works in the first Frankenstein and improves it.

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Atmospheric, campy and just plain fun to watch. I love the whole 7 film Frankenstein series released by Universal in the 30's and 40's but this one is my favortite. This, the second in the series, was the last one directed by James Whale."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Some say this is better than the first one, it's definitely a close one. More science fiction is thrown in with the black magic dr. and his miniature people, it's kinda weird but that's the only part I have a problem with, everything else is great!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"One of the great horror films, is also a biting satire of love and acceptance. Lonely guy wants to meet a nice girl, he gets two doctors to create her and she rejects him. But that's how it goes in life. The ugly guy will always be rejected by the girl for the good looking doctor."

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"De toda una saga, de toda una epoca, la joya maxima de los estudios Universal."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"to the untrained eye this film simply reaffirms social norms and values, but it is subtly coded with subversive critiques of race, gender, and sexuality. i'm not saying the hollywood censorship codes were a good thing, but they certainly forced filmmakers to become much more clever."

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"An absolute classic! Really. To have created this film in 1931 is astounding. It's short and sharp, just like all those good, old films, and it's truly poignant at times. A must-see for lovers of b-grade horror and the like ;->"

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,It's still gt some nice impressionism happening and is a much more imagination filled Frank than the first one.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the all-time greatest sequals ever made.

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"The greatest gothic horror film of all time. The jewel in the crown of Universal's classic monster movies. Spooky, atmospheric, touching, you name it, it's in here. Only an actor like Boris Karloff could have made this monster sympathetic. A great, great film."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Brilliant. Dr. Frankenstein's trying to get out but Dr. Praetorious keeps dragging him back! btw, this is a tremendous step in the development of ""the sequel."" Whale and his cohorts were wise enough to grow the world, rather than remake the first picture..."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"LOVE THIS MOVIE! My all time monster hero, the bride. she is so pretty, but should she live or not for it will change the the matter if the monster specie will live..."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Worth seeing for Ernest Thesinger alone. Somehow I always link this to ""Night of the Hunter"" because it's like watching a nightmare but somehow enjoying it and wanting to revisit it."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,This film has amazing special effects for 1935! I loved Karloff as the sympathetic monster but Dr. Pretorius is the best mad scientist ever!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Brilliant! Better than its predecessor, and full of the perfect mixture of horror, humor, and heart. A must see classic masterpiece."
0.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"I've managed to forget everything about the movie, the only thing I remember is when the movie ended I said ""That's IT? What a waste of time!""Second time I tried watching it I fell asleep."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Yes, it is better than Frankenstein."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,A masterpiece that amazes even today.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"James Whale's masterpiece genre film. This film is remarkable, not only because of it's stunning black and white cinematography, but also for it's heart, whimsy and influence. This is the film that Tim Burton aspires to make. It won't happen."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Oh, I love this movie. It's perfect."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,A rare case where the sequel is better. One of three classic Frankenstein tales.

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Very rarely does a sequel supercede the life before it. This one does and in spades.  Oh, and Dr. Pretorius is a great character."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Elsa Lanchester is perfect as the bride. Her reaction to the monster, and his reaction to her, is tragic."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Un classique. Cette suite est encore mieux que le premier Ã©pisode (1931). Une somptueuse photo en noir et blanc, un monstre on ne peut plus convaincant et une histoire qui n'a pas pris une ride. Ã? voir."

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"THE classic horror movie. Not scary as such, but moving and enthralling."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,better than the original. The human portrayal of the monster is my favorite aspect of this movie.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Even better than the original. James Whale's sequel is a great, great movie. The Bride is amazing of course, even though you see her only briefly, and there's a lot more humor than the first movie. Amazing movie."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Sometimes I have wondered whether life wouldn't be more amusing if we were all devils, and no nonsense about angels and being good."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Even though The Bride has very little camera time I find myself enchanted by the last few minutes of this film anyway. The rest of it is alright but the 5 stars go to the last few powerful minutes that Elsa shines in*
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Probably one of the first and best SEQUELS of all time. Great film.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Better than the first in my opinion. Sad as hell.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the few occassions that a sequel is better than the original. I also like how Whale took elements from Shelley's original work and inocrporated it into this film.

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Way different than Frankenstein, almost a comedy but a very sad classic."

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,This is where it's at.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Sequel surpasses original; there are only two other instances of this (as the previous reviewer notes). Everything in this movie is exactly where and how it should be. I love me some Dr. Pretorious.

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"A great classic, not really spooky as funny, though"

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"This film is a prime example of a sequel that surpases the original. Loe all Universal horror, but this is by far the best!"

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Stunningly modern mix of humour and tragedy. Endlessly re-watchable from the arch prologue to the weird conclusion. James Whale knew a thing or two.

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Creepy and atmospheric, this movie is fantastically entertaining."

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"This flick walks the line, man. You're gettin chills one minute(if you let it, it is creepy), and laughing the next."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Much better than its predecessor. The movie has a more personal touch and is more stylized. Overall, it's a much better experience than the first Frankenstein."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Very odd. But at the same time very good. Universal never had a flop with horror films in the 30's.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Classic Universal Horror. This one is the best of the three Karloff films, which is saying a lot. There'e a bit of whimsey here, but it's dark, brooding and fun. The Bride is devastating and the monster SPEAKS!"

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"One of the best sequels ever made, no matter what movie series you consider."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"I saw one scene: the final one. I take its memory out and fondle it every half moon. Knocked me on my ass. Beautiful. Walesevolved expressionism into the horror genre. I am a pedant, a monster far worse than Boris Karloff any day."

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the best movies ever made.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,One of the few sequels ever to surpass it's original in everyway!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Arguably better than the original Frankenstein, The Mummy and Dracula, James Whale's second Frankenstein picture is a masterpiece of gothic horror. As re-animated babes go, Elsa Lanchester's ""Bride"" is hot as blazes. Too bad she didn't feel the same about Karloff's ""Monster"". A perfect film."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Tops the original in every way and may be the best damn horror film of all time. There's just so much entertainment value here, it's incredible."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,A brilliant sequel that doesn't take itself too seriously. Tim Burton owes a lot to this movie.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"The greatest of all of the Frankenstein films, and the greatest of all the Universal Monsters Collection! James Whale ?s direction is superb and is far ahead of any other film around that time, and Boris Karloff gives the performance of his life. Masterpiece!"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Better than the first.
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"One of, if not, THE best horror movie ever. One of the first to use humor in the story as well, if only they had kept the additional poltlines in, but this is where the monster really shines"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Just one of these movies you´ll see over and over again, laughing every time"
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Nothing like seeing Elsa Lanchester in full dress as the bride!
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"Better than the original Frankenstein (which is hard to top) ""Bride of Frankenstein"" is... chances are, the best film to come out of the Universal Monster Era (alongside the original)"

1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,"The greatest sequel, better than the original Frankenstein, even better than the book."
1.0,bride_of_frankenstein,Probably the best of the classic Universal Horror films.
1.0,gojira,"It never falters, delivers on all of it's promises, and has an entertaining and very mind-absorbing plot, which bears more meaning than most of us can possibly even imagine. But in the end, one thing's for sure, and that is that this is Godzilla, and he has never. . . ever. . . been better."
1.0,gojira,"holds up very well. top 10 movie. analogy of nuclear war. haunting with a guy in a rubber suit, how do you pull that off with such a great visual ad aural movie?!"

1.0,gojira,I LOVE GOJIRA!!!!!!!

1.0,gojira,"A cinematic masterpiece, historical movie treasure. This film is awesome. Special effects are tremendous. The use of miniature models is superb. Night scenes with Godzilla photographed flawlessly. Social message is strong and clear given the dark times of the postwar world and a fear of nuclear war."
1.0,gojira,I was delightfully surprised by the human elements in this movie. It's one of the rarest horror movies to make me sympathize sincerely for humanity.
1.0,gojira,100/A+. One of the best postwar commentary and anti nuclear films. Yes it's the same movie with a guy in a giant lizard costume destroy miniature sections of Tokyo and toy military vehicles.
1.0,gojira,The original Godzilla film is a masterpiece of Japanese cinema!
1.0,gojira,"The most iconic movie from Japan, Godzilla or Gojira is a impact of cinema with it's classic technology of a man in a rubber suit. So satisfying to see destruction at it's best!"

1.0,gojira,One of the greatest monster movies of all timeGreat acting that makes feel for the character Great effects (for its time)Great cinematography And great soundtrack that will last forever
1.0,gojira,The original masterpiece Gojira. It's potent and has impact and is a classic for a reason.
1.0,gojira,"Devastating, enthralling, and actually quite frightening; Gojira is a biting piece of post-war commentary and as timeless as it is politically astute."
1.0,gojira,Man in rubber suit tramples on matchstick models of Tokyo as denizens look up in terror. The original Godzilla is all that and more. The original Godzilla is far different from the tag team slogfests that followed. Much imitated (I'm talking about you Jurassic Park) but rarely bettered.
1.0,gojira,"Even after all these years, it's still a great movie."
1.0,gojira,"Gojira(Godzilla) is a film of great suspense, brilliant storytelling, amazing effects(for time) and spectacular characters. These factors and more make this my personal pick for the greatest movie of all time."
1.0,gojira,"While the special effects are dated, it still holds up to this day as the best monster movie of all time, offering emotionally gripping human drama that provides a chilling realistic atmosphere. It all builds up to an epic third act that will forever leave us questioning our ethics and morals."

1.0,gojira,Perfection! Awesome atomic warfare allegory!!! Brilliant!!! So thought-provoking!!!
1.0,gojira,A master peice by every definition of the word. It truly brings to life the horrors of nuclear war and is much more serious and gritty in tone than the more campy sequels of the 60's and 70's. Looking forward to the new one coming may 2014!
1.0,gojira,This movie is Beautiful. A masterpiece. More than a monster movie

1.0,gojira,Beautiful! Rich! Moving! Gojira!
1.0,gojira,"More than just a monster movie, a great social commentary. For those who think the idea of a man in a rubber suit is stupid, it looks far more realistic than CGI! What a classic movie, I enjoy it more every time I watch it."
1.0,gojira,"One of the most incredible movies of all time. No, really. It's far beyond the cheesy 60's Godzilla and totally takes it seriously. As well, its far better than even the U.S. Raymond Burr version. As good, if not better, than the classic King Kong, and deserving of much more appreciation."
1.0,gojira,"Groundbreaking monster film, that tells of the dangers of nuclear bombs. Deals with serious issues via a form of entertainment. Great classic film."

1.0,gojira,This is a great monster movie that goes beyond the typical campy stuff and actually tells very dark tale with a powerful message about war and its affect on humanity.
1.0,gojira,men in rubber monster suits... this is what classic movie making is ALL about
1.0,gojira,This film got me into Godzilla. Plain and Simple.
1.0,gojira,Classic monster movie. It has never grown old for me.
1.0,gojira,"This is my FAVORITE Godzilla movie, I like it more than final wars. Why? Because it starts the legend of Gojira (Godzilla)"
1.0,gojira,"Absolutely astounding. No other film in the series (with the exception of Return of Godzilla) captures the power and horror of the beast. He is the bomb, and while watching his destruction of Japan, you start to believe it"
1.0,gojira,"If you've only seen the American re-edit, then you haven't seen Godzilla. This one packs an emotional whallop!"
1.0,gojira,As much as I love the Burr version (and I do) the original Japanese version of Gojira (Godzilla) is an absolute masterpiece. It truly captures the horrors that Japan suffered in the aftermath of the atomic bomb.
1.0,gojira,"Godzilla is the man, The beginning of a 50 year monster icon."
1.0,gojira,This is a MASTERPIECE
1.0,gojira,"The original Japanese masterpiece, as it was meant to be seen. Yeah, the American version is a nice 50's monster movie, but this version transcends beyond that, and it's message can be heard for modern audiences at last."
1.0,gojira,"Gojira aka Godzilla (1954) is THE greatest monster movie ever made, and if you can get passed the 50 year old low budget effects you'll see the way Godzilla was meant to be seen"
1.0,gojira,The Japanese version is better than the American (Raymond Burr) version.
1.0,gojira,"A Frankenstein fable for the atomic age, supported by brilliant acting (yes! in a Godzilla movie) and ingenious lighting make this Kaiju classic no laughing matter."
1.0,gojira,"Very dark, and sometimes scary, especially layered shots of Godzilla and the people running at his feet. Very moving, and heavy. Akira Ifikube's score is incredible, and makes the film work. An excellent cast, and compelling story make this a deep impact in cinematic history."
1.0,gojira,"After so many years and so many viewings this film hasn't lost a bit of power or effect. It stands above the rest not because it was the first in the Godzilla series, but because it experiments heavily with a narrative style that resembles what we call cutting edge today."
1.0,gojira,"I'm serious, Godzilla has balls. Other movies go great with Megadeth!"
1.0,gojira,Easily the best monster film ever.
1.0,gojira,The most powerful most moving most purposeful Godzilla movie and the first of them all
1.0,gojira,Amazing in every way
1.0,gojira,A masterpiece of film making
1.0,gojira,The King...the Legend...the greatest monster movie ever made!
1.0,gojira,"if a 400 tall fire breathing political activist monster isn't badass, i don't know what is."
1.0,gojira,The original! Watch the Japanese version to understand the movie better.
1.0,gojira,"THE monster movie of the 20th Century - though also much more. As dark and disturbing a nuclear allegory today as it was in 1954, GOJIRA is, quite simply, a masterpiece."
1.0,gojira,"This movie is a masterpiece. It is more than just a monster running loose film, it is a terrifing reminder of the horrors of nuclear weapons and testing. Seeing a mother huddled in rumble with her two children, telling them they will all be with daddy soon, is heart wrenching in a horrifing manner."
1.0,gojira,Fantastic. Puts a smile on my face every time.
1.0,gojira,"The original Godzilla was a horror movie with no pretense of good and evil, simply the mind-numbing destruction of a man-made force."
1.0,gojira,The one that started it all - deep amazing and moving - this is not just a guy in suit this is a real film a cry against the arms race and the maddness of war. (not that guy in the suit films are bad).
1.0,gojira,The Classic! You Must See!!!
1.0,gojira,One of the best monster movies ever - especially the uncut Japanese original.
1.0,gojira,Nuclear weapons are bad. Movies with big giant fire breathing monsters on a rampage are awesome.  I really want to watch the rest of the Godzilla movies now.
1.0,gojira,This is the original Japanese edit without all the American crap with Raymond Burr sliced in. It's so much better!!
1.0,gojira,This is the best monster movie ever made. It is simply amazing.
1.0,gojira,"The absolute pinnacle of monster movies. This is the measure by which all others are weighed, measured, and found wanting."
1.0,gojira,I love all the TOYO Godzilla films ... but here it started. Even better is the real original version sans Raymond Burr
1.0,gojira,"The first one, and definitely one of the greatest. The original Japanese version, this one, is FAR superior to the Americanization with Raymond Burr. Scarier, too."
1.0,gojira,"Just... too... awesome. This is the kind of monster movie I grew up with, in fact it's the king of them all. It also has a great meaning behind it."
1.0,gojira,This is the one that started it all. The original Japanese cut that is more powerful than the American cut. A classic to change people's view on giant monster movies.
1.0,gojira,"This movie is the original Godzilla, and it's bad ass for being from the 50's. FUCK CLOVERFIELD!"
1.0,gojira,best science fiction film made in japan and the best of the series of godzilla
1.0,gojira,Just terrifying. Still the best monster on film.
1.0,gojira,Top notch sound effects and costumes! A++
1.0,gojira,The Japanese version is better than the American if you don't mind subtitle.
1.0,gojira,"After growing up with the silly American re-working of this film and eventually discovering the original on a low-quality bootleg copy of a copy, it's wonderful to finally have a proper version of this film in my collection."
1.0,gojira,"Sad, unflinching and potent."
1.0,gojira,The first and Still the best.
1.0,gojira,"the ultimate classic that spawned more than 20 sequels and made monster movies what they are today. every monster after this was modeled after godzilla, but you gotta love the big ol lizard. if your a fan of him, you have to have seen this movie. its where it all started."
1.0,gojira,One of my favorite films of all time
1.0,gojira,This is the original un-cut Japanese version which is much longer and more in-depth than the heavily cut American Version.
1.0,gojira,"One of the greatest movies ever made, finally released in America in it's unsanitized version. Even my father, who self identifies as a right wing Republican, loved it when we sat down and watched it together. Watch it with a friend, you'll have something to talk about at the end."
1.0,gojira,The greatest move ever filmed. The true king of all movies.
1.0,gojira,"It's a masterpiece, I am proud of tha t this film affected famous directors after all. It's classic but still better than the remake in Hollywood"
1.0,gojira,Definitely a masterpiece. Groundbreaking filming techniques make this movie a must see for any science fiction fan.
1.0,gojira,great. i didn't think the first godzilla movie would be smart
1.0,gojira,Much more grittier and gripping than the dubbed American version with Raymond Burr. Japanese movies also sound more serious in the original Japanese.
1.0,gojira,"Back when Godzilla movies were serious. Basically, an allegory for the A-Bomb. Also, the greatest giant monster movie of all time."
1.0,gojira,"The original Godzilla, and the only good one. More a social commentary then a monster flick, this movie is compelling and beautifully filmed. One of my favorited movies since I was about 3."
1.0,gojira,"Way betterthan the Americanized bastardization of it. The metaphor was straightforward, yet moving nonetheless."
1.0,gojira,It is an all time classic plus the start really of all the big monster movies. Plus it is one of the better Godzilla films too.
1.0,gojira,A seriously great monster movie.
1.0,gojira,Accept no substitutes.
1.0,gojira,Accept no substitutes.
1.0,gojira,"Do not watch the American cut, accept only the original source of all our terrors, the one and the original. Everyone who made this movie would have PERSONAL connections to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and THIS is their story, a film which has no peers."
1.0,gojira,Haunting and Original! This flick is more than just a monster movie. It packs a real message about the dangers of nuclear weaponry and will no doubt leave you in tears.
1.0,gojira,A short review..if you have never seen a Godzilla movie.THis is the one you should see
1.0,gojira,"Say what you want about the sequels, but don't make fun of this one. It actually succeeds at being serious and bleak."
1.0,gojira,THE greatest monster movie ever made. And that is not an opinion.
1.0,gojira,Pure classic. If only there were more movies like this.
1.0,gojira,Total Classic...I tend to not like monster movies but this is like few others. A lot of politcal comentary in this one.
1.0,gojira,"The classic, the one that started it all and really deserving of classic status, but only the Japanese version not the inferior American version."
1.0,gojira,"For being 1954, spectacular effects, also makes you think about the effect of nuclear weapons. The line from the song godzilla comes to mind. ""History shows again and again how nature points to the falling of man."""
1.0,gojira,"screw Jaws and The Host, this is the best monster-on-the-loose flick ever made, AND a poignant statement about the horrors of war. if you can see the original Japanese version you'll never look at men in suits the same way again."
1.0,gojira,"The Rolls Royce of monster movies, ""Gojira"" is simply a legendary classic."
1.0,gojira,"Possibly the most brilliant and deep monster movie ever, ever. If you've only seen the american version, this is a totally different film."
1.0,gojira,"The original 1954 version is much more in depth than many would be lead to believe, and Akira Ifukube's score is stellar. The American version while butchered is still pretty good."
1.0,gojira,see the original version from japan. It is awesome.
1.0,gojira,"Both versions are great. I think comparison between the two is unnecessary, now that they are sold together. The original is great, Burr is great too. He really knew how to ""serious"" it up! Godzilla used to be scary; but was always fun!!"
1.0,gojira,a landmark in cinema history. incredible movie. one of the best movies ever made.
1.0,gojira,the original is always the best
1.0,gojira,"The 1954 Japanese version is a masterpiece with an obvious allegory and symbolism to WWII and the atomic bombings in Japan. Oh, and the U.S. version is still pretty fun."
1.0,gojira,"The original 1954 masterpiece, and it's FAR different from it's many sequels and imitators. Brilliantly done, and the symbolism is powerful."
1.0,gojira,"""Just go and watch it dammit!!!"""
1.0,gojira,More than a mere monster movie with a guy in a rubber suit smashing cardboard buildings and model tanks and planes. An artful and somber allegory to WWII and the atomic bomb. See this before the American version. It's better.
1.0,gojira,If you don't like this...you aren't a real person. Gojira forever.
1.0,gojira,The Original -and The Best.
1.0,gojira,"Although the effects are dated, the movie remains a compelling allegory for nuclear warfare. While it's not the goofiest, it's the best ""Godzilla"" film. Akira Ifukube supplies a pulse-pounding score."
1.0,gojira,"The one that started it all. If you are a serious Big G fan, you'll watch both. If not, avoid the campiness and watch the original Japanese version. It's more enjoyable."
1.0,gojira,The one that started it all. Japan's allegorical piece about nuclear weapons which would be the foundation of an unlikely long lived franchise.
1.0,gojira,Very underrated. Actually has some very moving scenes and a real message and point. Essential to see the original Japanese version.
1.0,gojira,"A man in a rubber-suit, do I need to say more?"
1.0,gojira,"The beginning of the greatest series of films, ever."
1.0,gojira,Best monster movie. Ever.
1.0,gojira,most people see a giant rubber suit . . . those people are fucking retarded
1.0,gojira,basically the best giant monster film on earth
1.0,gojira,The ultimate giant monster movie. The American version (Godzilla: King of the Monsters) is passable but misses the point.
1.0,gojira,Japanese version all the way! How it was meant to be seen.
1.0,gojira,Godzilla rocks!!!!!!!!! I have loved this movie since I was a little kid!
1.0,gojira,One of the best Japanese films ever made. This is the one that started it all.
1.0,gojira,"The greatest movie ever made. I've seen it over 3,000 times!!!!"
1.0,gojira,Hauntingly beautiful anti-nuclear movie.
1.0,gojira,"Not only a great monster movie, Gojira is a powerful allegory for the atomic age from the one nation that knows the true horror of atomic power."
1.0,gojira,Its Godzilla whats not to like
1.0,gojira,"Godzilla's darkest and perhaps crowning hour, one that represents the monster as not only a city destroying fiend but a threat to man's very extistence. As many other reviews have said the undercurrents of this movie are very deep and potentially very disturbing as well."
1.0,gojira,"Even better in the original Japanese version- Find out how they REALLY feel about us and our ""devices"""
1.0,gojira,"The ORIGINAL!!! No Raymond Burr, etc.."
1.0,gojira,"I was a fan when I was a kid, but I am sticking with this film especially because it is incredible, given that it is from 1954. With the effects they had at the time, this is by far one of the best movies ever made."
1.0,gojira,"very good, very sad, anti war and nuclear weapons movie"
1.0,gojira,This is the very first Godzilla movie for the period it was one of the best post war (WW2) films ever done. The original is a must see. Hands down.
1.0,gojira,"The best G-film period and also a landmark for Horror and Sci-Fi. This film paved the way for other Japanese films, shows, and games to become popular. A film that will go down in history."
1.0,gojira,"The best Godzilla film is the original. unlike every movie after this one, this is genuinly a good movie. (I do like all the other movies, but lets be real, their cheesy as hell.) This movie is full of symbolism about nuclear weapons. I urge everyone to see this movie."
1.0,gojira,"Not what you would expect from the King of the Monsters. This is him before the fame and foes acting as an analogy. a statement in post war Japanese fear and anxiety, a horror of it's time and classic of ours"
1.0,gojira,"Best monster movie, ever. Some of the camerawork is truly brilliant, and Godzilla is a great commentary on post-Hiroshima and Nagasaki Japan."
1.0,gojira,"The best Godzilla by far. Its raw film making doesnt patronise the viewer like most modern movies, allowing the simple effects, storyline and atmosphere work its magic."
1.0,gojira,The quintessential Japanese monster movie.
1.0,gojira,The movie that started it all. This movie i saw when i was a little kid and got me into the whole moster movie thing. I have been a fan every since and this movie captivates everything that is amazing about the original movie monster.
1.0,gojira,Do yourself a favour and look past the fact that there's a man in a lizard suit and don't let yourself miss this timeless sci-fi classic! It's was the catalyst for the giant monster movie and also drives home a deeper message about the horrors of nuclear weapons.
1.0,gojira,"The original, the classic. The one that started it all."
1.0,gojira,Great Nuclear Message without all the American Bastardizations.
1.0,gojira,One of the greatest films of all time
1.0,gojira,I've never quite gotten over this movie.
1.0,gojira,"The quintessential giant monster film. Arguably the only one in the genre that can be considered a masterpiece of cinema. Dark and somber in tone, with tons of subtleties. Easily on par with the best the movie world has to offer. Also, giant monster smashing shit."
1.0,gojira,The lack of respect given to this movie and Ishiro Honda sickens me.
1.0,gojira,EXCELLENT. I finally have seen the REAL version. And I loved it.
1.0,gojira,The original. Nothing more to say.
1.0,gojira,Best monster movie of all time.
1.0,gojira,"Finally, America gets to see the origonal film that made Godzilla a ledgend"
1.0,gojira,"It is the undisputed king of all monster movies, a dark and deeply disturbing metaphor for the monster that is American hubris."
1.0,gojira,"They should do a remake, but not like the one they already made. A japanese remake. 'Twould be sweet."
1.0,gojira,"Not just a fantastic monster movie, that's just the selling feature. It's a fantastic anti-war/anti-nuclear movie depicting scenes of struggle and hardship much like the aftermath of Hiroshima."
1.0,gojira,Legendary! That's all you need to know!
1.0,gojira,"Possibly the best monster movie made. Must have been chilling to see only 10 years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the anti-nuclear arms race message is much clearer in the original version."
1.0,gojira,"This is one of my favorite movies. A terrific anti-war film, one that could only have been made in postwar Japan. And, of course, it brought us the immortal character of Godzilla."
1.0,gojira,"A tense and terrifying monster movie, yes, but also a touching requiem for the horrors visited by World War II, and a call for nobility and self-sacrifice to return in the post-war age."
1.0,gojira,"The original, and best Godzilla is the most serious, dark and depressing of the series with an anti-war message that is as clear today as ever. Very strong characters and thought provoking writing lead this monster masterpiece."
1.0,gojira,My most favorite movie of all time. Not only is it about a giant monster destroying everything it also has a deep and inspiring message. To top it all off there's no Steve Martin. This started a life long obsession for these films.
1.0,gojira,Classic Japanese horror/sci-fi movie. I could sit through a 1000 of these things. I Love this stuff!
1.0,gojira,"Don't see Godzilla, see Gojira."
1.0,gojira,Perhaps the most misunderstood movie of all time. The Japanese version is without question a cinematic milestone.
1.0,gojira,"By far the best godzilla movie, especially the original japanese version without the american scenes in.Definately a defining moment in cinema history."
1.0,gojira,The original and best monster movie ever made.
1.0,gojira,Classics are the best not some movie remade over and over to make money...whom ever made this had something to get across to other people. obviously the attact on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But even in it seriousness still a great movie.
1.0,gojira,This movie pretty much changed my life. I like the original Japanese and Raymond Burr versions for different reasons.
1.0,gojira,"It's a classic and upon recent repeat viewings, an actual movie with characters and emotion and stuff. That was a nice surprise after watching every single other Godzilla movie."
1.0,gojira,Best Kaiju movie ever...hands down!
1.0,gojira,"The original Kaiju film as only Ishiro Honda could have told it. Here Godzilla is a tragic character, an animal who is trapped in a hostile world of technology that is not his own. Gojira is both an amazing and poignant film. That is, unless Raymond Burr comes around."
1.0,gojira,This is probably the best of all the Godzilla movies. I had to buy it when i saw the new DVD. This movie is too good for anyone to miss out on. It is a classic.
1.0,gojira,"The original Kaiju film as only Ishiro Honda could have told it. Here Godzilla is a tragic character, an animal who is trapped in a hostile world of technology that is not his own. Amazing and poignant. That is, unless Raymond Burr comes around."
1.0,gojira,"First-rate cinema, mainly due to Ishiro Honda's smart direction, Akira Ifukube's dread-filled score, and Eiji Tsubayara's special effects. Be sure to check the original Japanese cut and not the hacked up American version. The first Kaiju film is the most thoughtful and interesting."
1.0,gojira,This is the only version that should be viewed. The American version feels like a lobotomized abortion compared to the original Japanese cut.
1.0,gojira,One of the best monster movies.
1.0,gojira,"While I love the Raymond Burr version- and the many sequels- as camp fun, seeing this is like an epiphany. Who knew that a giant monster movie could be so profound, political and, yes, deep."
1.0,gojira,"Forget what you think you know about Godzilla movies, this is a beautiful anti-nuke film which really is king of the monsters. Timeless."
1.0,gojira,The original without Raymond Burr is an absolute masterpiece. What a way to symbolize the horror and destruction of the a-bomb after WWII. I highly recommend picking up the Special Anniversary Edition so that you can see both versions and (hopefully) agree with me. ^^
1.0,gojira,"The best Kaiju film ever, and I'm not jumping on the bandwagon when I say this. It truly is the greatest Kaiju eiga ever made. Don't believe me? Watch it and you'll see."
1.0,gojira,"I really recommend seeing the orgional film, it may defy expectations."
1.0,gojira,accept no imitations. the one and only gojira from the master of kaiju ishiro honda and toho studios
1.0,gojira,"I love the entire series to tell the truth, but the first installment is a nearly perfect bit of film and one of the best movies ever to come out of Japan."
1.0,gojira,The greatest Godzilla film of all time. And number 1 on my top ten list. Gojira is a classic monster film that gets way less credit than it deserves. A brilliant masterpiece in my eyes.
1.0,gojira,The embodiement of the feelings of horror and destruction of the atomic bomb in the form of a 30 story tall lizard.
1.0,gojira,If you can ignore the outdated special effects this is a great monster movie.
1.0,gojira,Japan has never escaped the shadow cast by the mushroom cloud. This is the embodiement of their terror. Not to be mistaken for the fluffier stuff that came later in the series.
1.0,gojira,"Best Godzilla movie ever, and a great allegory about nuclear weapons."
1.0,gojira,"This is a very good movie. Although it is a giant dinosaur, the Japanese know how to make a good monster movie. I can understand why this movie has a anti-nuke message, especially since the movie was released during the Cold War. I think this is a must see classic for everyone!"
1.0,gojira,"Godzilla is the greatest badass in monster history. Not even the Seventh Voyage of Sinbad dragon trumps the theme song and the radiation breath of this lizard. Sorry, Ray."
1.0,gojira,Amazing! I love this movie. YES!
1.0,gojira,one of the greats. all time classic must see monster film. next to king kong one of the most influential important films that few have seen. see the japanese version it truly is a masterpiece
1.0,gojira,the greatest monster film. original japanese version is the only version in my opinion. masterpiece
1.0,gojira,Original 1954 Japanese version of Godzilla without Raymond Burr present (but usa version is also included here). Ishiro Honda's film is a cinema classic.
1.0,gojira,"Somber, sad, haunting, and utterly essential. Really."
1.0,gojira,"The original ""Godzilla"" is still the best. An absolutely groundbreaking and revolutionary film, a monster movie with a message, it's somewhat cheapened by it's multitude of sequels."
1.0,gojira,"Far different from the Raymond Burr ""americanization"" an atomic allegory"
1.0,gojira,"The original Godzilla film was made as a horror film with symbolism to show the negative side to nuclear weapons, long before the campier and sillier films of the 60s and 70s."
1.0,gojira,One of the few horror movies that has a message that still has meaning.
1.0,gojira,Great film of iconic proportions
1.0,gojira,Finally we in the West can watch it without the American cut-ins and dub! Amazing film.
1.0,gojira,First and best. Ingore the man in suit and just watch the greatest film ever made in it full glory.
1.0,gojira,"The original, and still the best."
1.0,gojira,"Sort one of my favorite movies of all time. EVER. King Kong can bite my ass, at least Godzilla said something new, rather than ""it's beauty and the beast, but with GORILLAS and DINOSAURS""! I'll take socio-political commentary over flights of fantasy in at least THIS instance."
1.0,gojira,YEAH! Godzilla/Gojira rules either way! It's about time the original showed up on America's shores . . .
1.0,gojira,By far the greatest monster film ever created. This film does homage to the horror of the hydrogen bomb by artfully suggesting worldwide non-proliferation as the answer.
1.0,gojira,classic monster movie from Japan
1.0,gojira,Gojira (Godzilla) is far better than the American counterpart. I hope Toyo releases a restored version to DVD.
1.0,gojira,A true masterpiece on the horrors of war. Still relevent today. Don't be fooled by what you may have heard about Godzilla. Give this one a chance.
1.0,let_the_right_one_in,"Since the rise of the whiny Twilight type Vampire I started giving up on the genre, but one day I randomly caught it on TV and not only is my favourite Vampire movie ever made but is up there with my favourite movies I've ever seen."

1.0,let_the_right_one_in,"The English dub is awful. Completely disregard it. The actual film in its native tongue is a bitter sweet chocolate that you will still taste long after the credits finish. The camera work is some of my favorite of any movie. It's dark, lonely, compelling, and wonderful."
1.0,let_the_right_one_in,"""Let The Right One In"" is like a fairytale in vampire/horror style, it has brilliant story, a love story but never be lack of haunting event. This is the one of the best vampire film and one of highest quality romance film I've ever seen, and it made ""Twilight"" seems like a piece of trash."

1.0,let_the_right_one_in,"This is everything that Twilight could have been! Hey, OHY!! Stephanie Meyer! Look at this, and study it for God's sake! This is how the romance of vampires and humans are supposed to be played out! You should be ashamed of yourself woman!"

1.0,let_the_right_one_in,"Let the Right One In comes at a perfect time to reinvent vampires, making them more human and relatable rather than killers. Due to the high quality of the actors, the story, and the overall feel, this movie feels more like a movie about kids that features vampires in it."

1.0,let_the_right_one_in,As good as film making gets
1.0,let_the_right_one_in,"I'm not a fan of vampires, or movies about kids. But oh, is this so much more than that. Filled with symbolism and metaphors, Let The Right One In is an artsy and beautiful atmospheric film, that treats its violence and brutality with respect."

1.0,let_the_right_one_in,"Not only is this one of the most unique stories of all time, but what I believe to be a truly harrowing love story. It pairs horror with romance seamlessly and makes you feel for these fictional characters (even the undead one) as though they're as real as the sun."

1.0,let_the_right_one_in,an amazing film with great characters in it
1.0,let_the_right_one_in,"An absolutely fantastic romantic-drama that grafts a love story to the preternatural vamipre legend. Although horredous and violent in places, not a typical scary horror movie but the social and environmental survival tale of two young children whose friendship develops to depandance. Brilliant!"

1.0,let_the_right_one_in,"This film does what seemed impossible: taken what has become a glossy, over-stylized, and altogether ridiculous genre and made an artful, well-crafted film with an engaging, original narrative and refreshingly simplistic shots that will stick with you to the end."
1.0,let_the_right_one_in,"PHENOMENAL. True horror movie. Didn't need all that gore and nonsense american movies use, it scared me on a much deeper level too. What life would really be like if vampires were real. She doesn't need to sparkle, and she's more of a man than Edward."

1.0,descent,Overwhelming intensity grabs the viewer by the throat and doesn't let go for a second. This one will stick with you long after the credits have ended. The R-rated version cuts a minute out of the climax causing it to lose some of it's power. The unrated version is recommended.
1.0,descent,"The score to this film gives such an overwelming sense of emptiness...I can't imagine being in a cave with cannibalistic creatures hunting me. I always loved doing unexpected things in the wild, but going in a cave like that was never one of them. Very scary."

0.0,house_of_the_devil,"Se ninguém contasse eu acharia que é um filme da década de 1970/80. Pena que esta homenagem aos filmes de terror antigos seja tão parada e decepcionante. Demora um eternidade para algo acontecer, e no final ocorre tudo de uma só vez, e rápido demais."

1.0,the_vanishing,thrilling shocking and still super relaxing
1.0,the_vanishing,One of the better serial killer films-- if not the best one of the 80s-- which makes the American version seem like a children's cartoon. A must-see for serial killer films...

1.0,the_vanishing,I just freaked out at the ending!
0.0,the_vanishing,Had to leave this one behind on the road trip -before the ending. Typically overall drawn out horror which leaves one thinking there are some very mentally disturbed humans who think up this crap.

1.0,the_vanishing,"Yes, it's an art film BUT it is also the best portrayal of a sociopath in film. Stick with it because it is a wrenching tale of desperation and loss. Truly terrifying. Please don't ever see the American version."

1.0,the_vanishing,"This film is sets up it's white knuckle climax like a stack of dominoes. When the finale hits it does so not with a shocking twist, but with the cold dread of inevitable horror."
1.0,the_vanishing,The original version with the brilliantly dark ending it deserves (rather than the wimpout of the US remake!).
1.0,the_vanishing,this is a classic thriller i want to thank my girlfriend for showing this to me you sick sweet little puppy
1.0,the_vanishing,the ending has to be one of the most devastating and creepy moments in the history of cinema. a brilliant thriller.
1.0,the_vanishing,"An excellently handled examination of human obsession, frailty, and cruelty, this film will always be remembered for the stark ending, but the only thing that makes it pay off is the beauty of everything leading up to it."
1.0,the_vanishing,YOU WILL NEVER FORGET THIS FILM.NEVER.
1.0,the_vanishing,"There's a lot of horror movies out there, but this one is one of the few that haunt you for months, if not years, after viewing. You have veins of ice if the climax doesn't give you chills by simply thinking about it."
1.0,the_vanishing,"Couldn't sleep a wink after watching this the first time. Not particularly scary, but the ending will leave your jaw gaping. Leave the American remake alone if you have any sense at all."
1.0,the_vanishing,Somehow a film free of onscreen violence and steeped in philosophical discussions of free will and the individual still manages to be one of the most fast-paced and uncomfortable horror films made in the past 20 years.
1.0,the_vanishing,The scariest movie I have ever seen. Period. Jesus fucking Christ this is terrifying.
1.0,the_vanishing,My favorite horror movie.

1.0,the_vanishing,"fuck the dumb american remake, this will send chills down your spine"

1.0,the_vanishing,Much better than the american remake
1.0,the_vanishing,"Classic cat and mouse mystery with twists and turns abound. This is the original version of the American remake (starring Kiefer Sutherland and Jeff Bridges), void of the Hollywood touch (which inherently dilludes substance). This is an absolute must see for anyone who truly loves filmmaking."
1.0,the_vanishing,"One of the best films ever! Dark, claustrophobic, atmospheric. Perfect."
1.0,the_vanishing,One of those great movies that stays with you long after it is over.

1.0,the_vanishing,"to me, this is the pinnacle of filmmaking. there is something so fundamentally brilliant about the sheer horror of raymond's familiarity."
1.0,the_vanishing,"Pure, pure genius. everything this movie threatens it delivers. the strength is entirely in the suspense and anyone who wants to feel terrified without the need for gore but with the sheer power of their own imagination need look no further. A masterpiece."
1.0,the_vanishing,"This movie left me looking over my shoulder for hours, if not a couple of days after finishing it. Nauseatingly immediate and philosophically complex, pointedly disturbing--this is how haunting all movies should be."
1.0,the_vanishing,One of the greatest thrillers ever made. Not much comes close.
1.0,the_vanishing,"You have to see this film if only for the ending. Other than that it's a brilliant look at one story and how it consumes the lives of those affected--extremely haunting, another film that will remain in my top ten forever."
1.0,the_vanishing,Absolutely brilliant- a creepy classic. Haven't seen the American remake and don't want to.
1.0,the_vanishing,"Spoorloos is a masterpiece of intellectual horror, using psychological tension rather than gore to frighten. The film progresses slowly, allowing ample time for character and plot development, all leading up to a truly chilling finish. Highly recommended for all!"
1.0,the_vanishing,"Probably the best serial killer movie ever made. Great characters. Great suspense. Perfect script. Oh, and this is NOT the American POS remake by the way!"

1.0,28_days_later,Very engaging. Onya Danny.
1.0,28_days_later,"This is not your typical zombie movie: it's better. In zombie movies you try not to get too attached to anyone, but they make it impossible not to. It's frustrating, it's sad, it makes you feel a lot for them. A great movie."

1.0,28_days_later,"Love this film, can you imagine waking up and everyone being gone...freeeeky shit man"
1.0,28_days_later,I thoroughly enjoyed this. Its very rare that you get a British horror worthy. This film defiantly stands up against the rest and set the standard for future films. Cillian Murphy is a brilliant actor and this film highlighted that.
1.0,28_days_later,my favorite zombie movie ever
1.0,28_days_later,"""Zombies"" that aren't crap. Gorefest."
1.0,28_days_later,Not quite a zombie movie but is a great and entertaining romp through empty streets while infected mobs are after you. Danny Boyle creates an apocalyptic vision in modern times and makes a nice survival and character study. The whole beginning is special
1.0,28_days_later,"In the House - In a Heartbeat, best use of a song in a movie"
1.0,28_days_later,"Great zombie movie, top 3 zombie movies ever but not the best. This movie has a lot of the aspects of the walking dead tv show, even made music that the walking dead used. Long story short good movie, good suspense, running zombies, good ending."

1.0,28_days_later,Terrific but flawed when the writer of this movie who ran out of ideas and turned it into a man stopping two girls from getting raped (retarted) They should have rolled credits at the scene where the father is infected

1.0,28_days_later,"A sophisticated, emotional, creepy and beautiful zombie (or virus) film. The thought-provoking themes are dealt with perfectly, and the scenes of a empty London are haunting. It's not all perfect, but it's pretty bloody brilliant."

1.0,28_days_later,"It's extremely scary. And if you count it as a zombie movie, one of the best zombie movies ever, and perhaps definitely the scariest, and if you only count it as a viral outbreak movie, then it's the best iv'e seen."

1.0,1006234-dracula,Magnificent. Bela lugosi is unforgetable as count dracula.
1.0,1006234-dracula,"Robert Pattison sure could use a good lesson on how to be a vampire from Bela Lugosi! Lugosi portrays the classic vampire in such a way that it has set the bar high ever since this film's release. To add to that, the film itself is a masterpiece."
1.0,1006234-dracula,One of the greatest horror films. Bela Legosi gives probably his best performance. The mood and atmosphere are absolutely chilling.
1.0,1006234-dracula,Dracula is one of those classic horror films that relies heavily on atmosphere and tension-building rather than jump scares or blood and gore. The story is interesting and the acting is strong. It set the standard for Dracula adaptations and simply vampire movies to come.
1.0,1006234-dracula,"Dracula is a great spooky film. This movie has a phenomenal cast and a highly creepy nightmarish atmosphere. Yes it has some flaws, but it reminds me of Eraserhead (1977) with its hypnotic moments of silence."
1.0,1006234-dracula,One of the big reasons we remember universal horror
1.0,1006234-dracula,"A old movie that still is a masterpice to this day, Bella Lugosi shows of who is the REAL dracula and makes hes famous lines like ""I am Dracula"" who everyone loves and remembers love it to death may they never make a remake of this movie"
1.0,1006234-dracula,Grade: A Dracula is a true horror master about the most famous vampire. Genuinely creepy thanks to the performance by Dwight Frye and Bela Lugosi. This classic tale is fantastic and entertaining that any generation can enjoy.
1.0,1006234-dracula,"First Official Film Version, First & Best English Version Only To Be Out-Done By The Spanish Version Recorded On The Same Set At The Same Time As Dubbing Was Not Possible In 1931."

1.0,1006234-dracula,"A perfect horror film, with the best performance of Dracula of all-time by Bela Lugosi."
1.0,1006234-dracula,"In this day and age, it is cheesey enough to be considered a comedy, but tga is not the case. Dracula ignited my love for all things Vampiric, which Edward Cullen practically killed."
1.0,1006234-dracula,Bela Lugosi set the template for lead vampire roles with his ageless depiction of Dracula in this eerie and moody 1931 movie.
1.0,1006234-dracula,A classic one of Bela Lugosi's best movies in my opinnion. More people should watch this movie and see a classic at its best.

1.0,1006234-dracula,Not scary anymore but still incredibly iconic and influential
1.0,1006234-dracula,I grew up on the universal monsters movies. This film is a timeless classic and Bela Lugios acting is legnadary even to this day.
1.0,1006234-dracula,This film is 81 years old and the fact that it is still apart of our culture now shows how great it truly is.
1.0,1006234-dracula,The Hungarian master at his best.
1.0,1006234-dracula,Bela Lugosi is just like his Dracula: Immortal.
1.0,1006234-dracula,classic horror movie. Bela is like no other.
1.0,1006234-dracula,Still creepy after all these years. Bela is great.
0.0,1006234-dracula,It had glorious atmosphere but the wrecked storyline is unforgivable as well as the poor acting. Even for 1931 this was abysmal.
1.0,1006234-dracula,One of the most mesmerizing performances ever captured on film.
1.0,1006234-dracula,The best vampire movie ever made!
1.0,1006234-dracula,"Bela Lugosi kills it as the terrifying vampire, Dracula. Based on the novel by Bram Stoker, Dracula is nonetheless chilling, creepy, and overall, one of the greatest cinematic films ever."

1.0,1006234-dracula,The best Dracula ever made. I like Chrstopher Lee but Bela will always be the Count.
1.0,1006234-dracula,"The definitive Dracula. After 80 years, this atmospheric film remains chilling thanks to Lugosi's unique portrayal of the infamous Count. Dwight Frye as the lunatic Renfield and Edward Van Sloan as the methodical vampire expert Van Helsing remain unmatched as classic interpretations."
1.0,1006234-dracula,Great Movie Bela Luggosi is one of the greatwst actoors of all times
1.0,1006234-dracula,Bela Legosi brought class and style to the character Dracula that will last an eternity.
1.0,1006234-dracula,"Classic, it's no wonder Bela Lugosi was buried in the cape. He is the best Dracula."
1.0,1006234-dracula,The definitive version of Dracula with the definitive performance of the said Count played with remarkable menace by the superb Bela Lugosi. Based on the play that was based on the book it is exceptional.
1.0,1006234-dracula,"LOL of the two filmss Frankenstein and Dracula, this film was much better thought out. character development was better thought out. direction was well done. Over all Dracula was a much better film than Frankenstein ever hoped to be."

0.0,1006234-dracula,"Most people view this as a classic, and I do to an extent. This is the film that set the norm for any Dracula film, but as a stand alone movie it is very boring and slow moving."
1.0,1006234-dracula,"Lugosi is superb and truly gives the legend a fantastic vision, yes effects are not spectacular (but this is 1931 and not avatar...) but give a genuine feel to the movie. the setpieces are incredible, dialogue intelligent and a genuinely great movie"
1.0,1006234-dracula,A solid classic of the horror genre that immortalized the figure of the famous Count Dracula played by Bela Lugosi.
1.0,1006234-dracula,"the movie that introduced us all to the count, and what is considered one of the most famous horror movie monsters to this day.theres and air of suspense and creepyness surrounding the film which i likelugosi does a great job as dracula, mysterious and creepy"
1.0,1006234-dracula,EXCELLENT! Bela Lugosi was born to play this role. A horror classic. The best of the best!
1.0,1006234-dracula,"There's a certain charm and atmosphere to watching a classic like this, even if it's terror is tame by today's standards. Bela Lugosi is still the prototypical Dracula, over 70 years later."
1.0,1006234-dracula,awesomebela lugosi has te scariest look ever.
1.0,1006234-dracula,"LOL of the two filmss Frankenstein and Dracula, this film was much better thought out. character development was better thought out. direction was well done. Over all Dracula was a much better film than Frankenstein ever hoped to be."

1.0,1006234-dracula,"The one and only Dracula movie that did it right.... focusing on what really matters in Bram Stoker's novel - a flawless adaptation to say the least with jaw dropping, spine chilling performance by Dwight Frye"
1.0,1006234-dracula,"80 years later, it reigns as one of the greatest horror classics of all time. Lugosi is terrific with his devilish stare and his Hungarian accent. An iconic piece of American film."
1.0,1006234-dracula,"Haha, YES!!! A horror classic! This is a terrific movie for any horror fan"
1.0,1006234-dracula,While the somewhat primitive effects make it feel a tad flat Dracula is a brilliant film thanks to the timeless performance from Bela Lugosi as the charming and menacing Count Dracula.

1.0,1006234-dracula,"It's a classic for the atmosphere, music and... well... Bela Lugosi!"

1.0,1006234-dracula,"It's the best vampire movie their is. (SUCK ON THAT!, TWILIGHT!!)"
1.0,1006234-dracula,this is fucking classic
1.0,1006234-dracula,"The greatest Dracula film of all time, though it could be debated that the Hammer Films adaptation is just as good. A very interesting interpretation of the classic story, combining some of the novels characters coherently to make for a better run time."
1.0,1006234-dracula,"Amazing acting, sets, and plot. This a must have for any old horror or vampire movie collection."
1.0,1006234-dracula,I enjoyed this movie the acting is a little stiff at times but Bela Lugosi does a great job as Count Dracula his performance holds the film together
1.0,1006234-dracula,"A True-Vampire tale, not about a certain sparkly non-vampire."
0.0,1006234-dracula,bela lugosi did a fantastic job as dracula but this movie was such a disappointment. now ive read the book before and the whole movie just fell flat to me. Now it wasnt terrible ive seen worse but this movie is just not that entertaining to sit down and watch
1.0,1006234-dracula,"Creepy atmosphere, wonderful set peices, and best Dracula portrayal ever. I loved this classic film so much. It was wonderfully played and it was surly a horror masterpiece. I mean from the 1930's this is just amazing."
1.0,1006234-dracula,"While I definately prefer Frankenstein over Dracula, the fact that a film made in 1931 can still be unsettling is astonishing. Count Dracula played by Bela Lugosi and Renfield played by Dwight Frye are still two of the creepiest characters in cinema history."
1.0,1006234-dracula,A timeless movie! Amazing performances from Bela Lugosi and Dwight Frye.
1.0,1006234-dracula,The ultimate universal horror classic
1.0,1006234-dracula,"Lugosi's famous role, Dracula, will never be played this way again. He is brilliant, and this movie is spectacular. I love it."

1.0,1006234-dracula,Well i said nosferatu waas the best dracula movie but it is the best talky dracula film and it puts you in a creepy atmosphere and the best story.
1.0,1006234-dracula,Still one of the greatest movies ever made.
1.0,1006234-dracula,Clasico del horror. Bela Lugosi en su esplendor.
1.0,1006234-dracula,"This movie is legendary, iconic and is an excellent adaptation of an excellent book."
1.0,1006234-dracula,Bela Lugosi. What can I say? Perhaps you preferred Christopher Lee. Very good choice. Even Max Schreck as the insidious looking Nosferatu is well worth your time. Anybody else? No thanks.
0.0,1006234-dracula,hahaha this brings back memories...
1.0,1006234-dracula,I can't even come up with the words to describe this movie. Its just amazing. Probably the best horror movie I've ever seen.
1.0,1006234-dracula,"Despite its fairly extreme departures from the source novel, this film remains the definitive Dracula interpretation, mainly due to the great production design and Lugosi's legendary, iconic performance."
1.0,1006234-dracula,there are so many i hope this is the one with the real dracula well i dont know how to spell his name but it starts with a b
1.0,1006234-dracula,"My favourite movie and maybe the best vampire movie of all time! This is how a Vampire movie should be! ""I never drink..... Wine."""
1.0,1006234-dracula,"It might not be as bloody as I expected it to be, But Bella Lugosi did a fantastic job as Dracula, the movie is so dark and spookey and suspenful, although it might feel slow at some points it's still a masterpiece which defined the way for future horror films to come"
1.0,1006234-dracula,"While this film does seem very boring at some points, I still think that this film launched the career of legendary Bela Legousi, the world's most famous Hungarian actor. The film ends on just the right note, not leaving it open for a direct sequel. Great for Halloween."
1.0,1006234-dracula,This movie left a legacy in Universal Studios and it left a legacy in actors who played Dracula afterwords. It also came in at a good time during the Great Depression when movies were the only thing that people could go to and forget about the hard times. This movie has history behind it!
1.0,1006234-dracula,classic movie as well. the cinematography is amazing. must see for anyone :)
1.0,1006234-dracula,The movie that set the standard for all Horror movies! Iconic performances by Bela Lugosi AND Edward Van Sloan provides a brilliant set-up for this atmospheric monster classic!
1.0,1006234-dracula,"The first horror film with sound and one of the all time greatest. Bela Lugosi was born to play the count. Every incarnation since has tried, and though some have close, none have equaled Lugosi's performance or Tod Browning's direction."
1.0,1006234-dracula,"by far the best and definitive Dracula. a true classic and paved the way for almost every movie that followed it. it will always be my favorite horror movie of all time. if you haven't seen it, it's a must"
1.0,1006234-dracula,"What more could you want in a chiller - castles, fog, bats, ""children of the night,"" and Bela Lugosi too? Perhaps the best and greatest of Universal Studio's ""golden age"" monster movies."
1.0,1006234-dracula,A classic in every sense.
1.0,1006234-dracula,"With all the horrible new vampire movies coming out these days, it is nice to remember a time when Hollywood actually knew how to put out a decent blood-sucker film. And what could be greater than the original movie about the most famous vampire of all, Count Dracula."
1.0,1006234-dracula,"A horror classic. A film that should never be missed. It deserves a spot as one of the best films ever made, as it is a terrific film that has almost everything right in it. This film earns my highest recommendation."

1.0,1006234-dracula,"Is it just me, or﻿ did I just hear the sound Bela Lugosi rising from the dead, going to Edward Cullen's house and bitch smacking him in the face? This is the epitome of a vampire flick, and a permanent image of the Gothic chillers of the 30's.   Bela Lugosi RIP"
1.0,1006234-dracula,"Classic. Truly marvelous take on Stoker's book. Lugosi shines as the Count and the whole story executes so smoothly. The definition of brilliant horror cinema. ""Listen to them, Children of the Night, what music they make."" Genuinly one of the greatest films ever made."

1.0,1006234-dracula,"This is the movie that set the horror genre into action.

1.0,1006234-dracula,Bela Lugosi and the rest of his Cast are purely and simply incredible in this Movie. Just to listen to Dwight Frye's insane Laugh is enough to see the Movie for! Oh and I love how Dracula ignores what you say and says whatever he wants to say! lol
1.0,1006234-dracula,Bella Lugosi is the one & only Dracula to me. The movie is filled with classic quotes and famous scenes. As a big time classic horror fanatic I rate it 5 stars.

1.0,1006234-dracula,"I don't care what any of you might think of the old Count, Dracula is still the original gangsta of bloodsuckers, suckas. If it weren't for him, Count Chocula cereal would just be called Chocolate Flavored Cereal Wit' Chocolate Flavored Marshmellows In It. So pay 'em his due propers. Suckas."
1.0,1006234-dracula,"Man, this is the real thing."
1.0,1006234-dracula,"The single greatest portrayal of a vampire ever recorded on film. Bela Lugosi makes me smile every time I hear ""Good Evening"""

1.0,1006234-dracula,THE ONE THAT STARTED IT ALL!!!
1.0,1006234-dracula,Bela Lugosi was unquestionably the best Dracula and Dwight Frye was the best Renfield. This is a classic that will never be forgotten.

1.0,1006234-dracula,a very great horror film from the 30s made by the studio universal
1.0,1006234-dracula,"Bela Lugosi was able to step into this role perfectly as THE consumate Dracula, and very good direction by Tod Browning."
1.0,1006234-dracula,"Bela Lugosi is Classic Universal, Dwight Frye is the strangest & scariest Renfield in some ways the best. good movie definatly a movie you have to see at least once"
1.0,1006234-dracula,Truly one of the great horror movies of the time. Bela Lugosi's performance is mesmorizing.
1.0,1006234-dracula,An absolute classic!
0.0,1006234-dracula,I did not really like this movie.
1.0,1006234-dracula,"This is the greatest vampire movie ever, only followed very closely by Nosferatu; altough the latter has better argument, Bela Lugosi is simply... perfect. He IS the movie. Also, castle Dracula is really scary. A must for the horror fan."
1.0,1006234-dracula,Bela Lugosi was the best dracula
1.0,1006234-dracula,"Bela Lugosi's performance as Dracula is simply legendary, and with the 75th anniversary edition DVD you get both the american and spanish movies, both very good in their own different ways."
1.0,1006234-dracula,If only I got my hands on the Spanish version.
1.0,1006234-dracula,old school vampire classics are still great to me....
1.0,1006234-dracula,"One of horror cinema's most sacared classics, nicely adapted from Bram Stoker's novel. Bella Lugosi gives the performance as a lifetime as the greatest Dracula of them all."
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,"One of Herzog's finest. It was filmed twice, once in English, once in German. There are subtle differences in the way the scenes play out b/w the two. Surprisingly, the English version (Nosferatu: The Vampyre) is probably the better of the two."
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,One of the most creepy and atmospheric horror I've ever seen. Based on the 1922 black and white silent film that I've only seen once and will never see again. It's too horrifying.
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,"Ambient and stylish. Heavy on the creepy, easy on the gore. A real masterpiece! Klaus Kinski delivered a performance that Bela Lugosi would have envied."
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,"Eerie remake that definitely stands on its own, with every aspect perfect in it."
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,The 1979 remake of the 1922 horror masterpiece is the closest any movie could come to matching the status of its original from the beautiful visual direction of Werner Herzog to the strong depiction of the legendary vampire by Klaus Kinski.
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,"Desperately unsettling, and masterfully framed, you hang on every scene to the very last frame just waiting for the slow villain to do something; and when he does, you'll always feel your skin itch."
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,"Quite simply, the best Dracula film ever made. Stunning visuals from the opening shot to the very last scene. One of the most atmospheric horror films ever made and a masterpiece of any cinema genre."

1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,The best vampire movie ever made!
0.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,A clumsily made film complete with Amsterdam trying to be somewhere else and grainy file footage of a bat flying in slomo. Bad acting rounds it out.
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,"'Zog und 'Ski are the perfect fit for one of the most ponderous, haunting, and wildly ambitious vampire flicks to date."
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,"Beautiful, haunting, with a suitably creepy performance by Kinski. Oh! And it's got Wagner music too!"

0.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,"Music was prolly the best parts of the film, not that into it...maybe some shadows were well done but thats it."
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,Herzog's remake of the Murnau classic is a poetic masterpiece in and of itself.
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,Herzog approaches the Darcula story in such a human way that we actually sympathise with the Count. And Klaus Kinski makes for the perfect vampyre.
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,Possibly the best vampire movie ever made.
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,the one that started them all
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,"A remake that does not only honor the original, it also turns out to be one of, if not, the best vampire movie I have seen. This is the greatest Herzog/Kinski collaboration. And that is saying a lot!"
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,My favorite vampire movie of all time.
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,This one was really creepy. Herzog's style and camera work was magnificent.
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,"Herzog's take on the vampire mythos starts off remarkably faithful, but halfway through veers off into a marvelous deconstruction of the sexual politics inherent in vampire stories. Delightfully strange and full of great, creepy imagery."
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,Awesome underrated horror masterpiece. Also one of the best re-makes around. dare I say *gasp* better than the original.
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,"Definitely, one of the most beautiful vampire films I have ever seen! It's very disturbing! Klaus Kinski is haunting and repulsive! He knows exactly how to get under your skin! This is the perfect movie to watch on a cold October night!"
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,I like it better than the original. Herzog is one of the most breath-taking directors.
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,the best vampire movie of all time
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,"this film, just like the original, is visually amazing. i wouldn't necessarily call it the same movie as the original, because it isn't. it has something of more beauty to it, mainly because we get a sense of who the vampire really is."
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,Amazing performances by Kinski and Adjani and one of the greatest horror movies ever made....
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,"Bruno Ganz and Klaus Kinski in a film directed by Werner Herzog, you can't beat that. This is definitely my favorite version of the classic Bram Stoker's Dracula."
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,Yeah!! THIS is what a vampire movie should be like! This is so much better than Twilight on SO many levels I'm not gonna even start explaining..! (this is just for my twilight-fan friends ;))
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,Brilliant remake of the even more brilliant 1922 original.
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,la reinvencion de los vampiros por werner herzog es una maravilla del cine.
0.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,"Bueno para los amantes de los seres nocturnos es una peli para cultura general. Ya k Nosferatu de Murnau es la efectiva, el tono dramàtico de este film debido a la psicologìa del mismo es genial."

0.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,excrutianingly boring.
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,"the book is okay, too"
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,"The most beautiful of all vampire movies, sticking to genre rules and simultaneously breaking them. Nosferatu is an extremely stylized affair of a movie, but with Kinski adding some tragedy and weakness to his character, this archetypical horror figure almost becomes human."
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,I bought this because it is a beautifully filmed movie as well as a good story. One of Klaus Kinsk's best roles.
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,This film gives the horror genre merit.
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,"Kinski is creepy as Adjani is beautiful, this movie seems to float as a ghost, incredibly beautiful."
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,"Yes I know, I just reviewed the original. But this one also need to be mentioned. For as great as the original is, this one is better if only just a little. Klaus Kinski does a great job of paying homage to Max Shreck's Original role while making the part his own."
0.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,"One of the worst Dracula movies. It's a disaster. I watch it in open-air cinema and everyone, including me, were laughing our pants of. Meh, it's better to laugh than to get angry. And this Dracula REALLY likes boobs. Yes, yes, go watch it, than you'll see."
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,"Subtly compelling, brilliantly acted"
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,"Without a doubt, my favorite telling of Bram Stoker's finest work. Klaus Kinski is incredible and for the story behind the story don't forget to check out Herzog's commentary track on the DVD!"
0.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,Sorry for Klaus. It is too serious movie. Such horror movies (same it's for Coppola's Dracula) are not for me. A world of boredom.

1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,"The FIRST vampire movie made i believe. it is so amaising to see film like this, it is not for entertainment to be watched when pleased, this is a peice of art, to be watched over again, and if you do not take the time to apprecate art like this, you do not deserve to watch movies."
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,Herzog-Kinski masterpiece. Scary as shit and funny too.

1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,"Far and away the best version of ""Dracula"" that I've ever seen because it has something that the other versions don't: atmosphere. Ominous, ghostly, and very fucking creepy atmosphere. Look at it this way: it opens with a shot of a screaming mummy."

1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,A must have classic for the vampyre lover..
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,"Herzog's remake of the ultimate horror movie. Kinski is dynamite, bringing the kind of atmosphere and tension only his distorted face could. much more melancholic than the original, and probably it's equal but for different reasons."
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,This stands as the greatest remake of all time. People think that Kinski was a nut... maybe. But this is the creepiest performance ever.
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,"For once, the remake is even better than the original. Spectacular.I found a review that captures the movie perfectly by Vincent Canby:It's funny without being silly, eerie without being foolish and uncommonly beautiful in a way that has nothing to do with mere prettiness."
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,"A great remake. Though usually not a good idea to remake movies,Kinski is the scariest man to ever live."
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,"Herzog se lucio totalmente con este remake, es asombrosa, no solo impregna su propio estilo expresionista sino que le adhiere una critica social muy fuerte a la podredumbre e inmundicia de la Alemania de entreguerras."
1.0,nosferatu_the_vampyre,"first of all this movie is not PG, its X, no lie. it is so incredibly gory and filled with intense sexuality...but its the best vampire movie ive ever ever seen! klaus kinski is the creepiest rat-looking dracula of all time, and this is a serious must-see for any horror fan!"

1.0,1007818-frankenstein,This is just phenomenal. There is a reason it is considered a classic. One of my favorite films to this very day. 10/10
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Immediately iconic, Boris Karloff is amazing, Frankenstein is the greatest of the Universal Monsters."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Despite being in someways radically different from the book, Frankenstein the movie, is still able to hold it's own against the critically acclaimed novel, whilst both complimenting and changing the source material to it's particular needs and specifications."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,I give this a 92/A-.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Boris Karloff will always be the best movie monster of all time, and has set the stage for many inspirations to come in the decades! A cinematic masterpiece from beginning to end!"
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Frankenstein is stylized, dark, and a highly influential piece of cinema. It does stray much from Shelley's original vision, but it also creates an unforgettable story full of haunting images."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Colin Clive's mad performance and the legendary Boris Karloff dominate this classic. It's a shame that Clive died so young. His nuanced performance, alongside the moody but innocent Karloff, make this a genre standout that is imitated even today."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Still a FANTASTIC Film! While maybe not the scariest film I've seen (back then it was!), but the film is well-acted, has a good story showing the monster is not really bad but just misunderstood, good pacing and is just a classic!"

1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Boris Karloff is perfect to play as the Frankenstein. The movie is such a classic science fiction.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"One of the greatest monster films ever. This and ""Bride"" just may be the Universal Monster series' best."

1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"""That's Frank-en-steen"" (from ""Young Frankenstein""). I really loved this classic based on Mary Shelley's book. It's not frightening at all; more warm then anything else. A winner!"
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,The film's merrit is earned in Whale's direction and Karloff's brilliant performance rather than total purity to Shelley's novel. Truly a film classic worth watching again for the sake of pure cinematic elements. One of the best horror movies ever made.

1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Great performances all around make this an endearing horror classic. A great reflection of how humankind can be more monstrous than any ""monster"" that can be created by man. Karloff is amazing at garnering sympathy even with his brutish visage."

1.0,1007818-frankenstein,The iconic horror movie.
0.0,1007818-frankenstein,"By all means, i wont watch this again."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"It's as classic now as it ever was, despite having very little shock value anymore, and a few rather silly scenes."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Frankenstein scared me to death when I was a kid. Boris Karloff is fabulous as the frightening, but misunderstood monster."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,One of the all-time great horror flicks. I can't get enough Karloff.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Iconic horror film, dated but still impressive."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,A disturbing bet yet eye opening film of what happens when man himself decides to become the creator instead of letting nature take it's normal route.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Classic meditation on: beauty,death,size discrimination,the origins of crime,childbirth and many other deep themes in this awesome movie."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Classic! Boris Karloff was awesome as the Monster.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Deviating from the novel, which is my favorite of the Victorian era, the fact that it was concocted by a group of simple Hollywood marketers is quite apparent. I new it would be campy, but I think that aspect made it funner to watch."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"One of my favorite movies. Brilliantly made. Even better perhaps, than the often touted Bride of Frankenstein."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Horror in all its glory!

1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"I love this Movie to death! I like it just as much as the Wolf Man, my favorite! It has a great storyline, and by the end, you feel sympathy for the Monster. I think Boris Karloff is the best Frankenstein so far! ;)"
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Frankenstein is my favorite classic horror series. Boris Karloff is the perfect actor to play the monster. In the end I really end up feeling bad for him b/c he tries so hard to fit in nobody accepts him.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Boris Karloff rules.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,I'd fuck this movie. Seriously.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Frankenstein is the best monster on the face of the entire earth, and Boris Karloff is the best Frankenstein on the face of the earth."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"The classic Universal version of Frankenstein. Despite taking a few liberties with the source material (including changing Dr. Frankenstein's first name), the film remains a classic after 77 years and its not hard to see why."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,not only one of the best horror movies ever...but one of the best movies ever.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Saw it when I was 5 years old. First horror movie I ever saw. I've been in love with it ever since.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,I always think about Bela Legosi in 'Ed Wood' calling Boris Karloff a cocksucker. But this is still a classic.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"The finest horror film ever made. James Whale is a great director. And Karloff, what an amazing, talented actor. He is responsible for the worlds greatest horror icon."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"IMO, it's still the greatest! It's so iconic and has impacted every good horror director. The monster is loose!"
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Greatest and most influencial movie ever made!
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,James Whale's masterful adaptation of Shelley's tale of family tragedy and science gone wrong. Not quite DRACULA but one of Universal's horror lynchpins.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Boris Karloff! Classic
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,A horror film classic!!!! This is my favorite Universal Monster.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Boris Karloff is amazing in this film as the not-so-gentle giant. An all-time classic.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"A materpiece. From Boris Karloff's brilliant pantomime to Colin Clive's manic jadeness this is a classic. The production design, from the expressionist motifs to the legendary laboratory are iconic."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,A classic for a reason.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Karloff is once again amazing and doesn't utter a complete sentence in the film. Wonder what it would have been like if Lugosi had not turned down the roll of the Monster?????
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Still stands the test of time
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Hollywood has made some really, really great films: Casablanca, this...I'm sure there are others."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Universal did no wrong in the '30s and '40s when it came to monster movies.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,Karloff in his most memorable role. Great!
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,This is the very best of the Universal Monsters era...the golden age of horror ghouls. I love Frank!
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"OK, this had NOTHING to do with the book, but broke new ground, regardless."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"Dear lord!! There is something about this movie that gets me. Older horror movies, with the grainy dark black and white cinematography, always have that particular creepy thing going for them and this is the one that REALLY took it home. It still is creepy today IMO."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,I am a big fan of the classics and this is one of my faves.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,possibly the greatest horror movie of all time. karloff was the mannn.
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"A perfect horror film, even if it's dated. Man playing God is never good. Clive is just about the worst parent in film history, and Karloff's performance is probably as great as any I've seen."
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,the original frankenstein film rules
1.0,1007818-frankenstein,"An absolute wonder! It may not be all that faithful to Mary Shelly's gothic tome, but it's iconic nonetheless. Karloff is extraordinary, you'll feast on the cinematic wizardry on display."
1.0,exorcist,Best scary movie of all time !

1.0,exorcist,The Exorcist bolds it's revolutionary effects and performances from Linda Blair's Possessed Regan to Ellen Burstyn's Tormented Chris in one of the biggest game-changers of it's time
1.0,exorcist,"The only movie that made me spooked out. This film's original theatrical release is the best version. Later director cuts are good, but some cheesy effects were added that take away from the original release."

1.0,exorcist,"I'm just gonna start off by saying if you haven't seen The Exorcist, you are not a true horror fan. What can I say that hasn't been said already? The Exorcist is definitely the scariest movie of all time and definitely one of the greatest aside from The Shining. It's a must see horror movie."
1.0,exorcist,"okay, here goes: my favorite movie. 'nuf said. fade out. the end...."
1.0,exorcist,"Friedkin and Blatty masterfully explore the mystery of faith, the danger in valuing intellect above belief, self-sacrifice, and a parents devotion. This is a truly terrifying and deeply affecting masterpiece."
1.0,exorcist,"I am late to the game but what a fantastic film. Having never seen it, and having seen modern horror type films, it;'s altogether a more tense affair, if not a touch less scary as a result. Still, its effect on the genre today is clear."
1.0,exorcist,"My favorite movie of all time, no doubt."
1.0,exorcist,"Simply the best, a masterpiece. Should have won the Oscar in 1974 for Best Picture if the academy had any guts and wasn't so pretentious thinking that it would be a sin to give a ""Horror"" movie it's highest honor that year."
1.0,exorcist,The greatest film of its type
0.0,exorcist,"I don't mean to offend you guys who love this film but my opinion: this was not a good movie. Not that it was scary, it was just very peculiar. 2 out of 10 stars."

1.0,exorcist,One of the most original and scary horror films ever made. Anyone even thinking of making a horror film in the past 40 years has stolen something from this film.
1.0,exorcist,Still holds up after all theses years.
1.0,exorcist,The greatest Demonic Possession movie ever made. Top notch performances from all involved and brilliant direction at a terrifying pace.
1.0,exorcist,This is easily my favorite horror movie. I like how it spends the first half focusing on the characters and Ragens slow path to being possessed. It doesn't hold back and it throws it all. I love the characters and it's always a great treat to watch on Halloween after going out.
1.0,exorcist,"The Exorcist was the most terrifying film I have ever seen. Excellent intensity that leads to a remarkable eerie atmosphere, top-notch performance; especially by our leads. And the special effect were great, for its time. This is hands down one of the scariest film out there."
1.0,exorcist,Best movie I've ever seen
1.0,exorcist,"This movie is so cool on so many levels I dont know where to begin! To think this was made in 1973, it's like the film had supernatural powers!!!"
1.0,exorcist,"Pure mystery, pure terror, pure suspense, pure cinematic gold"
1.0,exorcist,"Greatly directed, masterfully acted, and great suspense make this one of the best horror films of all-time; for the time (1973), it was ahead of its time, making it one of the most timeless horror films to graze the screen."
1.0,exorcist,One of the best horror / suspense films of all time and is culturally significant. Initial Hollywood viewings required personnel to revive viewers with smelling-salts from passing-out due to fear (seriously).
1.0,exorcist,Best horror film of all time...period.
1.0,exorcist,The scariest movie ever made. I haven't seen a horror movie that can top it yet.

1.0,exorcist,"While some of the elements might have been lost in time to be deemed dated, The Exorcist is still an incredible atmospheric and artistic work that is as powerful today as it surely was back then."
1.0,exorcist,a drama of faith and humanity
1.0,exorcist,Scariest movie I ever saw
1.0,exorcist,A Perfect Horror. One of the best movies ever made on exorcism.
1.0,exorcist,"An exceptional film with superb acting, writing, directing, and cinematography. With no missteps and with a realistic approach to a supernatural premise, The Exorcist is an epic and ingenious classic film with one of the greatest openings in cinematic history."
1.0,exorcist,"No doubt, not only a masterwork but the greatest horror movie ever made. It's something that you'll never forget. It's immense with its fulfilling story and powerhouse acting. A disturbing exquisite work of art. It's deliciously-frightening. 'What an excellent movie for an exorcism.'"
1.0,exorcist,"This movie shows what God and Christ can do, this had my eyes glued to the screen!"
0.0,exorcist,"Perhaps the greatest mystery of this film is how it became known as ""the most frightening horror movie of all time"". An Ill conceived mess of a movie who's power to frighten lies solely in its sheer vulgarity."
1.0,exorcist,A great movie with a atmospheric front cover as the photo. I think that Mike Oldfield's Tubular Bells should be played more.
0.0,exorcist,"It sucked lol why is this considered a classic? It was just weird if anything, it wasn't scary at all."
0.0,exorcist,"Hilarious. You really must see this, if only to see how horrible it is. It's strange to think that people were once scared of this movie. It looks like a mentally challenged middle school class made it."
1.0,exorcist,This movie kicks as and basically started every horror norm we see today.
1.0,exorcist,"Using silence to generate genuine horror, ""The Exorcist"" is arguably the greatest of all scary movies; it's undeniably one of the best films of all time."
1.0,exorcist,The best horror ever! They can't ever make another. It's to bad to cause I miss them.
1.0,exorcist,"A horror film known to shock people so much that they vomited in the aisle of the theater and/or fainted. Only a movie with shock value and horror moviemaking genius can do that. Even for 1973, this movie is scary as hell!"
0.0,exorcist,Very disappointing. Maybe I shouldn't have had high expectations for a movie made over 40 years ago but so many people have told me that this movie is still scary today. I actually laughed at how bad the movie was.

1.0,exorcist,A classic that will stand the test of time. Brilliant and disturbing.
1.0,exorcist,"It reminded me a lot of Rosemary's Baby. It took it's time, it didn't feel the need to constantly be one-uping itself. It was slow at times and it dragged itself (and the suspense) out as far as it could and it worked."
0.0,exorcist,Such a confusing story. Too many loose ends. I was very disappointed.
1.0,exorcist,IT'S EXTRA SCARY!!! CHECK OUT THE EXTENDED DIRECTOR'S CUT (2000) WHICH CONTAINS THE LEGENDARY SPIDERWALK SCENE.

1.0,exorcist,A truly horrifying film.
1.0,repulsion,when a filmmaker has a voice that is undeniable..
1.0,repulsion,"Holy what the hell AMAZING! I had never seen this, just watched first time, blown away. Catherine Deneuve is outstanding. Edgy, scary, descent into madness doesn't quite do it."
1.0,repulsion,"Polanski is masterful behind the camera, especially in his use of space. It's very gutsy and how disturbing it is is evidence of just that."
1.0,repulsion,"The perfect psychological reading that is generated in 'Repulsion' captures in very minute details the terrifying process towards total madness. If the fall to psychosis was a window into damnation, Polanski captures the very near hell of visual and sonorous master-class mosaics. 99/100"
1.0,repulsion,"While not only is this film so disturbing that you will feel as if you should take a shower after you finish it, it is also unbelievably heartbreaking in a realistic perspective. Which is why I think Repulsion is one of the best horror films of all time, even if it is a different kind of horror."
1.0,repulsion,"If you don't have claustrophobia organically, you'll likely have developed it in some form after watching this one. Another hit by Polanski. Once again Art House though... Part of The Criterion Collection and on Blu-ray in the US."
1.0,repulsion,"A disturbing, claustrophobic thriller with a fantastic performance by Catherine Deneuve and eerily effective sound design and camerawork"
1.0,repulsion,I watched this based on the RT best list - it exceeded my expectations. By a wide margin. Wow.
1.0,repulsion,"I disliked the lady so much, that it was hard to watch, but it is certianly an outstanding work."
1.0,repulsion,"The gold standard of psychological terror. Just as every senior citizen should have life alert, every artsy pervert should see this film."
0.0,repulsion,"in one word, no.in one sentence, do not waste your time on this too long no point not scary suspense movie."
1.0,repulsion,A scary disturbing movie.Makes you feel like you are the woman and you're going mad
1.0,repulsion,"This is maybe the only movie that scared me. And it's weird, because it doesn't have gory imagery or something like that. This movie really plays with your mind. Everything works perfect. Watch it alone at night and have some nightmares."
1.0,repulsion,ik kak in mijn broek
1.0,repulsion,if requiem for a dream had a godfather....this would be it.
1.0,repulsion,This has always fascinated me. Catherine Deneuve is both touching and disturbing. Beautifully shot.
1.0,repulsion,I saw this in a tiny theater in New York when it first came out. It felt as if I was stuck in her bedroom during the attacks. My night terrors continue today
0.0,repulsion,WHY was this in my queue?? Is netflix messing with me?! That was an hour and 40 mins I won't get back. :-(
1.0,repulsion,A disturbing film that hollows through a world of hallucination with unsettling horror.
1.0,repulsion,"My favourite Polanski film, this nightmarish trip into isolation and madness builds up tension and atmosphere, taking its audience hostage amid the claustrophobia and terror. The final shot (the photograph of Carol) is still one of the most powerful images in film history."
1.0,repulsion,So sweaty and so beautifully unhinged one needs a shower after watching it...
1.0,repulsion,One of the greatest psychological thrillers ever and very disturbing. Catherine Deneuve makes her best performance here.
1.0,repulsion,"Building tension on quiet moments, ""Repulsion"" is a masterclass in psychological horror."
1.0,repulsion,Fantastic use of practical effects and a mesmerizing performance from Deneuve seduces the audience into a surreal cinematic labyrinth of desperation and madness.
1.0,repulsion,one of the most remarkable psychological horror movies to date.
1.0,repulsion,Spectacular! Positively my favorite movie.
1.0,repulsion,Scared the be-Jesus outta me - when that malevolent dark figure looms out of now where and attacks her repeatedly it is chilling and unnerving - this struck a chord with me...
1.0,repulsion,Repulsion is one of those unexpected gems you find! insanely great triller keeps you intrigued the whole 104 minutes and by the end will leave you speechless
0.0,repulsion,Miserable french twat goes on a mad murderous rampage and becomes so insane she irons without plugging the iron in. thoroughly dissapointing
1.0,repulsion,"One of the best, smartest, and most unique horror films ever. This is a must see."
1.0,repulsion,One of the best psychological horror films that I have ever seen. Polanski is a master of building suspense in the confines of small spaces.
1.0,repulsion,This was really something. The score. The acting. The terror. Polanski has dark sorceress powers. Completely redefines the horror movie. It's pure greatness.
1.0,repulsion,"If you have seen Black Swan and liked it, you will love this. It is even better, the original film about a schizophrenic's slow decent into madness. Absolutely astounding performance from Catherine Deneuve."
1.0,repulsion,Classic.  Catherine Deneuve is a complete stunner. Great score that fits the film perfectly by Chico Hamilton.
1.0,repulsion,Had me wincing in sheer anticipation of horror and jump out of my seat. And this was made before CGI and makeup. Roman Polanski's creepily atmospheric psychological drama about the slow descent of a girl into madness should be revered by the horror fans.
1.0,repulsion,Roman polanskis first english film follows a schizopherenic womans descent into madness and makes the audience feel as clausthrophic as the character
1.0,repulsion,We start off as innocent as the girl can be but slowly and murkily do we descend to a great pit of turmoil and disturbance. Excellent work from Polanski.
1.0,repulsion,Repulsion compels the viewer to be as claustrophobic as the paranoid lead woman as she journeys into insanity.
1.0,repulsion,Fianlly just saw this film and i'm not disappointed to movie is a masterpicie . This shows off the fPolanksis full potienal in theis surealist look in the a insaine mind. it obisouly shows its influence on directors like Lynch and Argento
1.0,repulsion,Deneuve showed that she could understand a director unlike any other actress who ever lived. Polanski's visuals and her acting make this one of the finest depictions of the descent into madness ever.
1.0,repulsion,Hands down the best Roman Polanski film in my humble opinion. And he's got a lot of good ones.
1.0,repulsion,"At first, the film exchanges excitement for eerieness, but then proceeds to capture the imagination of the viewer and keep them enthralled as Carol descends into insanity."
1.0,repulsion,a young girl loses her mind in her london apartment
1.0,repulsion,"Early Polanski. If you have seen Knife in the Water and not this, imagine a movie that has just as many emotions as knife in the water, but represented through visuals of even more horror and beauty, you get this. Polanski's first horror film and arguably his best (maybe tied with Rosemary's Baby)."
1.0,repulsion,Polanski is great and knows how to make characters!
1.0,repulsion,"Repulsion, is an emotion you certainly won't feel while watching this intense, expertly crafted masterpiece."
1.0,repulsion,"An unsettling and unfortunate story which attempts to expound a virgin's fearfull perspective on sexual relations. This, combined with elements of real physical peril and mental illness, makes for a fascinated film. Typical slow Polanski build-up and revolutionary camera work."
1.0,repulsion,"Catherine Deneuve is perfect as the disturbed, sexually repressed young french girl in Roman Polankski's masterpiece about paranoia and sexuality. Amazing."
1.0,repulsion,"Absolutely terrifying, and beautifully filmed."
1.0,repulsion,Vraiment trÃ¨s trÃ¨s bon. Catherine Deneuve est gÃ (C)niale en nÃ (C)vrosÃ (C)e-psychotique! La rÃ (C)alisation est ingÃ (C)nieuse pour l'Ã (C)poque.
1.0,repulsion,Repulsion has a mood of horror & disease that is effective & disturbing. Watching Carol break down on screen will make you squirm in your seat.
1.0,repulsion,Wow this was terrifying!
1.0,repulsion,May very well be Polanski's best film
0.0,repulsion,"Very disappointing. Pretentious piece of ""art""."
1.0,repulsion,This was made in 1965 and is still pretty impressive. The directing style is fantastic! Catherine Denevue's schizophrenia mixed in with her deep sexual impulses makes this film original and a gem.
1.0,repulsion,Very strange film about claustrophobia by roman polanski not really scary but it is a overall well done masterpiece for its time beautifully well done very thrilling movie and great screenplay co written by Polanski himself highly recommended
1.0,repulsion,Had me wincing in sheer anticipation of horror and jump out of my seat. And this was made before CGI and makeup. Roman Polanski's creepily atmospheric psychological drama about the slow descent of a girl into madness should be revered by the horror fans.
1.0,repulsion,Great rental if you can find it!!
0.0,repulsion,polanski is a child rapist
0.0,repulsion,"Perhaps this was ""substantial"" when it came out, and is a classic that people reference, but nowadays it's simply terrible. Prepare to be bored out of your mind by a character you have no reason to care about, and distracted from the suspense by over the top techniques."
1.0,repulsion,Catherine Deneuve plays Carol too well.!!. =D Polanski's camera work and the effective use of black and white throughout the film greatly enhances the mood.The ending.........
1.0,repulsion,"This film managed to really get under my skin. It gave me a serious case of the creeps, which is saying something."
1.0,repulsion,"Peli del 65, primera peli en ingles de Roman Polanski!!! que vara mas reloca!!! muy buena!"
1.0,repulsion,"Man, that was freaky."
1.0,repulsion,"I decided to give this one another chance, since I wasn't getting into it the first time around. I'm glad that I did. It's a wonderfully creepy movie."
1.0,repulsion,Absolutely terrifying.
1.0,repulsion,One of the freakiest and most disturbing movies I have ever seen.
1.0,repulsion,this movie is cold! polanksi is greatness
1.0,repulsion,This is one of the creepiest movies I have ever seen. I was as paranoid about the protagonist as I was her antagonist - loneliness. This is the kind of movie that makes you want to lock your doors and put yourself in a straitjacket.
1.0,repulsion,"Outstanding Deneuve in taut,nerve-cracking,misogyne thriller.Shall not miss it."
1.0,repulsion,"An enthralling, if not enchanting, work of art in a habitual genre to its audience at the time, but supposing that not half of the world have known yet the young talented Polanski, this film would have been his first masterpiece to reach them in a remark it would be remembered as a historical piece."
1.0,repulsion,An unquestionably perfect film.
1.0,repulsion,"The character development, the repetitions, the maddening background noises, the surreal imagery, the flawless camera direction, the empathy, the symbolism, the widening cracks..."
1.0,repulsion,This is the film Black Swan wanted to be. A flawless early effort from Roman Polanski.
1.0,repulsion,"The movie was made in 1965, though it's incorrectly dated on here as 1997. That annoyance aside, the film was genuinely terrifying and really stays with you, whether you want it too or not. Right up there with Jacob's Ladder for my all time favorite horror films."
1.0,repulsion,A disturbing film and with a great performance from Deneuve.
1.0,repulsion,"5 out of 5 - thanks to Flixter for doing everything wrong, again."
1.0,repulsion,I thought I was hearing things after watching this one.
1.0,repulsion,"Earliest proper psychological horror I've seen within the contemporary context. Highly original. However, don't bother with it if you don't like slightly low paced, black and white films."
1.0,repulsion,"One of the first Roman Polanski movies, it's a chilling masterpiece about woman's decent into madness."
1.0,repulsion,hey .... why in title is year 1997? .... It's a movie from 1965 ...
1.0,repulsion,"I don't throw around 5/5 easily, but Polanski's first English film (1965 London) is spot-on perfection. 100% on Rottentomatoes."
1.0,repulsion,"Polanski's first film of his urban terrors trilogy is efective simply because you can't never guess what is coming up next; I'm not easily impressed, but this one made me jump off my couch three times."
1.0,repulsion,"GREATTTT! film, starts out a little slow then really gets crazy. One of Polanski's ""Apartment Trilogy."" They are all good, but this one is quite insane."
1.0,repulsion,"Wierd, Yet Entertaining"
1.0,repulsion,"Haunting and claustrophobic, Repulsion places you in the room with it's disturbed protagonist, her degenerating psyche creating terrifying hallucinations, until she lashes out with violence to stop them. A classic Polanski nightmare."
1.0,repulsion,The absolute best movie I have ever seen about a woman descending into madness apart from Woman Under the Influence. I should just make a note that the criterion edition of this is MAGNIFICENT. SO CRISP & SHARP.
0.0,repulsion,"Awfully boring, then it gets annoying, and at the end a little bit interesting. Only for respect of the old perv Polanski watched till the end."
1.0,repulsion,A masterpiece from Polish master Roman Polanski. One of the most pygoloically distrubing films out there. This film is a looking into the isane and delsional mind of Carol Ledoux(played by Catherine Deneuve). Sureal and very atosphereic. This film shows that anyone can snap even you and even me.
1.0,repulsion,"Film Psychedelikohorrifique, un chef d'oeuvre noir et blanc d'une justesse et sobriété implacable et prenante."
1.0,repulsion,Repulsion is probably the best psychological thriller I've seen. A true masterpiece from a real genius Roman Polanski (Though I know he's charged with a rape case!). Don't forget lovely Catherine Deneuve:)
1.0,repulsion,"Not comfortable viewing, but for a reason. Polanski devastatingly interpets what too much isolation can do to the psyche... Draw your own conclusions."
1.0,repulsion,LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVED THIS MOVIE.
0.0,repulsion,I know I will be in the minority here but I was really dissapointed with Repulsion. Being a big Polanski fan I had been meaning to see this for some time and had high expectations. Some disturbing scenes which were good but the film just didn't seem to connect with me unlike his other works.
1.0,repulsion,Excellent... might type more laters.
1.0,repulsion,"An unsettling masterpiece, with a brilliant performance by Catherine Deneuve."
1.0,repulsion,"Absolutely horrifying. Catherine Deneuve is stunning, but I'll never be able to see her the same way again."
1.0,repulsion,"No one does a classier rape scene than Roman Polanski, The Devil and Rosemary is at the top of the list, but there were multiple ones in this so.........."
1.0,repulsion,Today's lesson: Don't leave the crazy lady alone with a straight razor.
1.0,repulsion,Disgusting. Shocking. Disturbing. Amazing.
1.0,repulsion,"The best movie Polanski has ever done, and along with The Hour of the Wolf the best paranoid movie ever."
1.0,repulsion,"This movie was a complete shock to me. I went in not expecting much, and came out hooked, compelled and excited. Barely anyone I know has seen this, but I recommend it. A slow burn that will build in tension, paranoia, and most importantly dread. Great oldie"
1.0,repulsion,"I'd have to say this is among one of my favourites now among the few really well done psychological-thrillers, such as Mulholland Dr. and Memento."
1.0,repulsion,Roman Polanski's first English language film (second overall) is perhaps the greatest psychological drama ever made. Check it out!
1.0,repulsion,Love those playful nuns out the window.
1.0,repulsion,#2 crazy chick of all-time behind Virginia in Spider Baby. Great movie!
1.0,repulsion,I love Catherine Deneuve. A great Roman Polanski film.

1.0,repulsion,"Nearly 45 years on it still hasn't lost any of its impact. The infamous decaying rabbit setpiece was swiped by Abel Ferrara in his 1979 feature ""Driller Killer""."
1.0,repulsion,I love this movie. You should see this.
1.0,repulsion,Fianlly just saw this film and i'm not disappointed to movie is a masterpicie . This shows off the fPolanksis full potienal in theis surealist look in the a insaine mind. it obisouly shows its influence on directors like Lynch and Argento
1.0,repulsion,"This movie is incredible. Beautifully shot, extremely shocking for it's time and in my opinion is the best cinematic portrayal of the progression of insanity that I have ever seen."
1.0,repulsion,"Alienation captured. We get to go into the depths of confusion. Polanski is able to strip away the veneer of civilization and manners. We see people in all of their rawness, and it isn't pretty."
1.0,repulsion,"Luultavasti jÃ?Â¤rkyttÃ?Â¤vin elokuva mitÃ?Â¤ koskaan olen nÃ?Â¤hnyt. Jumalainen Catherine Deneuve nÃ?Â¤yttelee hienosti tÃ?Â¤ssÃ?Â¤ leffassa. Edelleen pidÃ¤n tÃ¤tÃ¤ Polanskin pÃ¤Ã¤tyÃ¶nÃ¤, vaikka onhan Pianistikin hieno leffa."
1.0,repulsion,Awesome! One of my favorite Polanski films. Catherine Denevue is stuck in her apartment and just loses her shit...I can relate
1.0,repulsion,Great. Catherine Deneuve in one of her best!!
1.0,repulsion,crazy film! definitely one of the most disturbing films i've seen. this has so much more depth than your average thriller. and Catherine Deneuve gives a very powerful performance.
1.0,repulsion,Polanski at his some of his most disturbing and innovative. Objects and lighting are key in progressing the unraveling of an already head-case. The dead rabbit is the thickest layer of visual metaphor. The violence has high anticipation but shocking in its honesty.
0.0,repulsion,color me unimpressed. there's a reason polanski ain't allowed in the u.s. he's a sick *#%$er.
1.0,repulsion,"The most unnerving film I've seen. The more closely I watch it, the more signs of the girl's increasing insanity I pick up on. The most disturbing thing of all is that anyone in passing may be about to snap. Anyone. If seen in a theater you may want to lock your car door for the drive home."
1.0,repulsion,the very best film of Polanski
1.0,repulsion,PSYCHOLOGICAL TERROR FROM THE MASTER OF FORM POLANSKI. A NIGHTMARE COMES TRUE IN THIS DEEPLY FREUDIAN 60'S SLASHER. A CLASSIC

1.0,repulsion,The most horrifying movie I've ever seen
1.0,repulsion,Love this story. The plot was so captivating and it held my attention even though there was nothing remotely flashy. And Catherin Denuve is wonderful as usual
1.0,repulsion,"a work of pure artthough it is dark, it conveys so much about the stream between normal consciousness and psychosis"
1.0,repulsion,Repulsion is the first of the tenant nightmares presented by Roman Polanksi. Brilliantly constructed. One of the best horror movies. Nobody understands horror movies like Polanksi.
1.0,repulsion,Fantastic!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Polanski si great!!
1.0,repulsion,Voyage au bout de la folie et du repliement sur soi. Ou comment devenir sa propre phobie. Tres certainement le plus grand film de Polanski.
1.0,repulsion,"A really stunning, encompassing and chilling representation of a psychological split. Catherine Deneuve's performance is subtly shattering and Polanski films every moment with such eerie, deliberate grace."
1.0,repulsion,Classic suspense film is very atmospheric. Deneuve is fantastic and the film does not seem dated in the least.
1.0,repulsion,sultry psycho deneuve freaks out in swinging 60's Soho. silly rabbit!
1.0,repulsion,"I found this movie interesting. The way in which the camera moves to show the girls obsessions, fantasies and hallucinations is creative. Definatly different type of movie, for that era also. Very beyond its years."
1.0,repulsion,"Along with Eraserhead and Inland Empire, this is probably the best horror movie I've ever seen. If you are more terrified of mental illness than of men in hockey masks, this film is for you. Roman Polanski's debut feature and the introduction of Catherine Deneuve to the world. Remarkable."
1.0,repulsion,A great horror story!
1.0,repulsion,"fantastic soundtrack, great actress, breath-taking screenplay... this movie is the incarnation of misanthropy."

1.0,repulsion,My favourite Polanski. Deneuve is absolutely amazing
1.0,repulsion,A woman's descent into madness. Watch for the parallel between her sanity and the rabbit.
1.0,repulsion,We discovered this Roman Polanski movie completely by chance and it was great. It is particularly interesting to see how it approached this theme years before it became a complete cliche.
1.0,repulsion,"Wonderful piece of horror about a lonely girl who badly needs to get laid. Love the rotting meat, the flies, the cracks in the walls. There's really nothing like it. Except maybe The Tenant"
1.0,repulsion,This was...just an awesome movie. I'm glad The Cardigans' music video introduced me to it. : )
1.0,repulsion,"Great movie, 10/10 on the disturbometer."
1.0,repulsion,"The sentiment of this film is pure horror but in a beautifull way, achieved with the doubtless aesthetics of the masterfull Roman Polanski. Probably the most stylish film ever made. Note also the brilliant score composed by jazzdrummer Chico Hamilton."

1.0,repulsion,"Pure Polanski, with Catherine Deneuve going crazy! What more could you want? Her sister in the movie is her real-life sister who was sadly murdered. Isn't for the squeamish."
1.0,repulsion,Black and white creepy frenchness.
1.0,repulsion,"beautiful movie, an atmosphere that can hunt you in your dreams"
1.0,repulsion,"Truly amazing. And that's all due to the lead actress' very convincing and hauntingly realistic portrayal of a disturbed young woman, as well as Polanski's rather incredible direction . This film is pitch perfect as far as eerie or just outright frightening psychological thrillers go."
0.0,repulsion,"I barely made it passed the hour mark before I shut it off. Not because it's so ""terrifying"" and ""shocking"" as some people seem to think, but because it's horribly boring. Psychological thrillers were never really my genre anyways."
1.0,repulsion,The ultimate mindfuck.
1.0,repulsion,"When it comes to claustrophobic, paranoid horror movies, Polanski is the king and this is definitely the best."
1.0,repulsion,Fantastic film full of tension and unease with the fabulous Catherine Deneuve.
1.0,repulsion,A disturbing film but Catherine Deneuve is perfect and Polanski did a great job with a difficult subject!
1.0,repulsion,"An intense portrayal of a woman losing her grip on reality. Fantastic direction, and Deneuve is enthralling."
1.0,repulsion,"Mitähän kaikkea voi liikkua yksinäisen, päästään lahon naisen mielessä? Polanski ohjaa ja Deneuve tekee toisen elämänsä suurista rooleista. Taustalla kuuskytluvun Lontoon svengaa erityisen nätisti."
1.0,repulsion,"One of Polanski's best, a disturbing portrait of repression and madness. Great hallucination sequences."
1.0,repulsion,Polanski's finest hour.
1.0,repulsion,bleak creepy madness
1.0,repulsion,"Great, dark, atmospheric, shocking Polanski film; black and white, stark background music, and surreal nightmarish images make for a good time!"

1.0,repulsion,"I was lucky enough to see in on the big screen in Kensington where it was filmed. AMAZING atmosphere, great acting and masterful direction. A chef d'oeuvre i my opinion"
1.0,repulsion,"At first, I thought this was slow and tedious, but I soon realized the genius that was behind it. There is some much in this movie that can not all be captured it one viewing. This turned out to be a very effective horror with direction that creates very real and stark imagery."
1.0,repulsion,Polanski knows his crazy. This shit is nuts
1.0,repulsion,Deneuve is beautiful and creepy at once. And the direction is fantastic. A viscerally disturbing movie.
1.0,repulsion,the inspiration for my short film leave a message
0.0,repulsion,It's the 70's through and through. For me that is usually enough. Boring.
1.0,repulsion,"One of my top ten favorites. Polanski at his best. What happens when a girl's afraid of sex? Dead rabbits show up and hands come out of the wall, obviously."
1.0,repulsion,This is a very good movie that no one remembers any more. Just look at the camera. A psychological thriller were the camera is the main character. The soul of a sick girl is revealed through the lens.
1.0,repulsion,Extremely creepy. The destruction of Carol's apartment and mind are wonderfully depicted by Polanski.
1.0,repulsion,Changed my life when I was 18
1.0,repulsion,"Absolutely fascinating and brilliant. Polanski is just the most brilliant director in these kinds of psychological horror, extremely disturbing and just brilliant."
1.0,repulsion,Better with every viewing.
1.0,repulsion,This movie is hell.. so brilliant ... remind me of Polanski's The Tenant... but Repulsion is much better....Catherine Deneuve is funtastic..

1.0,repulsion,"Polanski's finest achivement. A tail of sexual repression/repulsion and psychological illnes set against the scenary of ""swinging London"". Surreal is the main keyword for this classic."
1.0,repulsion,Astounding. Truly revolutionary. This movie changed cinema forever.
1.0,repulsion,"You need patience to see this movie. It seems slow at first, but what it builds up to is intense and disturbing...in a tasteful way, of course, which is what makes it so amazing."
1.0,repulsion,"Probably the only horror movie in the world with a groovy jazz soundtrack. Scary, nevertheless."
1.0,repulsion,"Another frightening, psychological masterpiece from Polanski. Its haunting, well crafted, briliantly acted."
1.0,repulsion,"I don't know what to say about this movie? The movie left me with my mouth open and speechless. If your a woman I'm sure you can relate with the main character and her discuss toward men, but never take it as far as she did. I definitely recommend it, Polanski is a deranged man!"
1.0,repulsion,Polanski at his best.Catherine Deneuve is wonderful

1.0,1002448-birds,"The Birds: Hitchcock expertly builds suspence in this underated masterpeice. While expertly crafting its characters, villans and story."
1.0,1002448-birds,A classic Hitchcock flick that builds up with a long but good story and plenty of thrills. That also shines in its own right even if it is somewhat lower than his other films.
1.0,1002448-birds,The final masterpiece by Hitchcock. Hitch should've retired after finishing this one.
1.0,1002448-birds,Hitchcock does it again! One of horror cinema's finest!
1.0,1002448-birds,An obvious must-see. Still creepy to this day.
1.0,1002448-birds,"10 out of 10:Thanks to incredible special effects, acting, and directing, The Birds makes innocent animals into terrifying ones."
1.0,1002448-birds,I forgive the terrible graphics - Hitchcock's one detour into the supernatural is a fun side-trip.
0.0,1002448-birds,"Oh my gosh, how is this pile of garbage a classic. the visual effects suck, the movie isn't scary in any way, the acting is horrific, and the movie just sucks. The Birds made me laugh my head off, for that it gets more than half a star."
1.0,1002448-birds,One of my favorite movies. Still creepy and unnerving. Still a interesting and unique movie plots.
0.0,1002448-birds,It seems the plot was written by a hen and directed by Hitch'cock'.

1.0,1002448-birds,"The special effects don't hold up well, but they don't have to in order to scare the audience. If the merits of Hitchcock's films are based on his mastery of suspense, then this may be his greatest work ever."
1.0,1002448-birds,Mr. Hitchcock demonstrates he is ever the master of suspense while magnificently depicting birds as some of the scariest horror movie villains ever filmed.
1.0,1002448-birds,A movie to this day that can keep you on the edge of your seat. Birds is a classic suspense movie that has you locked into watching and wanting more.
1.0,1002448-birds,"first film I've watched. I was 7, and it changed my life--look, I'm making films now"
1.0,1002448-birds,Very Good Movie Best Horror Movie Ever Made in My Opinion
1.0,1002448-birds,Arguably my favourite Hitchcock film.
1.0,1002448-birds,"There are some truly scary scenes in here, despite the ending that will frustrate any viewer in perpetuity. Full review later."
1.0,1002448-birds,"Absolutely terrifying. There is nothing corny about these birds, in a horror film layered with a sly romance and an ambiguous ending that wraps up the character arcs but leaves you wondering if anyone is actually going to survive long enough to enjoy their newfound relationships."
1.0,1002448-birds,"Scary and Frightening, but I like it."
1.0,1002448-birds,Great movie that has aged well. Hitch is still better than most of our modern directors.

1.0,1002448-birds,One Of The Best Alfred Hitchcock Films Of All Time! It Good In Pretty Much All Aspects. My Favorite Scene Was The Gas Station Scene Quite Awesome.
1.0,1002448-birds,If a movie was made today about killer birds attacking a community due to two love birds being in a cage it would be laughed at.Its Hitchcock...simple.
1.0,1002448-birds,"""The Birds"" is...awesome-tacular. It has great acting, a great script and campy special effects. It's kinda silly though."
1.0,1002448-birds,Awesome...watching right now!
1.0,1002448-birds,Movies that are fiction but could be a reality have me freaked. Just like that movie Willard the rat king.

1.0,1002448-birds,What I really like of this film is The End
1.0,1002448-birds,"There has been a debate whether this was as good as ""Psycho"" but in my mind whilst not as good it's still a classic in its own right with the vintage tension he always brings to the table and flawlessly written"
1.0,1002448-birds,"The reason I am still afraid of birds today! A must see for all, Hitchcock at his best!"
1.0,1002448-birds,This film is less about demon devil birds swooping out of the sky and more about the psychological panic that spreads through the town-and further. I really like the meticulous nature of Hitchcock and this film does not disappoint.

1.0,1002448-birds,a marvelous movie about nature taking on human kind...

0.0,chronicle,"the numerous scenes filmed with a camcorder are a major distraction, and the plot- 3 boys gain special powers and end up in a marvel comic battle between good (one boy) and Evil(another boy) is overly violent and not very creative."
0.0,chronicle,One of the WORST movies that I've EVER seen.
1.0,chronicle,"This movie was very suspenseful and is currently my favourite movie. Usually, found footage films aren't very good, but there are those few that I love."

1.0,chronicle,"A peace of art. Camera is sensational, story is awsome. Everything from the begining to the end is perfect."
1.0,chronicle,"It has a strong theme about child abuse. But also has good performances and great visuals, and Josh Trank the producer of ""Big Fan"" has made a good found-footage film."
1.0,chronicle,Wow that was a trip and a half of a movie awesome Visual effects are so good and real They should do a Super Hero movie or Akira it will be so well done You have to watch this
1.0,chronicle,"Dark, sinister, and extremely grim, Chronicle is a rare origin story where it is focused entirely on the origin of the super villain rather than the actual hero."
1.0,chronicle,Dark and more realistic than any other superhero movie.
1.0,chronicle,Great character development throughout as well as great acting.
1.0,chronicle,Great movie. I loved it.

1.0,chronicle,"It's the best found-footage movie to this day. Each character is well-written and interesting, the premise is unbelievably fun, the effects are stunning, and the ending is oddly chilling. Also, it exudes the realism that most movies of this genre lack."
1.0,chronicle,"Algo que amé de esta cinta es que es cero pretenciosa y lejos de ser una cinta que buscara volver heroes a sus protagonistas, los vuelve lo que son: unos adolescentes que no saben qué hacer cuando tienen el poder en sus manos y se les sale de control."
1.0,chronicle,A crazy thriller with amazing effects. Found footage films get more thrills and scares. And this delivers them.
1.0,chronicle,a nerd that gets hit by hi dad goes to a party with his cousin and friend then gets super powers
1.0,chronicle,This film surprised me in so many ways. The acting was phenomenal and the story and action were wicked. The film was well directed and the comedic scenes were well done. Although some of the special effects could have been better computerised.

1.0,chronicle,This Found-Footage film does something that many films now-a-days are unable to do. This film draws the viewer into the movie throughout multiple schemes. The trailer downplayed how good the movie was.

0.0,donnie_darko_the_directors_cut,Destroyed the original feeling. The original takes you along for the ride. allows you to share your own feelings and experiences as the movie progresses.

1.0,the_orphanage,"Super soulful, intelligent, powerful. This is one of the movies where you think it is a terror, but actually ends up being a thriller in which it has an ending that oppresses the heart of anyone. Belen Rueda's performance was very good and outstanding leadership."
1.0,the_orphanage,"There is more in this film than I had expected when I first saw the trailer. A mother was looking for her missing son, and by that, she discovered more about the past."

1.0,the_orphanage,Hands down the best horror film of the decade.
1.0,the_orphanage,Pure cinema art. Could not believe how a horror film made me feel this way. Excellently well written. Every movie is all about human's heart. But this one's conclusion is daring but yet beautiful.

1.0,the_orphanage,"A masterpiece, a gripping story that goes off in a shocking twisty direction, the atmosphere is haunting and the emotion resonant. You need only watch this film once and it will remain forever with you but chances are you'll want to revisit it."
1.0,the_orphanage,El Orfanato is so cleverly written and directed that it is both spooky and touching. It reaches many areas of your mind and yet is simple to follow. Absolutely stunning work and beautifully acted.

0.0,the_orphanage,"Hailed as a masterpiece, when in reality all it is ia a plod along, predictable ghost story which is less scary than an evening in Tom's Midnight Garden."

1.0,the_orphanage,A truly scary horror film with a heart.
1.0,the_orphanage,"I love it. It is not that scary but it shows thrill and adventure as the story goes on. It has a riveting plot and an unexpexted ending though I saw that ending in a film entitled St. Ange., but this was far more better!!!"
1.0,the_orphanage,"one of the best thrillers i've ever seen - it's really difficult for horror movies to maintain standards of high filmmaking, but this film inexplicably does it! the content speaks for itself."
1.0,the_orphanage,"great film, it was a spanish film, I own it on DVD, it was a great film, it was a great spanish film, I loved it, great film, it starred Geraldine Chaplin, Belén Rueda, Fernando Cayo and Roger Príncep"

1.0,the_orphanage,"No bargain-basement Hollywood thrills here - just a beautifully filmed ghost story whose originality will startle, absorb and sadden you...a pleasurable time for all horror fans, excelente!"
1.0,the_orphanage,One of my favorite films. It plays on the detraction to deformity most people are disgusted and enthralled by. A good movie that will break your heart instead of the scare you expected.
1.0,the_orphanage,LA ULTIMA GRAN PELICULA D NUESTRA GENERACION DE FANTASMA Y SUSPENSO
1.0,the_orphanage,this film put me on the edge of my seat. took my breath away. thrilled me. etc... Guillermo Del Toro is a legend.
1.0,the_orphanage,"This is how horror/suspense movies should be done. I pretty much love anything Del Toro does, and this is no exception. The basic story is simple, but unlike most simply designed story lines, I did not see the end coming."
1.0,the_orphanage,"Beautiful, haunting story that takes a bit of inspiration from Peter Pan and a lot of inspiration from the old game Hide and Seek. There are amazing, innovative some scenes and perspectives here. I would watch it again, and again, and again."

1.0,the_orphanage,An awesome psychological thriller!

0.0,cronos,"Me aburrió demasiado, no la terminé de ver. al final el viejo se muere."
1.0,cronos,awesome directorial debut of one of my fave working directors today-Guillermo Del Toro
1.0,cronos,I truly regret not having seen this film until now! It is a remarkable film from a truly gifted writer and director!
1.0,cronos,"I consider this the precursor and grand daddy film to Let Me In. Very unique vampire flick, words can't describe it."
1.0,cronos,"Guillermo del Toro has given a crazy and weird twist to the classic vampire tale, it is not only gory, thrilling and charming, but original and creepy as well, now we learn that to achieve eternal life there's always a sacrifice."
1.0,cronos,Still del Toro's finest film. Marvelously creepy with a terrific performance by the great Federico Luppi who was just at that point transitioning from being a director in Argentina to an actor in Spain with a stopover in Mexico for this gem.
1.0,cronos,"A horribly stunning film from Guillermo del Toro. If you're a fan of gothic horror stories, you'll love Cronos. The cast is wonderful, particularly Ron Perlman as Angel, who has a fascination with rhinoplasty."
0.0,cronos,"I have no idea what appeal this movie has to receive such praise. I found it very very mediocre and a real ""B movie""... But not in the good way"
1.0,cronos,Guillermo del Toro is a GENIUS!
0.0,cronos,"Del Toro has lots of talent as a director, but his debut picture is pretty bad. Strong performances from much of the cast are the only things worth praising. The second act seems to fly by without anything happening, whereas the finale drags on for what seems like an eternity."
0.0,cronos,"To say i was dissapointed after watching this is an understatement. I was told this was gory, and it was a horror. Sadly it was neither, it was just a really slow pathetic boring film. A complete waste of time.Nothing ever really happens its just shockingly dull."
1.0,cronos,A true vampire film!
1.0,cronos,"Not the best plot ever, but a piece of work indeed"
1.0,cronos,"I thought this would be a normal vampire film from the start, but it evolved into something I never expected, and I was almost driven to tears by the finale."

1.0,cronos,Would you live forever if you could?
1.0,cronos,"This early horror film from Del Toro is haunting and atmospheric, and full of extremely memorable characters (hell, I could watch 90 minutes of just the mortician)."
1.0,cronos,An amazing debut from del Toro. A genre bending film that is a pleasure to watch.
1.0,cronos,A creepy and morbid tale of one man consumed by a unnatural urge that slowly drains all soul while keeping his body living but not really alive - a must see for a totally original and unique take on the vampire genre.
1.0,cronos,"Dazzling,bizarre outlook to vampirysm. Indispensable."
0.0,cronos,"Granted I only paid £3 for the DVD but that money would have been better spent in a wishing well. Del Toro became better as time went on but this was just the biggest pile of warm turd. Don't bother, stick pins in your eyes if you really fancy a thrill."
1.0,cronos,This film changed the way i look at movies...amazing flick.
0.0,cronos,"Ron Perlman is great as usual, but the movie is crap."
1.0,cronos,"A marvellous retelling of the vampire tale. Very original and dark. The cast is perfect and Perlman, as always, shines through. Del Toro, a true master of the paranormal, shows his capabilities in this, his first cinematic release, and still among his finest"

1.0,cronos,Guillermo del Toro puts an interesting spin on the vampire film.
0.0,cronos,Wank. Del Toro sucks.

0.0,cronos,"This was, in one word: bollocks! Sometimes these so called reviewers annoy me with words like: mini-masterpeice, best chiller in decades!. Plain and simple it was rubbish."
1.0,cronos,The first movie that I saw from Guillermo del Toro and certainly not the last.
1.0,cronos,Guillermo del Toro. What a masterful storyteller. If you loved Pan's Labyrinth you'll love this too.
1.0,cronos,"Brilliant twist on a vampire style tale. Moral, religious and slightly sad. Managed to watch this in Cardiff Chapter Theatre with Alex Cox doing a MovieDrome presentation at the start."
1.0,cronos,"excelente historia de ficción , mexicana y bien desarrollada...te pone a pensar sobre la existencia"
1.0,cronos,"one of the best vampire films ever. Del Torro's frist outing and already it looks brilliant, the script is occasionally a bit thin, but Ron Pearlman as the 'heavy' in that suit is amazing!"
1.0,cronos,Esto si es cine de terror mexicano ;)
1.0,cronos,This is one of my favourite movies. Guillermo Del Toro is a fantastic director.
1.0,cronos,"One of Guillermo Del Toro's finest! Don't let the cheesy cover sway you, the imagery in this movie is amazing. Not to mention a wonderful performance by Federico Luppi."
1.0,cronos,Del Toro takes the classic story and rewrites it to stunnig effect in his first big one. A great taste of the wonderfull things to come. Truely original in the same breath as the classic ghost story Devils Backbone.

1.0,cronos,"If you haven't seen this get down the shops now, if you are only familiar with Guillermo del Toro's hollywood fodder such as blade 2 and Hellboy then dig into his back catalouge and watch this gem. This is where Pan's Labyrith comes from...see also devils backbone."
1.0,cronos,Amazing reinvention of vampire movies. Del Toro really strikes to the soul with plausable ideals rather than cheesy superstition and bad effects. The true core of the movie relies on the relationship between a grandfather and granddaughter which becomes very heartwarming.
1.0,cronos,"A very unknown classic horror movie, absolutely perfect."
1.0,cronos,One of my new favourite movies! Mr. del Toro is a suberb director
1.0,cronos,"Confession: I prefer this to Pan's Labyrinth. Not that PR isn't amazing, but this was the first Del Toro film to really knock me off my arse, and it's a very emotional experience watching it for me, especially the final ""fade to white"". Cool score too."
1.0,cronos,One of the finest debuts I have ever seen. A unique and brilliant spin on the vampire mythos.
1.0,cronos,Same director as Hellboy cept' he has stayed true to his mexican roots. Awesome! They dont make horror like this no more.
1.0,cronos,I love what del Torro did with the vampire theme in this film. Check it out!! I'm also a big fan of family films and the relationship between the grandfather and grandson is touching- it's also what makes the movie.
1.0,cronos,"Del Toro's back-in-the-day masterpiece! Amazing science-fiction film with an incredible screenplay and totally weird and unique in mexican filmmaking. No difference between this one and ""Pan's Labyrinth"" but a couple of years of maturing as an artist and a dollar or two hahaha Great! GREAT! GREAT!!"

1.0,1021244-thing,"Not only that The Thing is chilling and scary, but it is also the most messed up horror film I have seen since The Shining."
1.0,1021244-thing,"Finally saw the whole thing courtesy of the great Museum of the Moving Image. What a classic! Just see it once on the big screen and trust me, you'll love it and you'll miss the tough guy Kurt Russell. Where the hell did he vanish? What a loss!"
1.0,1021244-thing,so much better than the new one
1.0,1021244-thing,Best remake ever made. Great work by whoever did the make-up and special effects.
1.0,1021244-thing,"Slow, bleak, phenomenal."
1.0,1021244-thing,The Thing is absolutely cerebral and grisly.
1.0,1021244-thing,"My favorite Kurt Russell movie (Obviously). The characters are so well defined. I loved how Kurt's character MacCready is no leader in the beginning, but takes over as things grow more dire. ...and of course there is the beard. The Beard!"
1.0,1021244-thing,"Another one of John Carpenter's best films he did since ""Halloween"" (1978)."
1.0,1021244-thing,"is it among the greatest films of all-time? it gets within' shooting distance, among the greatest pure horror films of all-time? no.....IT IS THE GREATEST HORROR FILM OF ALL-TIME"

1.0,1021244-thing,"after repeated viewings, i have no choice but to give this a perfect score. remarkable special effects and a great ending make this one of my top 3 favorite horror movies of all time. could be #1."
1.0,1021244-thing,"John Carpenter's crowning achievement in my opinion. A desolate, moody, claustrophobic horror freak show with probably the most stunning and disturbing practical effects ever captured on film. It goes without saying that this is the best remake ever. Right next to Cronenberg's The Fly."
1.0,1021244-thing,"Fantastic film, poor Dogs."
1.0,1021244-thing,a classic horror movie
1.0,1021244-thing,"i just watched this and it was perfect. John Carpenter and Kurt Russel rock, they also teamed in ""Big Trouble And Little China"". perfect performances and plot, and the suspense was great id recommend this but it is a little gross and the beginnings bad for animal loves."
1.0,1021244-thing,"In the vein of Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" and later James Cameron's ""Aliens"", John Carpenter's ""The Thing"" might just represent the magnum opus in science fiction terror. At the very least, it gives the aforementioned titles a run for their money."
1.0,1021244-thing,"Best film of all time (according to my subjective view haha) - screenplay, cinematography, and direction... and the creature FX by Rick Baker are PHENOMENAL."
1.0,1021244-thing,"Quite possibly one of the most terrifying horror movies, even after thirty years. Its relentless assault of paranoia and overtones of cabin fever in the most isolated region on the planet with a parasitic organism will leave you wondering who's really human, all the way until the end."
1.0,1021244-thing,One of my all time favorite movies. It is extremely difficult to portray paranoia on film as well as The Thing does.
1.0,1021244-thing,The effects were phenomenal for being shot in the 1980's. I was glued to the screen from the moment it started. Great film for horror film fanatics! Two thumbs up!

0.0,1020662-suspiria,"Picture quality aside, this movie is a complete disaster. The storyline drags on and on, the acting is so bad that it isn't even funny, and even the (bright red) blood looks fake. The only creepy part is the soundtrack."
1.0,1020662-suspiria,"Classic Giallo Horror from the minds of Dario Argento and Daria Nicolodi. Grew up watching this movie, so I'll always love the beautiful visuals, set design and amazingly creepy score by Goblin."
1.0,1020662-suspiria,"This is simply one of my favorite movies of all time. The visuals and soundtrack are outstanding. It is not a movie for everyone. It is ridiculously bloody and the plot is almost incomprehensible. Howevery, the cinematography is a crimson beauty."
1.0,1020662-suspiria,"One of the purest horrors of all time. From the occult soundtrack by Goblin, to the color-contrast show pulled out by Argento. Witchcraft tunneling in the walls, pouring out chants of brutal murder."
1.0,1020662-suspiria,"'Suspiria' is both a horror masterpiece and a stylistic calling card for Dario Argento. The vibrant colors and dreamlike atmosphere create a cinematic experience that is unlike any other, and there's more than enough blood to go around."
1.0,1020662-suspiria,"The movie that contends the honor of being Argento's best movie along with Deep Red, Suspiria shows what the italian director is best at, attention for the detail, lighting and colors. And splatter, of course. This movie feels like a visionary dream."
1.0,1020662-suspiria,"As a horror movie this has no peers. I'd give it 6 stars if I could, but 5 will have to suffice."

1.0,1020662-suspiria,The Citizen Kane of Italian Horror. Epic in its beauty and operatic in its story of a Dance Academy in Germany with a dark secret. Features spectacular scenes of murder and death. The first of what would be The 3 Mother's Trilogy and the best.

1.0,1020662-suspiria,One of the greatest (horror) movies of all time!
1.0,1020662-suspiria,If you've never seen Suspiria and you like horror films then get on it.
1.0,1020662-suspiria,Great horror movie. They don't often make horror movies this brutal even today. The Goblin's soudntrack only enhances the beatuiful and terrifically effective atmosphere. no doubt one of Argento's greatest. Its Snow White on an acid trip.
1.0,1020662-suspiria,"A rockin' soundtrack, trippy visuals, and an all around creepy atmosphere with some scary scenes makes for a horror movie better than anything we're getting these days."

1.0,1020662-suspiria,"Ingenious yet ludicrous, dazzling but confounding, Suspira is an abnormal assault on the senses. Arguably the best snippet of Argento's inconsistent creative output, it's truly one of the best examples of style over content within the genre."
1.0,1020662-suspiria,This is my all time favorite horror movie. Nuff said.
1.0,1020662-suspiria,A true work of horrific art. It's all atmosphere and colour and sound.

1.0,1020662-suspiria,"The grand daddy of all modern-day horror films, Suspiria stands the test of time. Not only did this movie revolutionize the horror genre entirely, its brightly colored blood and plethora of colored lights can be seen in almost every Quentin Tarantino and Tim Burton film."
1.0,1020662-suspiria,"While I was not as frightened as I was during ""Deep Red"" this Argento film is visually overwhelming. The contrast of blue and red, the use of shades and shadow, the score, and vivid color is a feast for the senses."
1.0,1020662-suspiria,Scary as hell! This movie is a nightmare put to celluloid.

1.0,1020662-suspiria,"Probably one the greatest and most original horror movies ever made, there really hasn't been anything made like ""Suspiria"". Dario Argento creates a world so visually terrifying with lighting, costume and setting that the actual killing and gore come in second."
1.0,1020662-suspiria,"Suspiria is a genuinely scary and tense film. Most horror films are not at all scary and are quite laughable . The death scenes are gory and had me in a state of shock. visually stunning and gripping throughout, recommend"

1.0,1020662-suspiria,"What Dario Argento's 'Suspiria' might lack in continuity it more than makes up for with it's fantastic score by Goblin, it's wonderful cinematography, and it's amazing use of lighting. A perfect example of a beautiful horror film."

1.0,1020662-suspiria,I scared the willies out of me - which is saying something. Some of Argento's work leaves me a bit cold for all that it might be interesting. This fairly naive stuff on the face off it but actually rather twisted.

0.0,the_witch_2016,Lame. I cannot believe this got 91% it should have started at the end with the witching and been more involved that way. Overall boring and not at all scary or even thought provoking.
1.0,the_witch_2016,"I'm not going to harp on this,,but this is one of the best horror movies I've seen in my 52 years. If you are a 1 star rater, maybe you need to re evaluate the way you judge movies."

1.0,the_witch_2016,"The witch is visually appealing, thought provoking, and horrifying all at the same time. It's hard for horror films these days to genuinely scare me but this one did it. I think that this is one of the greatest horror films of all time."

0.0,the_witch_2016,"I appreciate this movie for its attempt at historical accuracy and its interesting mythology. That being said, I hated it. It was awful to watch. I could hardly understand what the characters were saying, and I donâ(TM)t particularly enjoy watching children die."

0.0,the_witch_2016,No horror at all. It's more a witch-themed drama with bad dialogues and story

0.0,the_witch_2016,Made well but 0 plot and awful kids
1.0,the_witch_2016,"The Witch represents the utterly ridiculous notion of religion. No matter how much you beg and plead this ""diety"" to help you, your calls go unanswered.

1.0,the_witch_2016,Was worth the 10 bucks for the reactions of the people in the theater alone who expected a crappy jump scare horror movie. Great at building atmosphere and tension
1.0,the_witch_2016,"The feeling of total isolation throughout the movie helps give this chilling tale of escalating horror a true sense of despair. From solid performances to beautiful cinematography, The Witch is a well-executed, cerebral film guaranteed to frighten viewers."

0.0,the_witch_2016,This movie was a snooze fest. Parts of it would start as something interesting and then wouldn't play out. In the end it was just a bunch of sobbing and inept characters.

1.0,1000617-aliens,One of the greatest films of all time.
1.0,1000617-aliens,Awesome sci fi horror movie!
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Aliens is one of the rare sequels that is even better than the original. By taking everything such as the masterful execution of suspense and character development, Aliens transcends being just a horror thriller but also a great action and drama movie as well."
0.0,1000617-aliens,"This is a very hard movie to get through, reminded me a lot of Avatar. How can this be that big a drop in quality from the original."
1.0,1000617-aliens,A great sequel to a ground breaking film! Riply is the most bad ass chick to ever hit the movie screen and she does not even mean to be bad ass either. The alien is one of the most unique creatures ever created.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Better than the original. Filled with more action than the first and somehow builds on an even better atmospheric story, and still has the same amazing effects as it's predecessor. Well James Cameron, I will accept you for some movies, and this shall be one of the movies."
1.0,1000617-aliens,best overall of the series.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"James Cameron is my favorite director, and possibly the best director of the 20th century. The detail he puts in this movie goes without saying."

1.0,1000617-aliens,"This is an outstanding movie. Moving, action packed and fast paced."
1.0,1000617-aliens,One of the best films I have ever seen. Loved every second of it.
1.0,1000617-aliens,It's some of the same formula from the last movie but comes off fresh with a new cast of more fleshed out characters (except ripely). Debatably this is a better sequel but it's unfair to compare the two because they are different genres but they are both fantastic movies.
1.0,1000617-aliens,The rise of Bill Paxton.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Excellent movie. For it's time it did exceptionally well with effect. Aliens used no CGI effect, it was all puppets and costumes - genius"
1.0,1000617-aliens,One of the best sequels ever made and a sci-fi horror action classic
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Thrilling roller coaster of a film that has a little bit of everything...sci-fi, horror action, gore...you name it, it's got it all tied up in a nice, tight package. Great acting, wild effects and great direction help make this the true classic it's become."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Once again,the even better sequel Aliens,gives us what made its original great ,and adding more with its colonial marines,strong performances,action packed,with its non-forgettable quote ""Its game over man,game over!"",and the weapons make this sequel worth the while to watch."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"A full blown science fiction classic. It was as great (albeit starkly different) as the first and far better than the rest in the series. The atmospheric tension, and surprisingly good acting made this film a roller coaster ride of thrills, kills, and big black aliens."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Faster paced than the first, but just as good. ""Aliens"" is once again a superb entry in the genre."
0.0,1000617-aliens,-: that fucking little girl...opposite of plot driven story telling. Everything seems so predictable and unnatural.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Game over man, Game over"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"while Alien was a masterpiece of a horror/ sci-fi film, Aliens was a masterpiece of an action/ sci-fi film. easily the best action movie ever made, with an original story that has been duplicated many times *cough* Halo *cough*"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"While ""Alien"" is a fantastic Sci-Fi Horror film, ""Aliens"" is a fantastic Sci-Fi Action film with horror elements. It's well directed, superbly acted, and more memorable than the original. Oh, and the Colonial Marines, really awesome!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"American classic enough said, but really what else is their to say about Aliens"
1.0,1000617-aliens,James Cameron not only reinvented the scifi horror of Alien but turned it into a heart stopping military action film with some of the most lovable soldiers ever put to film.

1.0,1000617-aliens,"Truthfully, one of the best movies I've seen and arguably one of the best movies of its decade, while the killer performance Sigoueney Weaver blew me out of my socks, the plot development with the suspense mixed in, makes me say 5 stars!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Possibly the best movie ever made, in my opinion. For a movie from the 80's, this one had it all: actors, crew, effects, plot, action. Everything."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"The zenith of sci-fi films. Weaver eclipses her role once again, as Cameron takes the reigns in a more intense action directing with memorable moments and relatable characters."

1.0,1000617-aliens,"While not only scary, it's well written, perfectly action packed, phenomenally acted especially by Sigourney Weaver, and like it's predecessor, creative in terms of set design. Aliens stands very tall within the sci-fi film pantheon."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"In my all time top 5. Michael Biehn's ""Hicks"" character is right at the top of my all time favorite characters as well as performances. The movie holds up so well almost thirty years after it's release. Genius cinema."

1.0,1000617-aliens,This movie is a great action movie. Classic. Love it! James Cameron's best work.
1.0,1000617-aliens,5/5 * An extremly effective action horror thriller that surpasses the original in some respects presenting the main lead as a horror iconic hero with visceral and emotional fury.

1.0,1000617-aliens,Classic. Badass female character taking on monsters. Intense and entertaining. Loved it.
1.0,1000617-aliens,Aliens throws intense action sequences into the mix and still retains much of the terror and horror from it's predecessor and both are surprisingly blended together magnificently. Aliens is a great sequel and an equally great movie.

1.0,1000617-aliens,My favorite film of all time...
1.0,1000617-aliens,Still one of the best if not THE best alien movie of all time.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"One of the most suspensful movies I've seen in my life; literally on the edge of my seat/yelling at the TV the entire movie. Great performance from Sigourny Weaver and easily the best in the series, took what was great about the first and improved on it!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Probably equal to the original, Aliens is an incredibly well done and entertaining action-horror film with a smart script and great performances."
1.0,1000617-aliens,Possibly the greatest film ever made. Superb!
1.0,1000617-aliens,"There are two kinds of people in the world; people who prefer the movie Alien to Aliens and people who prefer the movie Aliens to Alien. And you can't go wrong with that. Just add a lot of cool action and suspense, with a plural to make an awesome sequel."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Awesome movie. Very tense, very suspenseful, very action-packed, with an excellent performance from Weaver."
1.0,1000617-aliens,One James Cameron's best films and the best film in the alien saga Aliens is one of many sequels that is better than the first and the big difference is that this film is action packed.
1.0,1000617-aliens,One of my all time favorite movies! A must see for any horror fan!
1.0,1000617-aliens,By far the best of the Alien movies. Sigourney Weaver comes back from the first film with a powerful persona while still having a maternal sense about her when it comes to dealing with her crew and the little girl.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Next to Terminator 2, this just might be the best sequel ever made!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"New direction, huge amount of aliens coming at the same time, makes this movie great entertainment movie.And James' direction, strong script, and Sigourney's acting, this movie also succeeded to be great drama."
1.0,1000617-aliens,Brilliant from start to finish. An all time favourite
1.0,1000617-aliens,In space no-one can hear you scream. In the movie theatre everyone will. I think this is the best in the series as seeing so many aliens then the queen is such a thrilling concept. Even better on blu-ray with the inclusion of MUTHUR mode.
1.0,1000617-aliens,All you need in a movie.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"In drastic contrast to the classic original, Aliens is classic in its own way. And by that I mean this is an action packed, extremely tense, and awesome film!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,One of the most suspenseful films I've seen in quite some time.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"a sequel that actually develops the ideas from the first movie and doesn't just try to copy it. Cameron has made a few good films, this remains his greatest."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"best action movie ever made, and awsome effects. and the directing is great. but the girl so annoying when she screams but I would be screaming to if there was a alien in front of me lol"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Whereas 'Alien' was one of the best horror films ever, 'Aliens' is one of the best action movies ever made. With a terrific lead heroine, a great cast of memorable characters, and some excellent effects/action sequences, this is easily one of the best sequels ever made."
1.0,1000617-aliens,The Best Alien movie of all time.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Aliens is the epitome of what a sci-fi/action blockbuster should look, sound and feel like."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"What happens when you make a sequel to a highly praised film by completely changing the director and genre? You get Aliens, a visually incredible film, with a faster pace, more focus on war and action and one of the most memorable finales in any film."

1.0,1000617-aliens,The best of the franchise!!!

1.0,1000617-aliens,"Normally I don't care for sequels but this movie is marvelously done, allowing Ripley's character to grow and expanding the series into the action genre."
1.0,1000617-aliens,Timeless Science Fiction masterpiece!
1.0,1000617-aliens,"One of my all time fave movies!! Signory weaver? check!,humanoids? check!,colonial marines? check! lots of awesome looking aliens? Check! this is an all action packed scare fest at its best one of the best sequels to a movie ever!"

1.0,1000617-aliens,Better than the first (Alien).
1.0,1000617-aliens,"I think people don't understand how much this movie influenced media now watching it 23 years after it released. It created the survival horror scenario seen in every movie and video game that game after it. Shear perfect tension, horror, and action. It is only bested by it's original."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"One of the best Sci-fi movies of all time! James Cameron as always turns the movies he directs into cinema gold. Everything and everyone that helped produce, star and create this movie deserves a full A+ rating. They dont make movies like this anymore!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,Hands down the BEST science-fiction action film of the 20th century. AMAZING VISUALS and TERRIFIC PERFORMANCES as well as CREEPY SUSPENSE MASTERY elevates James Cameron to the top of my (and I'm sure everybody else's) list of top notch directors.
1.0,1000617-aliens,its just perfect and brilliant. I'm at >150 viewings.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Even better than the first film, with so much action and fast-paced horror that your heart might skip a beat."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Brilliant film and the the best Cameron has directed thus far (with Terminator 2). This is the perfect accompanying movie alongside a lamb jalfrezi, special rice, naan and bombay potatoes"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"""Game over man! Game over!"""
1.0,1000617-aliens,James Cameron's masterpiece in Sci-Fi!
1.0,1000617-aliens,"A sequel worthy of its predecessor, Aliens not only delivers the terrifying thrills of the first Alien but, with the help of director James Cameron, it becomes an existentially well-crafted action film with even grander visuals and even more memorable character performances."
1.0,1000617-aliens,Who needs Goliath at Six Flags when you've got Aliens: an awesome and thrilling popcorn masterpiece!
1.0,1000617-aliens,my Fav. is this one! on BL too

1.0,1000617-aliens,Jim Cameron is The man!!
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Much different than the atmospheric tension of Alien, Aliens is a potent action-packed masterpiece."
0.0,1000617-aliens,"This is a bad movie notonly because it is too dark for me, but it also promotes stealth in space with the Sulaco. There is no stealth in space as guaranteed by the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"My favorite out of the Alien movies great story, great action, great tie in to the original. If you haven't seen an Alien movie this is the one to see."
0.0,1000617-aliens,boring like the other alien movies
1.0,1000617-aliens,Great movie! Sigourney Weaver is excellent!
1.0,1000617-aliens,One of the best Sci-Fi / Horror / Action flicks of it's day and it still holds up well over the years. The practical effects and actors were truly amazing!
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Few films deserve a five star rating, but this is one of them. It's visually stunning, fantastically written, graced with some awesome actors, extremely intense, and nails both the action side of the story and the emotional one (between Newt and Ripley)."

1.0,1000617-aliens,"One of the great horror/sci-fi movies of all time, and one of the rare cases where the sequel is better than the first move."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"More action and less atmosphere than the first, it's still a blast to watch, and the last great film in the Alien saga."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Replacing dread and terror, with action and excitement could have backfired horribly here, but James Cameron's direction, Sigourney Weaver's legendary performance and thrilling special effects make Aliens one of the best and diverse sequels ever made."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Ripley is badass and this film kicks ass presenting a completely different tone than the first one, which is also perfect. It's fast-paced and a mix of scary and intense."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Without doubt, one of the very very best films of all time. We are blessed as human beings for it existing. Absolutely -perfect-."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"One of the top 5 great Sci-fi sequels in movie history, a film that truly inspires me to make film and craft awesome stories."
1.0,1000617-aliens,One of my favorites and one of the greatest sequels of all time. Aliens is a rare sequel that surpassed its predecessor. Other then alien this is the scfi horror movie that is truly a masterpiece.

1.0,1000617-aliens,A sequel that reaches the standard set of its predecessor.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"One of my all-time favorite movies. Obviously you need to see the first one to fully appreciate the second, but for me this is the rare case of the sequel being better than the original. (And the original is pretty damn good!)"
1.0,1000617-aliens,A film that's better then the first one
1.0,1000617-aliens,This film is perfection Ellen Ripley from traumatized warrant officer to a powerful woman fighting her fears amazing transformation and outstanding performance by Sigourney Weaver and a sequel better than the original
1.0,1000617-aliens,This is still one of my favorite movies of all time!!
1.0,1000617-aliens,Best sequel ever. It's been made not to squeeze money from the fans but to actually further the story.
1.0,1000617-aliens,Intense movie! Super good.
1.0,1000617-aliens,Everything from Alien was nothing compared to this one.
1.0,1000617-aliens,greatest movie of all time
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Agree Agree Agree, This Movie Was Absolutly Badass"
1.0,1000617-aliens,"One of Cameron's best films, and a brilliant sequel to Alien, because it dared to do something different. i.e. Make a Vietnam film in space as opposed to the scary house style of the first. Ofcourse now it has been done to death, but Aliens stands the test of time."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Chilling and suspenseful, and doesn't rely too heavily on violence."
1.0,1000617-aliens,Great movie that keeps u at the edge of the seat.
1.0,1000617-aliens,Just as thrilling and incredible as the first.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"James Cameron writes and directs the sequel to Alien that has great action scenes, spectacular special effects, very memorable characters, and a amazing performance by Sigourney Weaver."
1.0,1000617-aliens,(Re-watched on DVD - 31 March 2013)
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Where the 1st 1 was more of a horror come thriller this one is more action come thriller...I have to agree with a lot of the comments on here that its very rare to see a sequal that is as good as or dare I say it , better than the 1st..."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"One my favorite movies of all time. Great action, believable characters plus Bill Paxton is funny."
1.0,1000617-aliens,Pretty intense hardcore sci fi. Starts out pretty slow but gets rolling fast. Lives up to its reputation as a a superior sequel.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"Aliens isn't exactly a suspensful horror film like Alien, but it is a darn good science fiction-action film. It does everything a sequel is supposed to do and does it well."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"If you want to make a good sequal, always have more guns. Guns and action. Guns and blood. More of what you feared in the first movie is what makes a great 2nd movie. More action, more people to get killed and a bigger area. This is what Aliens had and its what made it better than the first."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"With amazing action sequences, brilliant effects work, and a strong, multi-dimensional lead character, 'Aliens' is action filmmaking at its finest."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"this movie surpasses the original alien, although alien is darker and scarier, aliens is faster paced, and has more action, and aliens"
1.0,1000617-aliens,Pretty much the best movie ever made. Ever.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"One of the best sequel of all time! James Cameron went deeper into alien mythology and delivers not only a good horror movie, but also a pure action movie. And when you see the Alien Queen you know one thing - you will get away from her (bitch)!"
1.0,1000617-aliens,Ripley jumps from a monster horror flick to a balls-out action movie with such a fluid transition you barely notice it happened. Cameron is right at home and at the top of his game.
1.0,1000617-aliens,"I actually have an old starlog magazine where the director talks about what scenes had to be cut from the story in the first movie and viola! they all ended up here. More action than suspense or horror, but still enjoy this movie."

1.0,1000617-aliens,"Love this movie. Introduced me to a greater sci-fi world that was more grounded in reality. Colonial marines in space with exo-skeletons and cool androids. While the first Alien was more suspenseful and terrifying, this one was definitely more fun."
1.0,1000617-aliens,"One of the most exciting, visually dazzling, and downright terrifying science fiction horror thrillers of all time."

1.0,1011615-king_kong,"Classic as they come, the 1933 King Kong is still the better ape despite Peter Jackson's worthy attempt. More than that, this movie - in my opinion - remains one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces of all time. Sure, it's dated, but it's still truly fascinating to watch."

1.0,1011615-king_kong,"Back in 1933, they didn't exactly have CGI just yet. But with King Kong special effects were seen to highlight the adventure on skull island. This movie helped blaze the trail for all the incredible special effects we see on the big screen today."

1.0,1099622-innocents,"""Less is more"" makes for a great ghost story. Unsettling and tragic."
1.0,1099622-innocents,The finest English gothic horror film ever produced. The beauty of the scenery and eerie old house combined with strong sexual undertones makes this stand apart from the rest of the genre. Don't miss it!

1.0,1099622-innocents,"Fabulous cinematography, a fabulous score, and a very creepy plot. ""The Others"" was based on this."
1.0,1099622-innocents,One of the scariest most beautiful films ever made. A masterclass in acting and film making. Sheer genius.
1.0,1099622-innocents,This is one of my all time favourite films. A wonderful performance by Deborah Kerr. The shot from the Summer House to the reed bed is guaranteed to give you the jitters and make you turn on the lights!
1.0,1099622-innocents,"An adult horror movie that NOT GRAPHIC but CHILLING. Doesn't seem spooky at first, but..."

1.0,1099622-innocents,"You've seen ""The Others""? Well I'm convinced that that movie copied this great B&W; horror film. Hell, even the cover looks the same. The highlight of this film is the little boy. One of the creepest kids I've seen on film yet! There's also no happy ending as well, great!"
1.0,1099622-innocents,Terrifying and intoxicating.
1.0,1099622-innocents,"Simply the greatest ghost story ever made, along with the norwegian ""De dødes tjern""! It's in black and white, and it's both elegant and tremendously creepy at the same time.

1.0,1099622-innocents,One really elegant film!
1.0,1099622-innocents,"As classic ghost movies go, you can't get a lot more creepy and atmospheric than this. The shadowy distant figures, gothic setting and haunting music are added to further by Pamela Franklin and Martin Stephens' angelic but strangely sinister child performances."
1.0,1099622-innocents,EXCELLENT!!! The movie does its job at scarying its audience. I was surprised how creepy it was because it's an older film. I will ALWAYS remember the creepy song from the movie...the song sung by a little girl. EERIE!!!! Gave me chills after I saw the movie...I recommend!!!!

1.0,1099622-innocents,"I cannot find this movie to buy it, but it was a masterful adaptation of Henry James's The Turn of the Screw. It is the creepiest movie I've ever seen. I need more than five stars.."
1.0,1099622-innocents,"A very subtle scary movie that scares you not by what you see really, but more of what you don't see. Deborah Kerr is great as the governess who appears to be seeing ghosts, or are they just in her mind?"
1.0,1099622-innocents,Very smart horror/suspense.
1.0,1099622-innocents,a fantastic horror..one of the best background scores..deborah kerr's fine performance is well supported by the child artists

1.0,1099622-innocents,My favourite horror film. Outright scary.
0.0,we_are_still_here,"This movie is not good. It is very boring, the acting is terrible and it leaves you completed confused at the end. There is no explanation to any of it."
0.0,we_are_still_here,"Sadly the ""Critic's Consensus"" couldn't be more misleading to the caliber of the filmmaking. Never has Rotten Tomatoes been so off in it's ""certified fresh"" rating seeing as it's anything but."
1.0,we_are_still_here,Slow-baking horror and devastating gore truly makes this film stand out on its own. I highly recommend this film to catch a scare with friends. Superb acting and mysterious plot adds more to the ambiguous storyline that truly makes these characters interesting.
1.0,we_are_still_here,"With a wonderful cast, loads of gore, and plot that's mostly cliché free, ""We Are Still Here"" is right for any horror fan."
0.0,we_are_still_here,"This will come off as hyperbolic, but this is one of the worst written, worst acted, worst photographed & worst directed non-student film I have ever seen. There were brief moments of promise in the first act, but they amounted to nothing.The high score from critics is baffling."
0.0,we_are_still_here,Acting was poor. Very uneventful and the story line was confusing without a resolution. Would not recommend.
0.0,we_are_still_here,"i cannot believe this movie recieved a 95% critic rating... this movie was stupid. the acting was bad & the monsters were people covered in mud wearing white contacts. yes, the ending was gory, but this was not good."
0.0,we_are_still_here,Storyline intended was good but the way the plot played out borders on ridiculous. Over-exaggerates. I rolled my eyes and laughed more than I got spooked.
0.0,we_are_still_here,"""Manos: The Hands of Fate"" has just been dethroned! ""We Are Still Here"" is the new worst horror movie ever made! The king is dead... long live the king!"
0.0,we_are_still_here,"Predictable, overhyped garbage. It's a travesty how this is rated 95% fresh. The film is formulaic trash."
0.0,we_are_still_here,"Senseless plot. Storyline is painfully slow, characters are shallow. Waste of time."
0.0,we_are_still_here,"Starts off really slow and a little hard to stay interested. It's not scary in my opinion. I wouldn't waste your time on this movie, nothing special and there's much better horror movies out there to watch"
1.0,we_are_still_here,"It's Familiar, and it's not try to be clever, but how the movie turned the familiar territory to a refreshing new feel it's perfect, and the final act was so shocking and blood-splattering"
1.0,we_are_still_here,surprisingly not bad at all.
0.0,we_are_still_here,what the hell were you watching when you rated this piece of crap. seriously any critic that gave this a good review should be fired. its a no brainer.
0.0,we_are_still_here,"Tried to watch it last night, very poorly made. The camera moves up and down when following a character, sometimes it stops halfway into a doorway to keep the doorframe in the picture. I coudnt watch any further"
0.0,we_are_still_here,"This is awful. Bad acting, bad story, bad dialogues, just bloody awful."
0.0,we_are_still_here,"Smart? Devilishly clever? Every single move in this film was predictable.At some point, they just showed views of New England for no reason. There was a waterfall too. The only good thing about this movie is the poster."
1.0,we_are_still_here,Absolutely Riveting!!!
0.0,we_are_still_here,Surprised that rotten tomatoes showed 95%. Gave it a try. It was a really lame didnt feel any connection with caracters.
0.0,we_are_still_here,Terrible movie... Insidious was much better... I do not understand how this movie has such a high rating... Terrible and incomplete ending.
0.0,we_are_still_here,I can't think of anything good to say about this ... Utter Rubbish
0.0,we_are_still_here,"The first fifteen minutes are genuinely scary. The rest of the movie is just gore, ridiculous and unoriginal."
0.0,we_are_still_here,Not sure why the great reviews. The movie was nothing but stolen scenes from other movies. If you've seen a lot of horror movies you will recognize most of them. The end made little sense and the storyline was absurd. Incidentally I'm a big fan of horror movies. this was silly.
0.0,we_are_still_here,"How the hell this got 92% is beyond me. There are a couple of good jump scares and thats about as far as the scares go. Bad acting, bad dialogue, lame nonsensical storyline. Laughable."
0.0,we_are_still_here,Too bad I cannot put less than 1/2 star...
0.0,we_are_still_here,"This was a really bad movie. The acting is bad, the writing is bad, and the cinematography is a joke. You can tell nobody thought too hard about what they were making, they just got it over with. It just doesn't seem like a sincere effort was made for this movie."
1.0,we_are_still_here,A good cult-retro-suburban-conceptual-psycho-paranormal-70s-thriller movie
1.0,we_are_still_here,"this was so FUN and SO scary. I was very VERY pleasantly surprised. The ending sequences are such a treat and a true GIFT to horror fans! THESE filmmakers ""get"" true horror. Thank You!"
1.0,we_are_still_here,Every thirty years it wakes every thirty years it wants a family every thirty years it wants blood!!!!!
0.0,we_are_still_here,"Oh boy, I saw it because of the high rating here. Didn't notice that the reviewers are not from any notable publications. This movie is awful. Terrible acting, inane dialogue... When I began to treat it as a comedy, it became somewhat bearable."
0.0,we_are_still_here,"Not unlike The House Of The Devil, it's a hollow celebration of classic horror films from the 70s. The poster is the best thing about it."
1.0,santa_sangre,"I adored the film not for its horror, which is ample, but for its ingenious story and the seemingly boundless imagination of its creator."
1.0,santa_sangre,Extraordinary film. Magnificent directing and mind bending story. One of the must watch classics.
1.0,santa_sangre,"Jodorowsky's most ""accessible"" film. It is also his most emotionally moving and almost as thought provoking as ""El Topo."" Perhaps not as strictly spiritual, but emotional on a very human level."
1.0,santa_sangre,"In my humble opinion, the greatest metaphysical slasher film ever made. Utterly Dazzling and horrifying to behold. Jodowrsky's masterpiece."
1.0,santa_sangre,"Adiós mujer, adiós para siempre, adiós."
1.0,santa_sangre,"The ever-present Jodorowskian motifs make for another mystical and in depth trip of a film, albeit a little less surreal than previous entries."
1.0,santa_sangre,It's an Art House film on crack!
1.0,santa_sangre,"AsÃ­ como FÃ (C)nix era las manos de Concha,JODOROWSKY es alma del subconciente surrealista."
1.0,santa_sangre,"Amazingly complex, tons of symbolism that manages to be trippy and thought provoking all at the same time. A thrilling ride that is strange and never stops being interesting."
1.0,santa_sangre,"Art house horror masterpiece, battered in dreamy, seedy passion and served drunk with punchy Spanish style."
1.0,santa_sangre,"This might have been the most brilliantly, well thought out movie I have ever seen. However, this is not for the weak."
1.0,santa_sangre,exeptional masterpiece...
1.0,santa_sangre,"not for the faint of heart. an unforgettable experience, for better or worse."
1.0,santa_sangre,"Jodorowsky never fails to bring the goods, this movie is no exception. It is fairly twisted and gruesome in highly creative and original ways."
1.0,santa_sangre,"Great director, great screenplay, great music. Well, the actors didn't play much well but it may be the only film ever that I said ""Who cares for the actors?""."
1.0,santa_sangre,"The best and most accesible film that Jodorowsky made. It's an absolute masterpiece thanks to it's great visuals, music and script."

0.0,santa_sangre,"25 minutes into this, I neither knew or cared what was going on. This is a ginormous waste of time. The production is awful, the plot is all over the place and completely nonsensical, and the acting is... well, nonexistent. I shouldn't have waited as long as I did to shut it off."

1.0,santa_sangre,Psycho revised by a mystic surrealist. Beond great.

0.0,santa_sangre,"I'm sorry, I really am, but for me this movie was just terrible, and difficult to sit through the whole thing. Not because it was disturbing, because it was boring. This is one ""artsy gore-fest"" that I have not enjoyed. Sorry, better luck next time."
1.0,santa_sangre,"This is a fucking brilliant movie, that you should all see. But you won't, because your all too busy wanking yourselves over crap like Twilight and Avatar."
1.0,santa_sangre,A slasher film as only Jodorowsky could make it. Has he ever done a bad movie?
1.0,santa_sangre,"My kind of movie. May be too trippy or old style for some. I'd recommend this as a first Jodorowsky film; then Holy Mountain. Don't watch either if you didn't like Brazil, Jacob's Ladder, or the Wall."

1.0,santa_sangre,woooooooow esta muy loquito!!!
1.0,santa_sangre,"The perfect weird movie. Crammed with the startling imagery. If you are sick of seeing the same old big budget Hollywood movies, this is what you should scope. I wish a R1 DVD would be released. Be on the look out for 'King Shot', Jodorowsky's first film in over 20 years!"
1.0,santa_sangre,Great movie reminds me of psycho

1.0,santa_sangre,It's just amaaaazing!!
1.0,santa_sangre,Just like El topo this another slice of bonker's brillance from Alejandro Jodrowsky.
1.0,santa_sangre,"Una muestra de como debe ser el cine mexicano (siendo que ni siquiera es mexicana del todo). Sangrienta, hilarante, bizarra y artesanal. Algo que solo puede ser concebido en la idiosincrasia latinoamericana."
1.0,santa_sangre,"An exceptional film about a traumatized magician who seeks to avenge the things he has experienced as a child. The film is beautifully surreal and strange, but in the end, very moving and very sane."
1.0,santa_sangre,This is one of my favorite movies. The cast the director.EVERYTHING.
0.0,santa_sangre,It took me 3 days to watch this. Some nice scenes but on the whole totally uninteresting.
1.0,santa_sangre,"My favorite movie. Helps enjoying the film if you are familiar with psychoanalysts concepts like anima, animus, oedipus complex. I liked it only the second time i saw."
1.0,santa_sangre,"Pure entertainment. I like the way you have to use your imagination, rather than relying on glossy special effects to tell the story. Incredibly clear and well shot. Great music. Fantastic."
1.0,santa_sangre,"The main feature of this movie is its excellent imagery: parading circus performers, fully tattooed women, armless saints, temples of blood, XXXXL prostitutes, the strongest ""woman"" in the world, dead white brides. It gets better and it gets worse. It's beautiful."
1.0,santa_sangre,I might like the movie poster a bit more than the film.
1.0,santa_sangre,"great movie,GREAT SCORE TOOK ME OVER TO YEAR TO FIND VERY WELL FOR THE WAIT,"

1.0,santa_sangre,JOdorowsky is truly amazing. Even the most grotesque scenes are beautiful.
1.0,santa_sangre,"So I recentley rewatched this movie, and I had forgotten how great it was. All of the characters are so full, and vivid. They seem real."
1.0,santa_sangre,oh yes..my kinda movie..bizarre..a disturbing masterpiece!
1.0,santa_sangre,Brilliant. It's like Psycho meets Hammer meets crazy Mexican psychosexual what-have-yous. Jodorowsky definitely had more self-control here than in his previous works.
1.0,santa_sangre,One of my favorites!
1.0,santa_sangre,Great movie... perfect story line about a circus and a worshiped blood goddess.
1.0,santa_sangre,Amazing film! I love Jodorowsky!

1.0,santa_sangre,Excelente para el que la ha visto! una pérdida para el que no la conoce

1.0,santa_sangre,increiblemente surrealista
1.0,santa_sangre,Genial Obra Del Maestro Jodorowsky
1.0,santa_sangre,"Extremely violent and bizarre. Another absolutely amazing film by Jodorwsky. The opening flashback sequence with the POV of the eagle flying over the city is an amazing shot. The film in general is gorgeous, but what else would you expect from Jodorowsky."
1.0,santa_sangre,"Quite possibly the strangest, most bizarre, most captivating movie you will ever watch. Good luck finding it..."
1.0,santa_sangre,"After a second viewing, I'd be crazy to not consider this one of the best movies I've ever seen."
1.0,santa_sangre,"Cathartic like a fever breaking. If you can tolerate the violence and ugliness, the resultant peace and beauty is elevating."
1.0,santa_sangre,Just one of my favourite films ever. It's up there with some recognizably 'better' films because it has magic.
1.0,santa_sangre,I hope to never recover from this movie.
1.0,santa_sangre,"A surreal, twisted and beautiful story with an interesting take on Oedipal themes. A decadent and romantic portrayal of a circus, and some really funny and cheeky jokes... One of my all-time favourites."
1.0,santa_sangre,Surreal and oh so good! The use of colour kept my eyes glued to the screen.
1.0,santa_sangre,"Absurd but not as far from reality as you could ""imagine""."
1.0,santa_sangre,One of only two films that made me weap...as an adult.
1.0,santa_sangre,"sick, bizarre, distubing, brutal, sadistic, and creepy. Good stuff."
1.0,santa_sangre,"Perhaps Jodorowsky's most accessible work. Brutal, grotesque and violent in so many levels (not only graphically) like all of his movies but with a better plot and a more consistent result. Fantastic movie"
1.0,santa_sangre,"Oh Jodorowksy, you haunt my nightmares every time I see one of your films. Absolutely surreal, brilliant, and..... still trying to figure out the full meaning. But damned good."
1.0,santa_sangre,"I saw this when it came out in the theaters and it blew me and my friends away .its a insane combination of ultra violence repulsion and pure gentle innocence ""the kiss"" in the movie is one of the best kiss shots ive ever seen. not for the kiddies and people scared of clowns :)"

0.0,santa_sangre,"Rarely do I stop to rate a film I hate, but once in a while something is so absurd, so violent, so idiotic and so FULL of itself that it deserves it."

1.0,santa_sangre,this is possibly my favorite movie ever.
1.0,santa_sangre,jodorowski is a master of the surreal film making
1.0,santa_sangre,Moved me to tears every time.
1.0,santa_sangre,Jodorowsky's films are to the cinematic medium what the sideshow is to the circus: You're always guaranteed a parade of decadent sights and woefully disfigured characters. The impossible-to-shake SANTA SANGRE is his best film to date.
1.0,santa_sangre,bizarre and tragic and so compelling that it becomes impossible to irracinate from your mind as you and Jodo descend into this mad tale... excellent opening credit sequence with the eagle flying into town!

1.0,santa_sangre,not exactly a review. just wanted to say this is one of my favourite films!!
1.0,santa_sangre,"Very much a tribute to all the greats of horror, Argento and Hitchcock included. Amazing, though."
1.0,santa_sangre,"Jodorowsky's true return after his long cinematic slumber (no, Tusk and The Rainbow Thief do not count), Santa Sangre is simply beautiful. Harrowing, often hilarious, conceptually linking esoteric material from the Tarot to Artaud to Hitchcock.....fantastic shit. Watch it, fools."
1.0,santa_sangre,Jodorowsky has created a Norman Bates character and let him out of the house to wonder freely. Visualy stunning and horrificly twisted as you'd expect from the master of weird.
1.0,santa_sangre,"Finally, a story of love and passion that truly hurts. Circus, death, freaks and colorful magic with beautiful music. Just the way I like it!"
1.0,santa_sangre,Truly one of the most beautifully disturbing films I have ever seen. This is not for the squeamish nor for fans of the usual Hollywood brand of psychological thriller.
1.0,santa_sangre,"Jodorowsky is a master of making myths and metaphors in sequences of meaning. If you want something easy and light-hearted, this will open your sinuses, possibly even your thinking. :)"
1.0,santa_sangre,HAHAHA THIS MOVIE WAS AMAZING!! And Fenix was a TOTAL BABE. I just want to hug him
1.0,santa_sangre,greatest weird film of all times. Even Jodorowsky may never be able to top this masterpiece!
1.0,santa_sangre,My favorite movie of all time.
1.0,santa_sangre,"yeah, yeah, yeah Jodorowsky... la escena de la procesión del elefante ufff"
1.0,santa_sangre,"I love this movie. This is one of my absolute favourites, I have seen it more than 20 times. Not as weird as El Topo or Holy Mountain, but very beautiful and moving."
1.0,santa_sangre,Really great surreal horror. Every bit as good as its reputation suggests.
1.0,santa_sangre,I saw this movie in '89 and have never forgotten it.
1.0,santa_sangre,One of my top Jodorowsky movies. He captures here what Psycho didn't do for me. The conflict of a boy and his mother. A+
1.0,santa_sangre,Masterpiece of Argentinian surealizm...
1.0,santa_sangre,Absolutely nuts -- everyone should see it once.The elephant funeral has to be seen to be believed.
1.0,santa_sangre,"The first 20 Felliniesque minutes might come across as tedious on first viewing, but the mind-blowing twist at the end outdoes Shyamalan, not to mention the whole thing is so creepy and surreal like a nightmare. That mood comes across beautifully. Anyway, see this TWICE."
1.0,santa_sangre,Disturbing and grotesque!
1.0,santa_sangre,A trip down the twisted mind of a serial killer. Amazing imagery which confirms that Jodorowsky is a crazy genius.
1.0,santa_sangre,"if you like frazy visuals watch this, warning its not for the easily queezy"
1.0,santa_sangre,You must see to comprehend.
1.0,santa_sangre,"Jodorwsky is my favourite director, film-maker. if you like this film you must watch holy mountain and el topo. like most of his films you will see freaks and gore. like always his films are intelligent and well thought out."
1.0,santa_sangre,AMAZING! jodorowsky is a genius. i have ideas like him. ;) hahaha
1.0,santa_sangre,"I think that we need to add another adjective to the english language, because there is no way to describe the way you feel after you watch this film. The film itsself is dazzling, disturbing, and flat out incredible. Alejandro Jodorowsky is a genius!!!"
1.0,santa_sangre,Ffilm gore Jodorowsky. Ffilm arswyd/cyffro swreal a rhithweledol!Stori bach gwych a trist.
1.0,santa_sangre,Wonderful. And very beautiful. But totally bonkers and equally twisted.
1.0,santa_sangre,Intelligent and emotional. Don't be scared off by the title. If you love a movie thats artistic and makes you think please see this!
1.0,santa_sangre,Top 20. Visually stunning.
1.0,santa_sangre,"Estremadamente bizarra, pero muy fina"
1.0,santa_sangre,Best film ever!!! Like if Psycho was directed by an actual psycho! From Mexico!
1.0,santa_sangre,"Amazing story, and the imagery gives a heavy workout for the mind."
1.0,santa_sangre,"The ultimate shroom movie! I can't count how many times i watched this (probably cuz i was high) but the story trips me out everytime. I even made 3 bootlegs of it that wound up disappearing amongst friends. Hard to find, but so worth it."
1.0,santa_sangre,"The most morbid, grotesque, mind boggling, touching, heart wrenching movie I think I have ever seen."
1.0,santa_sangre,A film for life and aboeut life and everything else in life
1.0,santa_sangre,The greatest slasher movie ever...and perhaps one of the strangest genre movies in human history.
1.0,santa_sangre,it's quality. you think it's going to be cheesy but it isn't. the ending is really beautiful.
1.0,santa_sangre,"An underrated classic! The symbolism in this movie is simply brilliant, beautifully shot, and just creepy! Fans of Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" and fans of culty art-films like ""Eraserhead"" should take note!"
1.0,santa_sangre,this is one of my all time favorite films. thank you jodorowsky

1.0,slither,"The mayor's breakdown is so hilarious, you can only imagine yourself doing the same thing. When there is an alien/zombie invasion afoot, the last thing you need is to run out of your favourite soda."

1.0,it_follows,Top 5 Horror movie of all time
0.0,it_follows,Original and fresh concept only made a horror by the outright stupidity of the protagonists in a manner often typical of modern american horror. You will likely not want to watch it a second time.
1.0,it_follows,"A truly different and remarkable horror movie, no wonder it was chosen as the best horror flick of 2015.

0.0,it_follows,"How did this get such good reviews from critics? All I've read are raves but I thought it was terrible. The plot leaves a lot to be desired but, most importantly, it wasn't scary. I would've given it 2 stars but I gave it a half star to counter balance these head scratching rave reviews."

1.0,get_out,"Fantastic and very creative movie. It's always entertaining, and I was always interested to figure out what the fuck was really going on. Some great funny moments as well in the middle of all the tension and suspense."
0.0,get_out,"I do not know how anyone finds this movie good at all, this is so far from any type of reality. The people who rated this movie good are probably the same people who like the fast and the furious movies ( so far from any reality)"

1.0,get_out,"This is the most inventive and original films to come out in a long time. A round of applause for Jordan Peele. This movie was highly entertaining. Equal parts funny and scary, with a very clever plot, Get Out truly is a landmark. I cannot say enough good things about this. Go watch it. Now."

0.0,get_out,The most overrated film of all the time.
0.0,get_out,The plot is dumber than any of the cheesy Friday the 13th or Jason movies ever made. Ridiculous that it's up for best picture. Clown world.
1.0,get_out,"A smart script and nuanced direction make this film an unforgettable experience. One of the best films of 2017, if not THE best."
0.0,get_out,It was really stupid. And I couldn't help but get the feeling that it was pushing a liberal agenda. Also this film was obviously race baiting and if the roles were reversed there would be a massive outcry from the black community. This movie was racist and distasteful.
1.0,get_out,"I Really Like The Movie, Keep Me Thinking And The Plot Twist Are Awesome."
1.0,get_out,"An excellent Scary Thriller, with a hint of horror"
0.0,get_out,Pretentious over rated movie made for the awards

0.0,get_out,Absolutely chod. Would rather watch a .gif of a hippo spraying dung about than watch this again.
0.0,get_out,pretty much the worst movie of the past decade - really corny - needed to be edited so it wasn't choppy from scene to scene. say your time and watch basketball instead.
0.0,get_out,could have been really good but they made it fairly ridiculous especially the ending

0.0,get_out,This movie was very bad who would think white people would kidnap black men to transfer their mind to them . The story has no plot and was not scary . i don't see how this movie made 250 million and the director needs to find another career.
0.0,get_out,"I enjoyed the Skeleton Key more, which is the film that Get Out ripped off."
1.0,get_out,"It's properly scary and just phenomenally well done. Get Out is a beat for beat perfect horror movie and a surprisingly intricate and nuanced exploration of race relations in America. If you aren't yelling at the screen by halfway through the movie, I don't know who you are."
0.0,get_out,"Most racist and boring ""scary"" movie ever! #OVERATED"

1.0,get_out,Loved every minute of it.
0.0,get_out,Jordan Peele stole The Skelton Key plotline and made it transparently racist. There is zero subtlety to this film. All it does is reveal what the auteur director thinks about white people which is much more racist than the characters in the film itself.
1.0,get_out,"Amazing film, filled with suspense and master class in directing; not one cheap thrill or jumpscares."
1.0,get_out,One of the best horror movies I've ever seen. Perfectly executed.

1.0,get_out,Very creative and suspenseful story and a great cast. Excellent work by Jordan Peele.
0.0,get_out,"This movie gets great reviews because of the PC garbage era. He's a Black guy getting attacked by a White Family, and of course, we've never really seen that before in a movie, outside of slave films. Anyone who likes this movie is clearly an idiot."

0.0,get_out,"Really? How did they get this picture financed? B acting at best, unbelievable plot. Unrealistic, and a total waste of time."
1.0,get_out,The best movie of 2017 hands down! A brilliant and clever thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat. A fantastic main character you can root for and a creepily designed villain.

1.0,get_out,I'm not one to like horror or thriller movies but I really enjoyed this one. It's just so well done!
0.0,get_out,Just a horrible movie with bad acting and a cheap storyline. Peele does great at comedy and should focus his works there. This was more racial crap that had a bad ending.
1.0,get_out,One of the best films I've ever seen and unlike anything else that came out this year. Kudos to Peele for his forward thinking direction and script and the brilliant acting of the whole cast. Would be great to see Kaluuya get a Best Actor Oscar nom!
0.0,get_out,"Wow, incredibly disappointed with this film, had just high expectations going to see it. Sometimes I really don't understand what some people see in a movie, it's not a horror movie at all, not the least bit scary and hardly interesting."

1.0,get_out,I was really impressed and moved. original ideas. I am interested in the next movie this director has to offer. all the negative reviews were really interesting to read. people need to appreciate the acting and having the guts to try something different. they should sink into the floor. lol
0.0,get_out,"Combo of Skeleton Key, Wickerman, Stepford Wives and a host of others. Was good in the first third but was easy to guess the story and went down quickly after that.The way he escapes is ludicrous and contrived.Save your money it'll be free on Netflix soon."

1.0,get_out,Best movie I've seen this year. Thought it would be kinda predictable but the twists just kept coming.

0.0,get_out,"I found this predictable,slow paced and boring, a weak rehashing of the stepford wives concept. Other reviews talk of great humour, a lot of the humour plays on stereotypical behaviour, basic slapstick attempts at breaking a tension that I felt never really built."

1.0,pans_labyrinth,"This film is pretty dark, especially for a fairy tale. It's true what they say, this film really is a fairy tale for adults. The storyline is flawless, and I'm glad that its in Spanish with subtitles. It's more authentic that way. I love this film so much!"

0.0,the_loved_ones_2012,"Very low budget, amateurish slasher flick. More so than the usual slasher flick. It was a relatively stupid plot -- what there was of one -- and single camera shortcuts with facial closeups of the psychos providing the major 'screams' in the movie. How this manages to garner a 97% I'll never know."

1.0,the_conjuring,"Best horror movie. Filled with genuinely scary and suspenseful moments from the opening scene until the credits roll.

1.0,the_conjuring,best horror film in the last 5 years
1.0,the_conjuring,The Conjuring is one of the greatest horror movies of the last sixteen years and relies on genuine scares over blood and gore. One of the few movies I have trouble watching alone.

1.0,the_conjuring,scary as hell but conjuring 2 is scarier
1.0,the_conjuring,"Great contemporary horror movie. Really creepy with a good story. It succeeds in being genuinely scary without trying to cheat with gore to make you uncomfortable. It's pretty rare to see a good horror, which is why a lot of people don't like the genre, so this movie is pretty refreshing."
1.0,the_conjuring,"When a horror movie borrows familiar elements and tropes from other films, yet still manages to feel fresh while providing a plethora of scares, you know your film is a winner."
1.0,the_conjuring,"Horror that is terrifying through atmosphere instead of gore that combines amazing writing, acting, and direction."
1.0,the_conjuring,"love this movie me and my partner have seen it a few times and find it brilliant,can't wait for the 2nd movie in 2016"
1.0,the_conjuring,"I read the book of Ed & Lorraine Warren: The Demonologist. To all who doubt their work, I dare you to encounter these inhuman forces and still not be convinced of the truth."
1.0,the_conjuring,Finally a horror movie that is an achievement and not another pile of crap.
1.0,the_conjuring,"Not only is it fun and has perfect atmosphere, it's one of those rare perfect horror films to come out this decade! A+"
1.0,the_conjuring,The Conjuring is a deeply scary film that expertly crafts frightening imagery and tension to make the audience clench their seats. This is quite a rarity in horror films but the characters were extremely likeable which lead to me fearing for their lives....

1.0,the_conjuring,"This is it. It's as good as haunted-house movies can get. Straight-up terrifying. No gore, language, or sex -- it's rated R just for being scary. Awesome. Bonus points to James Wan for knowing his way around a zoom lens. See it you guys."

1.0,the_conjuring,The best new horror movie made in a long time
1.0,the_conjuring,The only reason this movies is not 100 on the list of best horror movies is that it is rated by movie viewers who have 0 understanding of horror...The smartest horror ever written.

1.0,the_conjuring,Astonishing movie but scares the hell out of you
1.0,the_conjuring,"A really scary movie! I enjoyed it very much. I like Vera Farmiga and try to watch her films. I especially enjoyed ""Running Scared"" with Paul Walker. She does well playing strong female roles and this movie was no exception. If you like scares,watch this movie!"
1.0,the_conjuring,"The best recently made horror film in the last five years, along with Insidious that are both made by James Wan"
1.0,the_conjuring,The great thing about The Conjuring is that it builds so much suspense and gets you with the little things. like a door shaming or hands clapping. This proves that horror could still be made good. If it gets the attention that it needs.

1.0,let_me_in,One of the best remakes.
1.0,let_me_in,"Con todo y sus ligeros cambios con respecto a la versión original sueca, Let Me In es igualmente conmovedora y espeluznante al mismo tiempo, así como una sumamente original historia de vampiros, que incluye un par de grandes actuaciones por parte de Chloe Grace Moretz y Kodi Smit McPhee."
1.0,let_me_in,Filme muito bom mesmo e que consegue me tocar mesmo em meio a cenas de puro sangue.

1.0,let_me_in,Even though this is a remake it's a fresh take on the Vampire Genre and much needed in a sea of bad Vampire stories. The twist about Abby's origins is a shocker which this remake doesn't reveal like the original Let the Right One In or the novel it's based off.

1.0,let_me_in,I finally picked a movie that we both enjoyed :)
1.0,let_me_in,"The best of all the vampire/human love story movies. It shows a lot of the problems such a relationship would likely have. Also, the vampires don't sparkle."

0.0,let_me_in,"The only thing I liked about it was the cover-art of the film. Besides that, I rather sit and watch all the Twilight movies in a row than this.No... actually, I wouldn't want to put myself in that kind of misery."
1.0,let_me_in,Just as good as Let The Right One In. See both!
1.0,let_me_in,"Update: I want to see this again.I liked it a lot, but not as much as Let The Right One In. Great cinematography, acting, lighting, music, sets, makeup and wardrobe but it still fell painfully short of Let The Right One In. Not a remake, but adaptation (of the book)."

1.0,let_me_in,Excellent under rated movie
1.0,let_me_in,"Visually, it's wonderful to look at. The acting is top notch. The kids are great, and I adore Richard Jenkins. What really sets this film apart is its long scenes of silence, allowing the viewer to soak in the film's emotions."

1.0,eraserhead,The one that started it all. Very ahead of its time. Definitely the most surreal movie Lynch has ever done.
0.0,eraserhead,"Complete garbage. When it comes to desperately trying to look weird or interesting, David Lynch consistently displays more shame than any teenager I've ever seen walking into a Hot Topic. This is a highly acclaimed film because critics and cinema-philes rarely have testicles."

1.0,room_237_2012,An amazing introspective into Kubricks mind and the many worlds of The Shining! It's almost told as Stanley would tell it and works out theories that consistent viewers have never had the balls to put on film. Job well done ; OH and thanks for helping my moon theory

0.0,room_237_2012,I don't understand all of the great ratings. This was the worst movie I have seen in decades. The adaptions made by random people were silly and quite ridiculous. We left after 40 min into it. Really a waste of money.
