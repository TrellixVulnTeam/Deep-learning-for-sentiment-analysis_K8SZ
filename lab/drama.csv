1.0,searchers,"The Searchers was definitely a treat to sit through. From its great musical score, amazing action scenes, terrific script, and fantastic performances (particularly from John Wayne), it is regarded as one of cinema's finest westerns for a damn good reason!Overall Grade: A+ (10/10)"
1.0,searchers,"Has to be near top of the list in all genre of movies, of Westerns it is at the top. A near Perfect Movie. Wayne is brutal, maniacal and all too Human as Ethan Edwards. Rest of Cast in also Top Notch."
1.0,searchers,"A must see. A masterpiece. Perhaps, just the best movie in History.View several times, last time in the Filmoteca espa√±ola (The Spanish Film Library, Madrid)"
1.0,searchers,May be the best western film ever made. Unapologeticly shows the struggle of life on the frontier and the thin line between revenge and redemption.
1.0,searchers,"Westerns have a history of simplification and, for a long time, needed a more thorough tackling of the genre. That is why John Ford's darker undertaking starring the Duke, himself, is both a relief and the greatest revisioning of the heart of Westerns."
1.0,searchers,Best Western ever alongside Unforgiven.

1.0,searchers,One of the grandest films ever made.
1.0,searchers,The Searchers has beautiful photography with such elaborate details on composition and framing. The story intensifies as we are also given some good humour and lighter tones. The sweeping scope of the valleys and deserts are attractive and there's a great handle on its art production.

1.0,searchers,"Without a doubt one of the greatest movies of all time and certainly up there as one of the best westerns of all time, if not the best western of all time. A forgotten, under-appreciated movie that just happens to be a masterpiece."
1.0,searchers,One of those great films that even those that love it are a bit ambivalent about and I think that is a very good thing. Great art should make you a bit uncomfortable.
1.0,searchers,Greatest Western of all time!!!!!

1.0,searchers,"One of the best westerns ever made, unforgettable film."
1.0,searchers,The weight of a 3 religious epic jam packed into a less than 2 hour cowboy epic chronicling mainly the exploits of 2 men in a game of cat and mouse with the band of Comanche that slaughtered their family in the postbellum West.
1.0,searchers,I don't think Western genre can get any better than this.
1.0,searchers,"This one breaks the tomatometer. If you can, get a copy with Director Peter Bogdanovich's commentary. It opened my eyes to the Master's skill."
0.0,searchers,"This movie tries to create complex characters but fails with inconstancy, bad acting, and cliches. Its ""grand"" vistavision cinematography is great at first but goes nowhere. Nothing in this movie develops well. This is probably the most overrated western if not movie of all time."

1.0,searchers,One of John Wayne's best westerns. What a loss Jefferey Hunter was.
1.0,searchers,"Featuring moments of splendour and one of John Wayne's greatest performances, The Searchers studies the disunions of American character, with its quest for justice, its lust for violence, its spirit of companionship and its search for freedom."
1.0,searchers,The Searchers is captivating and surprisingly grim at times.

1.0,searchers,"Vengeance in its obsessive, destructive form, that's what John Ford's masterpiece is all about, and what Ford's mis-en-scene expresses so eloquently, inimitably. With perhaps one of the greatest final shots in all of cinema."
1.0,searchers,Both Ford and Wayne at the top of their game.
1.0,searchers,"A film that demands multiple viewings with Wayne at his finest as conflicted Ethan Edwards and the poetic prose of Ford's master hands evident throughout, especially when placing Edwards violent past and consequential present against the gorgeous backdrop of Monument Valley."

1.0,searchers,"Probably the best western I have ever seen. This almost makes True Grit look like a joke, and I gave it 5 stars. John Wayne has got to be one of the manliest men to have ever lived. Beautifully shot, entertaining, and just a great film."
1.0,searchers,"One of the greatest westerns ever made is also one of the most multi-layered with its messages of racism, bigotry, and the cruelties of the dying western frontier. This is arguably John Wayne's finest performance. A must see for Cinephiles!!!"
0.0,searchers,To dislike this genre of film is apparently tabooed but I have to say I found the portrayal of Native Americans/Indians in this film nothing short of offensive and I saw John wayne as the very definition of racist.. But seeing as the movie was made during that time.

1.0,searchers,"Though a film from 1956, The Searchers remains one of the darkest films about human nature I have ever seen. It's dark tone is balanced with its themes of family life and merry gatherings, and in doing so provides both the perfect combination of entertainment and poetic storytelling."
1.0,searchers,They just don't make Westerns like this anymore.
1.0,searchers,My favourite western (probably). A grim story and the cinematography is brilliant and has been immitated in many films since.

1.0,searchers,A classic John Wayne film. Could possibly be his darkest role.
1.0,searchers,Brilliant movie! Beautifully shot with great performance by John Wayne.
1.0,searchers,The best western ever made... there will be no arguments.
1.0,searchers,"In my opinion, the best work of both John Wayne and John Ford. The scenery alone makes it worth watching. John Wayne's most powerful role; how the Duke was not even nominated for Best Actor baffles me."
1.0,searchers,"That'll be the day when anyone is justified in criticising The Duke! This is not only a great western (and in my mind the best western ever made), but it's also one of the greatest movies ever made. The colour and expanse of Monument Valley surely influenced Kubrick when he made 2001."
1.0,searchers,this is a film that was filmed when films were films.

1.0,searchers,"Best western I've seen, with John Ford's direction at its best. If you're a John Wayne fan, be prepared for the darkest, best performance of his career. Young Jeffrey Hunter and Natalie Wood, who both died young, are terrific. And what's a John Wayne/John Ford movie without Ward Bond?"
1.0,searchers,I love how John Wayne just walks off into the sunset after 5 years of chasing after his niece. I suspect that he was going to take a nap.

1.0,selma,"Selma is a gripping recreation of the titular march bolstered by David Oyelowo's magnificent and uncanny performance as Martin Luther Jing Jr. And it avoids the demonization of whites where many have fell before. We don't need a full MLK biopic, this will do well."

1.0,selma,A perfect movie of a part of the life of Martin Luther King
1.0,selma,"I think this is a must-see movie, esp right now, in this part of the world. Part of the success is the way the movie focuses on the strategy sessions in the background and the ethical dilemmas that arise out of these sessions, in contrast to the completely unreflective police brutality."

1.0,selma,great portrayal of what they had to go through
0.0,selma,"Boring, makes things up. Democrats are cheering a movie where they show how black people have overcome the oppression of Democrats. The movie portrayed MLK as an opportunist, and not a great man. I was hoping this would have done a better job of portraying MLK, but it failed."

1.0,selma,Selma is purely phenomenal. The story and scenery really accurate to the real life March. David Oyelowo was Dr. King in every way shape or form. Interesting why he didn't get the Oscar Nod but he outshined this role in my book. My favorite Black History movie since the Color Purple.
1.0,selma,"Some individuals might say why are we still making movies such as this. My response will always be, because it still exist today. Loved it! Lets make a change......"

1.0,1012928-m,"Lang's haunting masterpiece has much in common with another cinematic treasure, 'The Night of The Hunter'"
1.0,1012928-m,"One of the best suspense films of all time. If you haven't seen this, you should. 1001 movies to see before you die."
1.0,1012928-m,"You have to be an Avengers-spoiled brat to not like this. This is absolutely phenomenal for its time. The fact that it's relevant and great still, shows that this is a true masterpiece."
1.0,1012928-m,This movie is sooo good. How can you not like a movie this? M is one of those classics that will always stand the test of time. Definitely deserves a re-watch.
1.0,1012928-m,"Suspenseful, emotional, gritty, this movie has it all. A story about a child murderer is so gut-wrenching, yet so good."
1.0,1012928-m,Surprisingly sordid for its time.
1.0,1012928-m,"A rare nail-bitting soul-searcher, ""M"" still stands as one of the greatest films ever made for cinema. Director Fritz Land and actor Peter Lorre help deliver a timeless Masterpiece."
1.0,1012928-m,"Amazing. Simply an incredible film. Pete Lorre in his best performance is disturbing and somehow tragic. Masterfully made. It says a lot that a movie this old, is still more effective than most movies these days..."
1.0,1012928-m,A tour-de-force of directing that I really need to rewatch.
1.0,1012928-m,Perfect proto film noir/mystery/social commentary. Most entertaining game of cat and mouse ever depicted.
1.0,1012928-m,De lo mejor que he visto en my life
1.0,1012928-m,"Police procedural, thriller, indictment of society . . . Lang is doing so many things so well at once it's enthralling. That a nearly 85 year old movie is still relevant isn't entirely surprising, that it may still be controversial, is."
1.0,1012928-m,Still as shocking today as it was 80 something years ago.
1.0,1012928-m,"Masterful in every respect, M provides a scathing indictment of mob mentality and the ultimate negligence of those who wish to proceed by way of emotion rather than reason, a universal message as relevant today as it was back in 1931."
1.0,1012928-m,"-IGNORE THIS ""OUT OF FIVE"" RATING4/4Chilling early talkie about a child murderer put on trial by citizens, not the law. Fascinating psychological thriller asks not to sympathize with its killer, but to understand him. Peter Lorre is still great, many famous scenes, and yep, one of the greats."
1.0,1012928-m,Ground breaking and the creation of the psychological thriller. This is truly a masterpiece which will live in history.
1.0,1012928-m,The first definitive psychlogical thriller.
1.0,1012928-m,"Fritz Lang's M stands as a landmark psychological thriller that dares to sympathize with a child murderer who can't help himself. Lorre's debut is one for the ages, and over 80 years later, this landmark looms large over every psychological made. Beyond Essential."
1.0,1012928-m,Considering how this film floored me! I can't begin to imagine how it floored audiences in 1930's whom were totally unprepared for such a disturbing theme and genuinely frightening performance!
1.0,1012928-m,Shot him like a mad dog!
1.0,1012928-m,Just never equaled. Peter Lorre's interpretation remains a must see. Absolutely no mistake in the staging. How is it one cannot stage and/or perform movies like that piece of art more than 80 years later
1.0,1012928-m,"Possibly one of the greatest films ever photographed. As always, I'm rendered speechless by Fritz Lang's modern cinematic vocabulary. Such an artist ahead of the curve, and by decades. Stunning cinema, even 80+ years later."
1.0,1012928-m,Gets better with each viewing.
1.0,1012928-m,My fourth favourite film of all time. Needs to be seen by all. Indescribable perfection.
1.0,1012928-m,Brilliant film. Explores the murders from a different perspectives good storyline. Great directing. Eerrily good.
1.0,1012928-m,"Fritz Lang's incredibly haunting and tragic murder-mystery is more emotionally and politically potent than the majority of films...period, to be frank, and it is only heightened by the lack of soundtrack."
1.0,1012928-m,masterpiece... nothing less.
1.0,1012928-m,"I was surprised at how little Lorre was in this until the end. The whole Mob vs. killer aspect was very interesting, and the ending is pretty great. Probably the darkest movie made for the next 30 years or so, really ballsy and powerful subject matter for an early sound movie."
1.0,1012928-m,cristoddio peter lorre me lo sogno stanotte.
1.0,1012928-m,Good example of film noir.A little slow at times but the story is thrilling.Peter Lorre is great here.
1.0,1012928-m,"Unquestionably one of the greatest pieces of cinema ever made, Fritz Lang's M is the blueprint for the modern murder mystery. Exquisitely shot, expertly written, and as suspenseful as any modern motion picture, M is a dark, groundbreaking noir thriller every film fanatic should see."
1.0,1012928-m,Fritz Langs landmark film is a masterpiece with a capital M. The cinematography and the atmosphere is just fantastic as well as the performances especially from Peter Lorre who is just phenomenal in his role. The ending scene belongs to some of the greatest scenes in cinema history.
1.0,1012928-m,Very interesting movie indeed! The dubious actions preformed by the lead actor (Peter Lorre) made me pop my monocle.

1.0,1012928-m,"A milestone psycho-thriller with striking cinematography, profound social views, and a great performance from Peter Lorre."
1.0,1012928-m,"This is Peter Lorre`s best performance. He is totally captivating in the pain he exudes as criminal who utterly detests his own crimes, yet there is nothing sympathetic about this pathetic character. Lorre plays this character as only he could... brilliantly!"
1.0,1012928-m,"Probably Fritz Lang's greatest film, and one of the best psychological thrillers i've ever seen. M is haunting, suspensful and it's complex story keeps you thinking throughout the entire movie. I highly recommend it."
1.0,1012928-m,Amazing Film...a German classic restored.
1.0,1012928-m,Throw such trashes like A Clockwork Orange straight to the dust bin where it should belong ha
1.0,1012928-m,"Clever, gripping, and emotional. M touches on more than simply murder, but the repercussions and reactions that are part of the process. An excellent film on the study of people and their thought process during a time of horror and hunting for the killer."

1.0,1012928-m,"One of the first psychological thrillers, and dare I say, the absolute best. One of the most powerful performances from Lorre and Franz Becker. Not to mention the STUNNING imagery, the best imagery from a murder/thriller at least. This is the epitome of German cinema."
1.0,1012928-m,"Both creepy and fascinatingly deep, ""M"" features some of the most memorable scenes to ever grace the world."
1.0,1012928-m,One of the best movies I have ever seen. Incredibly story arc and incredible performances all around. It is just ingenious at every turn. Hands-down one of the greatest films of all time.
1.0,1012928-m,Done unlike any other movie I have ever seen. Suspenseful entertaining with a totally different structure for plot. Peter Lorre pulls of desperation like no other.
1.0,1012928-m,Very good and interesting movie. Excellent especially for the time it was made.

1.0,1012928-m,"If your a serious lover of film it's one of those movies you just need to see. An early example of suspense, it's a tight thriller, with a message, given to us by Fritz Lang...he's kinda a big deal."

1.0,1012928-m,Timeless masterpiece that brilliantly attacks the increasing mob-rule politics of 30s Germany why also delivering an exciting serial killer thriller with a heist thrown into the mix!
1.0,1012928-m,all the town's criminals are tired of being constantly harassed by police because of a child killer on the loose. so they all get together to find him themselves. a cool premise and a very well done film
1.0,1012928-m,Fritz Lang's legendary picture is notable for its superb construction of fear and excitement...Peter Lorre gives a greatly ambiguous performance as the child killer that strikes fear in pre-war Berlin.
1.0,1012928-m,Innovative in it's use of sound. Peter Lorre gives a perfect performance - unfortunately it haunted the rest of his acting career
1.0,1012928-m,'M' is loaded with memorable images and a stillness in the sound gives us one of the rarest movie experiences of all time. Much thanks goes to Criterion for bringing back a lost and undisputed classic. The best foreign film ever made and it's tied with 'American Graffiti' as my favorite film.
1.0,1012928-m,Best film ever made.
1.0,1012928-m,The best film with a single letter for its title! It's also quite good apart from that.

1.0,1012928-m,"Absolutely masterful - dramatic, epic and controversial. Lang provides us with another masterpiece and this is a film everyone should see"
1.0,1012928-m,"An exceptionally well crafted thriller. It uses it's devices impeccably to both draw and blur the line between justice and vigilantism, understanding and sympathy, and the sickness in us all. A true cinematic classic."
1.0,1012928-m,"No wonder this movie is considered one of the best made in history. Fabulous acting, cinematography and plot. Wow."
1.0,1012928-m,"Flawless, totally. It took Hollywood always to catch up with films of this caliber (with the possible exception of ""All Quiet on the Western Front"")."
1.0,1012928-m,"Four years after his smash hit Metropolis, master of German Expressionism Fritz Lang premieres his first sound film, M. Lang uses sound in M not only as a key plot device, but also as a nod to classical music on which the story is based."
1.0,1012928-m,Fritz Lang's legendary picture is notable for its superb construction of fear and excitement...Peter Lorre gives a greatly ambiguous performance as the child killer that strikes fear in pre-war Berlin.
1.0,1012928-m,That whistle tune.....oh monstrosity.
1.0,1012928-m,"Considered as the finest work of Fritz Lang, M delicately profiles a wanted psychopath with stimulating themes and striking complexity that helplessly infects the audience with questions on justice and ethics. Remarkable."
1.0,1012928-m,"Ett m√§sterverk. Har inte sett den h√§r sedan filmkunskapen i gymnasiet slog det mig. Allt jag egentligen mindes var st√§mningen och Peter Lorres stora, r√§dda √∂gon. S√• det k√§ndes lite som att se den f√∂r f√∂rsta g√•ngen."
1.0,1012928-m,"Expertly made way ahead of its time, extremely chilling and expertly acted. The way it shows how tortured the murder is, and how everyone in the entire town is against him. Must see for any film fan."
1.0,1012928-m,I heard it's the first serial killer movie ever made and it's really interesting the see how the shocking appearance of this psychopath wreaks havoc among all the underworld. It has some remaining feeling and style from the silent movies... ;)
1.0,1012928-m,My favorite film by Fritz Lang. The film to lay down the psychological thriller formula for later generations.
1.0,1012928-m,"A truly dark thriller about the depths of the mind of a serial killer. This movie doesn't rely on violence to get its disturbing point across. It relies on the disturbing Franz Becker character, and its dark atmosphere."
1.0,1012928-m,"It may start a little slow, but man....this movie is pretty damn intense."
1.0,1012928-m,Lorre's finest role.
1.0,1012928-m,Peter Lorre's 1st and best role typecast him for life. He's a childkiller who can't help himself while Police and local criminals (whose activities are hurt by the Police search ) are searching for him. Peter's plea at the end when captured by the criminal element is unforgettable.
1.0,1012928-m,As good as any movie ever made.
1.0,1012928-m,"Amazing. When you consider how much of sound cinema appears to have been - if not invented, then - used so confidently by Lang in 1931, your jaw hits the floor. The story, the treatment, the tone... it's amazingly relevant. We have not come far in 80 years."
1.0,1012928-m,Is tha monster the worst?
1.0,1012928-m,"AWESOME movie! Highly recommended great classic movie, featuring a legend in acting, the fabulous Peter Lorre!! Rent it, download it, buy it - just see it SOON!"
1.0,1012928-m,Great Movie indeed. Peter Lorre performance as a child killer was on the mark. He played it as well as he possibly could in the 1930's. The movie is timeless each movie generation will love this work of art.
1.0,1012928-m,When I finished watching I found myself wondering...when was this filmed? A timeless classic.
1.0,1012928-m,Surprisingly modern with a vicious portrayal of a child hunter from Lorre.
1.0,1012928-m,As powerful a film now as it was 80 years ago
1.0,1012928-m,"Brilliant. The images really struck me, and the script as well. Although I may not have understood all the camera techniques, and some of Peter Lorre's acting reminded me a little too much of ""Arsenic and Old Lace,"" ultimately, it's all genius."
1.0,1012928-m,M.a.s.t.e.r.p.i.e.c.e.
1.0,1012928-m,One of the best movies ever made and like the best Noir ever. And the film is From my favorite director Fritz Lang. Whats not to like? It has an amazing story with all the amazing suspense. Not my kind of story but i really liked this

1.0,1012928-m,One of the best serial killer movies i have ever seen. This movie is shocking because you dont' expect these type of movies to have been made around in this time. I give it four out of four thumbs up.
1.0,1012928-m,A great performance from Peter Lorre. I love how subtle and yet poignant some of the most violent scenes are.
1.0,1012928-m,Very disturbing film which has lost none of its power over the years.

1.0,1012928-m,"Chilling, thought-provoking, timeless (mostly). Definitely recommended."
1.0,1012928-m,"Fritz Lang's first sound film certainly packs a punch! Peter Lorre is superb as murderer Hans Beckert and the strong supporting cast include colourful characters such as Safecracker and Dicke Lohmann (Tubby Lohmann). Of course, Fritz Lang's directing is faultless."
1.0,1012928-m,"I was blown away. I'm a bit speechless.  Many ideological debates go on in the film, but what makes the film so interesting is that it doesn't take sides in any of them."
1.0,1012928-m,Wow! An early talkie with an excellent sound design. The ability to use sound isn't taken for granted and becomes another character in the film.
1.0,1012928-m,"Lorre's most dramatic performance, and one of his best. If you're a fan of his don't miss this movie. It is both very artsy and very exciting."

1.0,1012928-m,Great ending. Amazing for it's time.
1.0,1012928-m,The first serial killer movie in movie history is simply amazing. This is a must see.
1.0,1012928-m,"Frightening, visually poetic, and haunting, M is a nightmare. The end contains some of the darkest humor you'll see on film, although it's also painfully sad. Lorre is fantastic, particularly in those final scenes."
1.0,1012928-m,Lately i 've been finding myself bored of writting reviews... This is a masterpiece anyway...

1.0,1012928-m,Excellent Fritz Lang classic thats nothing short of a masterpiece. Peter Lorre is outstanding as a child murderer. This film helped pave the way for films raging Hitchcock films to serial killer films. Its influence and brilliance is readily apparent throughout the film.
1.0,1012928-m,"80 years old, and still stands as one of the great crime suspense films ever made. That's said while ignoring all of the innovations that basically set the rules for making a sound film that are still in use today. If you haven't seen it, well, give it a watch already!"
1.0,1012928-m,A brilliantly paced and structured film. Lorre gives a fascinating performance.
1.0,1012928-m,A dark and relentless thriller that illustrates the mastery of Lang's directoral skills as well as the influence European directors held over the genre.

1.0,1012928-m,"""Will nicht, muss! Will nicht, muss!""  the prosecution scene at the end of the movie is really thought-provoking and well-shot. peter lorre does a good job in creating a repulsive, psychopathic killer as well, with spooky popping eyes.."

1.0,1012928-m,"Fritz Lang is the man, this is amazing! The trial of Peter Lorre's child murder, where he pleads with the criminals that he is compelled to commit his crimes whilst they commit theirs out of choice is one of the greatest scenes in cinema."
1.0,1012928-m,"So, movie ...what do you wanna be when you grow up?Fritz Lang's M!"
1.0,1012928-m,A great Masterpiece about a Child Murder who terrorize Berlin the Police who fail to catch him and the Ringbanden (Organized German Crime) who catch him it's a hillarious Parabel on Mass Hysteria
1.0,1012928-m,"I watched ""Metropolis"" and it was good. But this movie is genius. If you're gonna watch just one Fritz Lang movie in your life, watch ""M."""
1.0,1012928-m,"Although the film certainly shows its age in cinematography and editing (an obvious expectation), its strong script, along with Peter Lorre's excellent performance, drastically improve the overall impressive feel of the movie. (In other words, the film is dated, but still well-worth watching.)"
1.0,1012928-m,A masterpiece of paranoia and guilt.

1.0,1012928-m,"What does it say about a German movie made in the '30s that during the scenes depicting the governing officials discussing cracking down down on civilians in an effort to find the killer, all I could think about was September 12, 2001 through January 19, 2009?"
1.0,1012928-m,Le meilleur film que j'aie jamais vu. Tout s'enchaine a la perfection. De A a Z tout est parfait.

1.0,1012928-m,"Still trenchant, and Otto Wernicke plays the same character in ""Testament of Dr. Mabuse!"""
1.0,1012928-m,One of the earliest 'talk' films about a serial killer.. who kills kids! And you know what? It's one of the best ever. Brought to us by the same man who directed the ground-breaking 'Metropolis'.
1.0,1012928-m,A great film by Fritz Lang! One of my favorites
1.0,1012928-m,Fritz Lang's psychological crime-thriller about the desperate hunt for a child murderer is a brillant film full of suspense about vigilante justice versus law and order. A definite must-see.
1.0,1012928-m,Lang's confidence to make a movie at the start of talkies that still relied so heavily on silent passages showed what a master he was. German expressionism gave birth to film noir and much of that debt goes to Lang and this masterpiece.
1.0,1012928-m,This is my favorite film by silent-film god Fritz Lang. It's also ironically his first talkie. M is a masterpiece and one of the bleakest thrillers I've ever witnessed....Wow.
1.0,1012928-m,Eternal Masterpiece for the Ages...
1.0,1012928-m,"one of the top films from the 30's. shows restlessness in a town when police can't solve a crime, mob mentality takes over. witch hunts & false accusations run rampant. kids disappearing, parents can't let them out of their sight and everybody's losing their mind. it's just a great movie"
1.0,1012928-m,"A true cinematic masterpiece! On his first ""talkie"" film, Fritz Lang hits the nail on the head with this gripping story of intrigue and deception... and about finding morality in the darkest of places."
1.0,1012928-m,great german expressionist classic. The first film i ever analysed in my class in university. The first Lang talkie movie. I love the scene with balloon. A classic...one of my 100 top movie of all time.
1.0,1012928-m,This is a masterpiece! Looks like a modern film! Peter Lorre is terrific!!!
1.0,1012928-m,"I LOVE THIS FILM!!! Definitely one of the best in the history of cinema. The cinematography is incredible, and Peter Lorre's performance is flawless. M is an absolute masterpiece. Amazing!! A MUST-SEE before you die. ;)"
1.0,1012928-m,Classic expressionist film from Fritz Lang.
1.0,1012928-m,Amazing movie that is unusually dark even by today's standards. The suspense is stupendous! The use of sound is amazing. The court scene near the end is especially powerful. This movie is a masterpiece!
1.0,1012928-m,"Incredibly dark film for 1931, but it does reflect the tensions of the time. Fritz Lang did an amazing job with his first talkie."
1.0,1012928-m,Very few movies can grab you and hold on from the first moment. Yet M succeeds in griping on to you every time you watch it.
1.0,1012928-m,The best noir film ever made. Hands down.
1.0,1012928-m,"Masterpiece. Extremely well-done and eerie. Very ironic, especially the ending. Brilliant film"

1.0,1012928-m,"Amazing film, strange story. Great but bleak moral. A must see"
1.0,1012928-m,"All serial killer suspense movies owe everything to this movie. Okay, maybe that is a slight exaggeration but this is one of the best examples of the genre."
1.0,1012928-m,"The Quintessential masterpiece of German cinemma, because it is foreign my generation is missing out on this masterpiece"
1.0,1012928-m,"Seriously creepy, a landmark film."
1.0,1012928-m,cinematically fascinating. Fritz Lang used some shots that were not made popular until Citizen Kane (ten years later)!
1.0,1012928-m,"Fantastic movie and a great example of early sound cinema from Germany. The film deals not only with very dark issues, but also with the problem of retribution, which is just as prevalent today as it was in 1931."
1.0,1012928-m,"Probably one of the most significant films ever made, inspiring genres from serial killer to film noir. M stands for masterpiece and masterclass."

1.0,1012928-m,"For Fritz Lang's first ""talkie"" he is so far ahead of his time with the audio, even if some sound effects are missing, who cares? Sound plays a major role in the film. The opening scene breaks my heart. I like the negative portrayal of the police...but in the end, we can't say who's the bad guy."
1.0,1012928-m,"An amazing movie! It was iconic for its time, and the themes still resonate today. Peter Lorre pulls off a wonderful performance, and Fritz Lang puts you at the edge of your seat."
1.0,1012928-m,This is brilliant! It's a classic. Miami Vice even made an episode based on it. (My second husband was an extra in it.)
1.0,1012928-m,"Peter Lorre is a big baby of a man who murders children. Coupled with Lang's expressionist style, child murder never looked so cool"
1.0,1012928-m,The subtlety is scarier than seeing the gore!
1.0,1012928-m,The director Fritz Lang considered this terrifying and morally complex Masterpiece to be his finest work.
1.0,1012928-m,"Haunting, atmospherical and captivating german horror-crime tale, masterfully crafted by Fritz Lang and starring the ever mesmerizing and intriguing Peter Lorre."
1.0,1012928-m,amazing a masterpiece

1.0,1012928-m,Pretty much the best movie ever made.
1.0,1012928-m,Yes yes yes! If only actors were this emotive nowadays...all fakes I tell ya!
1.0,1012928-m,Fritz Lang's 1931 masterpiece about a child murderer who holds a city in a grip of fear has lost nothing of its effectiveness. It is the stuff nightmares are made of. It has been re-released this week on dvd. Don't miss it. This is far more than just cinema: this is revolution.

1.0,1012928-m,It always amazes me when you see a film made so long ago (77 years!) that still feels current. Some of the camera work is pretty impressive for its time as well. Loved Peter Lorre. Terrifying. Vile. Riveting.
1.0,1012928-m,Very well made. A very interesting story that has it's foundation in eerie truths. Lots of symbolism. The movie comes together very well. Great acting.
1.0,1012928-m,What a great movie.A film about a city getting crazy after several kids are kidnapped and murdered.And this is a film from 1931! - Just a year after films stopped being mute.Amazing!

1.0,1012928-m,"Golly, people in the thirties smoked alot! greatest serial killer movie ever."
1.0,1012928-m,"Who cares what I have to say, see the damn movie, it's worth your 2 hours to see this kind of filmmaking."
1.0,1012928-m,Amazing film. You nearly don't notice that it's a film from 1931. It's that exciting and suspenseful. And Lorre's fabulous.
1.0,1012928-m,"The first and still, so far BEST movie about a murderer ever made. Brilliant cinematography and amazing acting, put together by a genius director. A movie that should not be missed by anyone."
1.0,1012928-m,"Amazing cinematography, suspenseful storyline (not so much in not knowing the murderer but in what will happen next), and Peter Lorre's first starring role. Great movie."
1.0,1012928-m,Helluva story. Amazingly crafted. Incredible performances...way ahead of its time. Creepy as shit at times.
1.0,1012928-m,The great grand-daddy of all psycho thrillers!
1.0,1012928-m,Brilliantly directed thriller as both cops and underworld criminals hunt down a child killer in Berlin. Breathtaking cinematography plus Peter Lorre's unforgettable performance make this an absolute classic.
1.0,1012928-m,"The first, and best serial killer movie ever made. It hasn't aged one second since it came out."
1.0,1012928-m,"Three cheers for no protagonists, no winners, no trust, and no hope."
1.0,1012928-m,Amazingly good from the cinematography to the acting (Peter Lorre is terrific) to the shades-of-gray morality questions.
1.0,1012928-m,"Hands-down the most haunting film I've ever seen. Made two years before Hitler came to power, it is also a damning critique of Pre-war Germany."
1.0,1012928-m,"Un superbe film efficace, deroutant. Un film vu au lyc√©e que j'ai aime revoir plusieurs fois depuis."
1.0,1012928-m,An absolute masterpiece. As dark and creepy as they come.
1.0,1012928-m,"One the best classic movies ever made, a bit slow paced in the begginning, but gets sooo much better."
1.0,1012928-m,One of the best films I have ever seen.
1.0,1012928-m,A real thriller in time...is that past have passed?!!!
1.0,1012928-m,Lorre and Lang at their best
1.0,1012928-m,uno dei pi√π belli di sempre
1.0,1012928-m,"As creepy as movies come. And even creepier is the clarity of vision that Lang had in seemingly anticipating the rise to power of Hitler and the Nazi party.  Also Peter Lorre's best role: simultaneously sympathetic, pathetic, and horrifyingly evil."
1.0,1012928-m,"A very well though out movie that shows the proces of the police trying to catch a child killer. Very interesting concept, especially for that time period as it seemed as if movies were heavily cnesored at that time. A young Peter Lorre hives a great performance."
1.0,1012928-m,"Peter Lorry's ""mercy! Mercy!"" will forever rattle around in my mind. not often noted in film reviews, M is often sited by historians as a work of art that is meant to portray the dissatisfaction and angst in Wiemar Germany."
1.0,1012928-m,"Hands down my favorite film of all time. The writing, acting, directing was all incredible. This is Fritz Lang's haunting masterpiece. Visually stunning and way ahead of its time."
1.0,1012928-m,"One can see how the great Alfred Hitchcock was influenced by the equally great Fritz Lang by watching M. No need to actually FILM the act of violence; in M, less is much, much more. A fantastic film, and a true classic."
1.0,1012928-m,"There isn't much that can be said about this film that hasn't been said before. This is a grat, important film and I cannot recommend it highly enough."
1.0,1012928-m,"Peter Lorre's a badass, and so is Fritz Lang. I never thought watching a pedophile could be so fascinating. Awesome."
1.0,1012928-m,I wish I knew how to text an eerie whistle.
1.0,1012928-m,CLASSIC! Peter Lorre is amazing at the end! All the corridors and shots through doors really enhanced my empathetic view as everyone closed in around M!
1.0,1012928-m,one of the best movies ever made.
1.0,1012928-m,"The economy, austerity and directness of the films of Fritz Lang made him one of the most profound, and precise filmmakers."
1.0,1012928-m,"One of the best films ever made in any country. Lorre (in his pre-Casablanca/Maltese Falcon, ""Bug-eyed Creepy Guy"" typecasting days) gives the performance of a career and Lang invents cinematic tricks from whole cloth that are still being used 70 years later. ""M"" is for ""must see"""
1.0,1012928-m,Legendary but only in german
1.0,1012928-m,The beginnings of an expressive sound cinema...
1.0,1012928-m,"One of the creepiest movies ever made. Peter Lorre is brilliant as the compulsive child killer. It gets so bad that even the street gangs and mobsters start tryng to track him dowm. The ending with the criminals putting Lorre on ""tiail"" is brilliant"
1.0,1012928-m,An excellent portrayal of both the murderer's mind and the mob's reaction to the horrible events. Hauntingly beautiful camera work and Peter Lorre is amazing.

1.0,1012928-m,"This was Fritz Lang's first time using sound in film- that statement needs to be said because it is not seen. Lang is a master at his medium and proved it with his use of sound in the film, M. A breakthrough through all barriers."
1.0,1012928-m,Otra obra magistral de Fritz Lang. Uno de los temas m√É¬°s controverciales en cine mudo.
1.0,1012928-m,"I only watched partial from one of my class, but I already addicted to this movie."
1.0,1012928-m,"I can't stress how much I love this film, nor can I describe why in less than 500 words. If you haven't seen it, watch it."
1.0,1012928-m,"The first and one of the best movies about a serial murderer ever made. Though it is a German film, it's premise can be applied to any culture, and Peter Lorre is really unsettling in the role of the murderer."

1.0,on_the_waterfront,"Great. Just another reason to label Marlon Brando as one of the greatest actors ever.

1.0,1013139-maltese_falcon,A classic mystery. I got into this one and its twists and turns. Bogart is unparalled and Lorre and Greenstreet as usual hold powerful supporting roles. Mary Astor is the lady who dives back and forth and is a great force in this film. I highly reccommend Maltese Falcon

1.0,1002352-big_sleep,The greatest 40's film noir mystery film by Howard Hawks. Every time I watch this film I get something more out of it every time. Great memorable scenes and definitely one of Bogarts best films.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,The chemistry between Bogart and Bacall is overshadowed only by the witty dialogue.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"A brilliant, if sometimes complicated, story of private eye Phillip Marlowe played by Bogart. Bacall co-stars. This is a classic 40s film noir, and I highly recommend it."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,THE BIG SLEEP (1946)
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Uppos viel√§ paremmin kun muutama vuosi sitten. Amerikkalaista elokuvaa parhaimmillaan. Uskomaton tunnelma. Loistavaa teksti√§, samalla tavalla ei ole hahmojen luonteita esitelty muissa filmeiss√§. Bogart ja Bacall - ehk√§ valkokankaan paras pari."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,One of Best Movies of All time and Humphrey Bogart is the Man
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"I have to admit, I still have no idea if the plot makes sense to me or not, but the movie is so atmospheric and the chemistry is so strong between Bogie and Bacall (obviously) that I've come to the conclusion that I don't really care if it makes sense or not."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Noir, another dead film genre. Maybe it's for the best, I don't think modern Hollywood is capable of making something this good."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Bogart is classic and as always Bacall plays off him so damn well a true classic
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Its nearly impossible to hate a movie featuring Bogart,and it gets even better,knowing that Howard Hawks directed it! An incredibly underrated film."
0.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Unbelievable characters and poor acting make this noir-esque romp a pile of rubbish. Especially when compared to say, 'The Maltese Falcon'."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Fucking brilliant. One of the landmark Film Noirs out there. Bogart does some of his best work in this film and the scenes between him and Bacall are excellent. Also one of the most badass Bogart fights happens in this one.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"The Big Sleep is the definition of a Film Noir. While it has a overly complicated plot, the screen chemistry between Bogy and Becall is the reason to watch, mainly the scenes where the dialogue goes above and beyond acting."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Brilliant stuff. Full review later.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Brilliant stuff. Full review later.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"One of the most perfect prototype detective movies. Sure the story is a little muddled, but we'll blame that on Raymond Chandler."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Nevermind how convoluted the plot is. The chemistry between the two leads is palpable, with deliciously ambiguous dialogues and latent sexuality. One of the many Hawks' masterpieces."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"One of the greatest Film Noirs of all time. With great suspense, quotable dialogue and an unforgetable chemistry between the leads (Humphery Bogart and Lauren Bacall), the Big Sleep is living proof that they don't make them like they use t"
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,My favorite so far of the noir genre.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"One of the best, not fully recognized, movies of all time with a stunning, talented cast. The chemistry on screen between Bogart and Becall has all been lost in today's movies. Whenever I have a bad day, The Big Sleep is rated up there with Ben and Jerry's and a soft pillow."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Great movie from the great Howard Hawks starring the equally great pairing of Bogart and Bacall. In general the film benefits from a great cast with Martha Vickers standing out most among the supporters. A real classic of a film which should be sought after by all fans of movies.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Yes its black and white, I'm not sure that you can beat the writing!!"
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Baserad p√• Raymond Chandlers b√§sta roman och med Bogart i sin enda film som Philip Marlowe (han borde gjort fler), med hans fru Lauren Bacall. Kemin mellan dem √§r elektrisk, precis som i deras f√∂rsta m√∂te p√• vita duken i Att ha och inte ha."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Don't try to understand what's going on.Just enjoy it.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Bogey and Bacall don't get any better than this one!
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Fantastic detective noir.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Lauren Bacall's debut film -- very fun adventure.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Bogart and Bacall practically sizzle in this film. And Howard Hawks tells a fantastic detective story on top of that. Truly one of the all time greats.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,My #1 movie of all time. Bogart and Bacall at their best. Complicated story with lots of twists and turns. One of a very select few movies that I watch over and over again.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"The plot ceases to make sense at some point, but frame by frame and scene for scene the frisson, the humor, the coolness add up to a Bogie-Bacall and Howard Hawks masterwork."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,One of the greatest movies I've ever had to the privilege to enjoy.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Classic noir film. No wasted dialogue, very witty and loaded with double entendres. Plot is convoluted, but adds to the intrique of the movie. Bogart and Bacall never better. Unresolved murder unusual for those days."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Excellent script, perfect performances, and very very intriguing."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"""You know how to whistle, don'tcha Steve? You just put your lips together and blow."""
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Fantast beyond film noir.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Bogie was cool. Chandler's insanely clever dialogue was kept pretty well intact. Great Noir. What's not to like?
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"My favorite of all the hard-boiled noirs, Bogart here shows how truly great screen actors can get across an entire character in a single gesture and knowing grin."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Tremendous entertainment with one of the most convoluted plots ever in a Hollywood movie - even the writer admitted he didn't know who committed one murder! But who cares with this lightning pace and great dialouge.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"The direction, music, cinematography, screenplay and performances are all flawless, and make for one of the best film noirs ever made."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Classic B&B;! A must see on a dark and foggy night like tonight!
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"This is amazing. I got really confused sometimes as to what was going on, but it's great. And the dialogue's awesome! lol If you watch it or have watched it, you KNOW what I mean!"
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Great movie. Totally amazing. I love Bogart and Bacall, especially before they got married when they starred in The Big Sleep and To Have and Have Not, which I have not seen yet. It is wonderful. I recommend it to all!"
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Great movie. Totally amazing. I love Bogart and Bacall, especially before they got married when they starred in The Big Sleep and To Have and Have Not, which I have not seen yet. It is wonderful. I recommend it to all!"
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"First of all, I absolutely love Bogart. Everything I've seen with him so far has been gold, and this is certainly no exception. Very witty, loved it!"
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Bogart and Bacall; directed by Howard Hawks; Scripted by William Faulkner. What's not to like, right? Convoluted plot, that's what, but hey, you're having so much fun in the noir genre you don't even care. Seminal film noir classic."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Classic film noir - love it
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Another darn good Bogart film. Not as good as the Maltese Falcon but still great.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,The chemistry between these two makes my toes curl. whew
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,I loved this movie! It's very suspenseful throughout! The story is good and the characters are interesting and lovable. Plus you can't go wrong with Bogie and Bacall!
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,the dialogue is perfect and so is lauren bacall.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,One of my favorite movies and probably one of the best noir films of all time.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,best film noir movie EVER
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,One of the essential film noir
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"This is a true classic. The plot is both riveting and ridiculously complex, the dialogue is razor sharp and, of course, its got Humphrey Bogart, who is the epitome of cool."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Brilliant. Smart and funny dialogue and an excellent cast really help this detective story come to life. Just make sure you pay attention to what is going on.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Absolutely one of my favorites. Bogart and Bacall actually reshot one of the scenes a year later having been married in the interim. Some of the plot is so convoluted as to be incomprehensible. Somehow it all suits the noir underpinnings and carries me away. I love it and watch it time and again.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"a film noir masterpiece, Bogart and Bacall are electric. Wonderful, Wonderful dialouge one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,for me the best Bogart/ Bacall movie
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,no one knows who killed whom in the end because everything is so confusing...but worth watching for things not connected with logic!
0.0,1002352-big_sleep,One of the most boring film noir films I've ever seen.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"The Greatest Dialogue ever! Bogart mysterious and too cool, Bacall is smooth"
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Le chef-d'oeuvre du film noir.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Someone killed someone, and then more people are killed. Something, something. Guy gets girl in the end."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Bogart is fantastic in this Film Noir classic.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Noir contorto, ma stupendo sia per gli attori che per i dialoghi, che non sembrano essere stati scritti negli anni '40.Bogart idolo!!!"
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"One of the greatest of all films noir. Bogart is brilliant. Bacall was never a great actress but no one can doubt the chemistry between the two leads. Raymond Chandler's convoluted plot leaves everybody guessing, but the dialogue is scintillating and the performances top notch."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"- This has to be one of the greatest film characters ever. Although I would never call Bogart an amazing actor he completely owns this type of role. The script is phenomenal, the direction is great.. this is Film Noir at its finest. Howard Hawk is a pimp"
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"and the tears flowed like wine... maybe the best Hawks (favorite might go to His Girl Friday, but it's very close); Bogie and Bacall are quintessentially awesome here, as is the script which synthesizes classic Chandler with classic Hollywood noir"
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Can't go wrong with this... Meow
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,definately the best movie they ever did together
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"I barely understand the plot. The plot, however, doesn't matter at all. It's all about Bogart being Bogart, Bacall being Bacall, and me loving every minute of it."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Jeg skulle se den tre-fire gange f√∏r jeg forstod plottet (jeg tror, jeg har det nu), som b√•de er indviklet og med spring i handlingen, men hey: fantastisk stemning, eminente replikker og Bogart i sin glansrolle som privatdetektiv Marlowe."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Bogart & Bacall sizzle.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Great adaptation of the book, given the sex and drug references had to be toned down back in the day. Best scene: Bogie & Bacall on horse racing. ""GRRARRR!"""
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"As classic as classic gets; the chemistry between Bogart and Bacall is unparalleled in film history. Casablanca is rightfully famous, but this is Bogart's finest... Words can't do it justice - just watch it..."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Saw it on our honeymoon on the big screen at the British Film Institute on the south bank.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"You have 2 daughters, both pretty - and both pretty wild!Bogart best actor ever!"
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Film noir at its absolute best.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Oh my gawd, Bogie is so sexy in this movie. Dialogues are great, Bogart's character is the coolest ever, the plot is awesome, and the chemistry between Bogart and Bacall is amazing!!! This movie totally met and went beyond my expectation."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Howard Hawks directing Bogart and Bacall in a Raymond Chandler adaptation-- you can't get much better when it comes to film noir. The plot is a bit convoluted, but the witty banter, snappy character confrontation, and fast pace more than make up for plot holes."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Soooo sexy and cool!
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Howard Hawks and Humphrey Bogart making a noir? I really can't see at what point this would have gone wrong. The plot is indecipherable, but that's okay, plots are peripheral, anyway."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"My very favorite classic noir. Chandler's convuluted plot, difficult to understand even in the original book, is impossible to follow here; still, I enjoyed every hard-boiled minute."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,El mejor Film Noir de la historia. Una obra de arte que solo se podia hacer en blanco y negro!!! Excelente casting. Excelente vestuario.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Bogart isn't stereotypically good looking, but he ""sure has something"" as they used to say. Throughout this film women just fall at his feet (literally in one case) and you can definately see why. The plot is labrynthine, but the acting and screen writing is classic era Hollywood at its very best."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Bogey and Bacall have breathtaking chemistry in this marvellous Howard Hawkes adaptation of Raymond Chandler's novel. It has the wittiest, most sparkling dialogue and best screenplay you'll ever come across - courtesy of William Faulkner and is a noir masterpiece."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Although the finished plot can be tough to follow, this is an amazing film. Bacall and Bogart are truly amazing together. Their banter alone is worth seeing the movie for."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Bogart just really didn't make too many bad films. Great movie. The remakes aren't a patch on this. Nobody does it like Bogart...
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"A masterpiece of noir, even though we never know who killed the chauffer..!"
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"The best film noir in my opinion. Many people prefer The Maltese Falcon, but for me the best film noir is The Big Sleep. All the actresses are gorgeous, great mystery and it's a movie that works beautifully on black and white!"
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"The acting, dialog, Hawks's rapid direction and the chemistry between Bogart and Bacall all add up to something greater than the sum of its parts. The plot is so twisty that even the filmmakers couldn't explain why one of the murder victims was killed. But that's part of the picture's charm."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,I love the way Lauren Bacall flares her nostrils. Great dialogue.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Crime noir meets Bogie. Chandler's hero in both the 1945 pre-release with the more linear storyline and the 1946 version with all the smoldering Bogart and Bacall footage. A landmark.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Classic Bogart and Bacall flick
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Wow! It's as good as Raymond Chandler's book. That's because the screenplay is by another great American writer, William Faulkner.  Humphrey Bogart is cast perfectly as Philip Marlowe. The rest of the cast is great too."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"great story, great actors the way movies should be."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Smouldering chemistry rises from the greatest screen couple of all time in the definitive film adaptation of Chandler's greatest novel. On top of that, great script, acting and directing! Masterclass!"
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Bogart is a bad ass as usual. The banter between him and Bacall is so witty and amusing. A must watch for Bogie fans!
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,One of the best films ever made!

1.0,1002352-big_sleep,bogey and bacall sizzle
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,There is no dick like Marlowe! and there is no Marlowe like Bogart
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"After countless viewings AND reading the book, I still couldn't tell you what happened. As The Big Sleep will attest, who needs a plot when you have atmosphere, attitude, drug-addled teenage nymphomaniacs, and one of the greatest couples in history?"
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"The Big Sleep is a stylish ""Film Noir"" with a fast paced and confusing plot. However, the sharp dialogue and strong chemistry between Bogart and Bacall will make this a hugely enjoyable experience, whether you understand it or not."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,You simply won't find a better script!
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"The story is a bit confusing, and it is too long, but for only the sparks between Bacall and Bogart, and the ending, this is a great film."

1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"It doesn't make sense, but it doesn't matter."

1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"So far, my favorite noir film. Bogart and Bacall are, of course, amazing. The witty dialog is fast, furious, and fantastic."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Don't even try to follow the plot, just sit back and enjoy the fantastic dialogue and sizzling chemistry of Bogart and Bacall."

1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Wonderful, beautiful, perfect. Everything you could want from a film"
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,A classic of film noir. Some great sarcastic dialog.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Awesome! Both the 1945 and 1946 versions leave me wanting more. ""Doghouse"" Marlow is one of my favorite movie characters of all time. He's tough, smart, and intrigues the females. This film has action, suspense, and drama all mixed in one glass. Another classic brought you by the great Howard Hawks."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,The way Bogart talks to women is awesome.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,The best Bogart film? It has my vote.

1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Much more enjoyable than Maltese Falcon
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Classic film noir son. Don't sleep or you'll lose the plot.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Incredible. The prototypical detective movie...they don't get any better.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Hawks made it as twisted and pointless as the novel: perfect. W/out which, would we have all these Coen Bros movies? Probably not."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Probably the greatest film noir ever, definitely the best of Bogie and Bacall which says something! Also the best adaptation of Raymond Chandler. Everyone should see this movie."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"It's a great film noir with fantastic dialogue. The plot is confusing, but you can understand the gist of it."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,I love this film. But don't ask me to tell you what it's about.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,One of the absolute best!
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Bogarts almost as crazy as the bad guy! Extraordinary chemistry between Bogart and Bacall.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"The best hard boiled detective film ever. Bogart is badass throughout and Bacall is his equal in all respects. This is the best of Noir films, and everyone should see it at some point."

0.0,1002352-big_sleep,It lived up to it's name.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Perhaps the best adaptation of a Raymon Chandler book committed to screen, helped i guess by him working on the script. Bogart and Bacall sizzle and lets face it all us guys would like to be as harnosed and arrogant as Marlow and still get the dame. Noir and classic."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,You want good on-screen chemistry? look no further than Bogart and Bacall. This is one of the better movies where they are opposite one another. It's also a much better Bogart-as-detective story than The Maltese Falcon.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,The King and Queen of effortless cool...if only i looked as good in a hat as Bogart

1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Possibly one of the best Noir movies ever.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,The performance by Bogie and Bacall is so incredible and sizzling that you forget how fucking convoluted the plot was.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Classic detective story with two of Hollywoods heavy weights from the 1940s, the film drips with style and pinache."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"One of the classics. Bogart completely defines coolness in this must-see film noir. Bacall... toughness, feminity and talent."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,bogie and lauren bacall are absolutely fantastic.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"One of the greatest pieces of noire in history. Bogart plays Marlowe to the letter in this tale of Bullets,Broads and numerous Betrayls. Chandler's fiction will never see a greater adaptation."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"The chemistry between Bogey and Bacall is truly amazing in this film. Plus, the plot is so much nicer. One of my favorites."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,The coolest movie of all time.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,You want to know what film noir is? This is film noir!!!
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,A shining example of the best of noir. Bogart plays an excellent badass with plenty of excellent one-liners sprinkled throughout. The plot is intriguing and the characters are compelling up to the last frame. It's a shame this movie doesn't get the full credit it deserves.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Another candidate for ""best noir movie ever""."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,My favorite movie of all time.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"This is one of my favourite movies. Bogart and Bacall just sizzle, the dialogue is great, and the plot keeps moving. Classic detective movie. This one set the standard very high. A must see for all fans of classic film."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,One of my all-time favorites for sure. They dont' make movies like this anymore.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Boggie and Becal at their steamiest. Hawks has produced a masterful albeit an esoteric noir.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Bogart and Becall. What a team they make. This is my favorite movie with them together. It is very suspenseful and involving.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Undoubtedly confusing film, with more twists than an out of work showgirl's last pair of stockings... but extraordinary for its slick self assurance, dazzling repartee, and the unmistakeable chemistry between Bacall and Bogart."
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,one of my favorites. bogart=god
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,lauren bacall is my favorite. she = real woman.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,If I've ever wanted to be some body else it's Bogart. On my best days I couldn't smoke that many cigarettes and drink that much whiskey.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Boggy as a private dick hired not by Bacall as stated in the Flixster review but by her father. Sex, pornographic pictures, drugs and guns...1946 movie ahead of its time. Cool and dark"
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,Probably my favorite Bogart film... and Bacall is awesome in it as well; a refinement on To Have and Have Not. Non-stop dry humor and a pretty wild plot make this a must-see film noir film.
1.0,1002352-big_sleep,"Film Noir is the best genre of all time, and this is the best film noir movie, no matter what people say. Plus Humphrey Bogart is the manliest man of all"
1.0,short_term_12_2013,"A film like Short Term 12 restores my faith in the industry. Wonderful story, and an excellent cast to carry out the difficult task of conveying such a troubling topic. Hands down the best movie I have seen in years. This is what I look for in moviemaking."
0.0,short_term_12_2013,The opening was crass and the filming and acting reminded me of a documentary done by a high school student. Pathetic. I could only watch it for 10 minutes.
1.0,short_term_12_2013,"Masterfully balances the multiple stories, in conjunction with the powerful performances by the entire cast."
1.0,short_term_12_2013,To put it simple :(1) one of the greatest movies i have ever seen(2) one of the most underrated movies to ever exist(3) Brie Larson : one of the best performances I have ever seen
1.0,short_term_12_2013,Easily my favorite movie.

1.0,whiplash_2014,"Simmons seems like a lock for best supporting actor. So much versatility in this film. He's horrendous, relatable, foul mouthed, and somehow sympathetic. Great film, the music is extraordinary, especially because of Miles Teller's drumming ability."

1.0,whiplash_2014,"This movie felt like an action movie but it wasn't, maybe it was just it being so intense. I didn't know that J.K Simmons could act so well and Miles Teller also did good as well but not as good. This movie shows how hard some people will go to accomplish extraordinary things."

1.0,whiplash_2014,"Young & old, precision and technique needs to be clear the way it's meant to be played hitting the right tune, rythm, beat, and sound. Time has changed, but not our taste in good music. The culture of music is within the player and players prior to them."

1.0,1000013-12_angry_men,"With superb acting and on-point direction, this movie flows with intensity that will have you glued to the screen. As each character breaks down their reasons for doubt, the uncouth and savage build up to the end is truly what makes this a perfect film that remains a flawless, cinematic gem."

1.0,1000013-12_angry_men,"This masterpiece was Sidney Lumet's first foray into directing and what a debut it was.

1.0,hidden_figures,"Heartwarming and powerful. I only wish that there wasn't the pain of knowing that, 60 years later, we should be much further along than we are."
1.0,hidden_figures,"Should be compulsory viewing; especially for young people. Brilliant performances from the lead women, the production values are stunning and it is incredibly moving. I wanted to jump up and pump my fist in the air more than once. Go and see it!"
1.0,hidden_figures,"We really are making progress, even if at times it seems frustratingly slow."
1.0,hidden_figures,"Completely inspirational and done in a very understated yet compelling manner. A great and true story, and a wonderful cast. As someone who grew up during the space race years, it was especially interesting to remember how caught up we all were, even as children, in the events of these days."
1.0,hidden_figures,"It felt like a story that needed to be told, not sure if that makes sense. Watch it and see for yourself."

1.0,hidden_figures,Rarely does a film bring out the humanity within us the way Hidden Figures does.
1.0,hidden_figures,"Outstanding! Just outstanding. The racial story, the science story and the American story merge beautifully. This show is not to be missed. The treatment of blacks will make you cringe throughout, but it is a great story of dedication and hard work."
1.0,hidden_figures,One of the best movies I've seen!
1.0,hidden_figures,A fantastic story of African women in NASA who helped us get to the moon.

1.0,hidden_figures,Really awesome show. It inspires how people coming together to solve problems regardless of race can truly make history happen.
1.0,hidden_figures,"Wonderful, uplifting movie! Makes you appreciate the long struggle that Blacks have faced in the past and present. Also a must see for women of any skin tone. It shows how far we have come, but that we still have quite a way to go to break through the glass ceiling."
1.0,hidden_figures,My 2nd favorite movie of 2016. I was just so sad it took over 50 years to tell this fantastic true story of the brilliant women that helped put the US into space. Highly highly recommend it.
1.0,hidden_figures,"Love this movie! Great acting, inspirational story! Very well-done!"
1.0,hidden_figures,I really enjoyed the movie. It's nice to learn about unknown people who did a lot for this country to make things better and to help other generations learn. It was nice to see some racial tension grow to a level of some comfort for those who weren't comfortable.

1.0,hidden_figures,"It's just a damn good movie. Space, struggles and pain, and success."

1.0,hidden_figures,"Best Film Oscar for Hidden Figures 2017.I've really enjoyed all the oscar nominated films - but this film stands out as the clear winner.

1.0,arrival_2016,"It might not seem like much, but ends up delivering much more than expected. Complies and goes that extra mile sci Fi is meant to accomplish. It is a ""must"" (a very enjoyable and EMOTIOnal one) for all sci Fi true lovers."
1.0,arrival_2016,"A near-perfect movie that deals with science, humanity, warfare, family, and the concept of time, but ultimately leaves the question of life and its meaning to the audience. If laser guns against monster aliens are your thing, go see ""Independence Day: Resurgence"" instead."
1.0,arrival_2016,Nothing like a good Ol' fashioned alien movie to make you appreciate your family.
1.0,arrival_2016,Best ever!! Let's your brain fell useful.

1.0,arrival_2016,Great film: atmospheric and haunting. The denouement is very satisfying. I bought Ted Chiang's book and read it after watching. Great job!

1.0,arrival_2016,It tells a story about communication.

1.0,arrival_2016,What a wonderful film. I was a bit confused at the beginning but my confusion was cleared up by the ending. This is by far the best Science Fiction is recent years. Highly recommend for any one who likes a thought provoking story instead of the special effect driven crap that we usually get.
0.0,arrival_2016,Good cast. Horrible movie. Couldn't understand half of the dialog. Long periods of no dialogue at all. Totally confusing. Kept using previous scenes. Don't waste your time.
1.0,arrival_2016,"I gave this movie 5 stars and it definitely deserves it. When the end came around, it gave the movie a whole new spin! This is a movie I could watch over and over again. I highly recommend it!"

1.0,arrival_2016,"An absolutely excellent film. I went in with no expectations and was blown away by the mood, concepts and the captivating central character."
1.0,arrival_2016,"Finally saw this. Had seen some negative reviews which kind kept me from watching it. Honestly may be my favorite 2016 movie now. Definitely not an action movie, but such a smart thoughtful experience from beginning to end."
1.0,arrival_2016,"Holy crap!! You need to watch it for yourself. It may start slow, but adding the pieces of the plot together along with the characters leads to a fulfilling ending."
1.0,arrival_2016,Seen in cinema- excellent!
0.0,arrival_2016,Awful. Turned it off after. 15-20 min

0.0,arrival_2016,"So...""Arrival"" was basically the 2007 Sandra Bullock movie ""Premonition"" combined with ""Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind."" Cinematically, it was pretty. Story/Plot-wise, it was predictable and boring. I fell asleep watching it."
1.0,arrival_2016,Good for what ails us right now

1.0,arrival_2016,"Amazing movie, exactly what I want from sci-fi"
0.0,arrival_2016,"Worst movie since ET. Amy Adams is helpless and hopeless. People act in completely unrealistic ways that make no sense. ""Then a miracle occurs"" is the premise of the move."
1.0,arrival_2016,"Made me think. The ideas were intriguing, and there was kind of a plot twist / surprise in the end. A little formulaic about the reactionary nature of humans (or maybe just realistic). I loved the idea that time is nonlinear. And I want to meet those aliens!"
1.0,arrival_2016,Very well done. Amy Adams is perfect. Best Sci-fi movie since Contact.
1.0,arrival_2016,Give it all the praise!!! Amazing movie
1.0,arrival_2016,"Both Villenveuve and Adams are at their best here. Visually and emotionally stunning. I am, and always will be, dumbfounded that Adams did not receive more recognition for her role in bringing this story to life. The character work and use of misdirection is peak storytelling."
1.0,arrival_2016,WOW this is truly a SFX masterpiece!!
1.0,arrival_2016,"A smart, expertly paced and acted sci-fi thriller. Arrival, once again, proves director Denis Villenueve is one of the modern masters of our time.5/5 stars"

1.0,arrival_2016,Great acting and a great story! The plot twist at the end is one of the best I've seen in a long time! A must see for Sci Fi fans!
1.0,arrival_2016,This is a special movie. It's not an action movie. It's not a thriller. Its not singular. It's nothing so pigeon-holed. It's f-ing smart. It's beautiful. It's masterfully crafted. Stop reading this. Go watch it.
1.0,arrival_2016,Imagine the thrill of Close Encounters combined with the awe and wonder of 2001 A Space Odyssey. Director Dennis Villeneuve and Writer Eric Heisserer are now at the top of my list of favorite directors and writers.
1.0,arrival_2016,Sublime. Perfectly executed and a fascinating look at perceptions if reality.
1.0,arrival_2016,"I am generally not a fan of science fiction or thrillers, but Amy Adams successfully helms this excellent film that questions our pre-conceived notions of what science fiction really can be."

0.0,arrival_2016,"What a waste of my time, confusing and utterly stupid. WTF is what came to mind at the end. I only watched all of the movie waiting for something to tie together, never did. Had lots of questions that were never answered, just like tv show Lost."
1.0,arrival_2016,I think this is a beautiful movie
1.0,arrival_2016,A well-executed science fiction thriller that also carries a thought-provoking concept down to its structural core.
0.0,arrival_2016,"Best movie by far to fall asleep to! Other than that...overrated, boring, and nothing special. Wish I never saw this movie. What a waste of time and money."
1.0,arrival_2016,Enjoyable sci-fi quasi-thriller with some familiar themes from Contact.
1.0,arrival_2016,"Incredibly powerful movie, a true ""statement of the human condition"".This story is a Shakespearean Tragedy masquerading as a sci-fi movie. That it didn't win multiple academy awards is shameful."
0.0,arrival_2016,Normally I agree with the tomatometer and audience score. I found this the most boring movie I have seen in a long time. I actually watched it to the end in the hope that it would redeem itself but no luck on that front.
1.0,arrival_2016,my favorite film <3
0.0,arrival_2016,"Incredibly pretentious. This is a ""chick flick"" disguised as sifi. The style is ridiculously slow. The concept of the aliens was very good, but the interesting part of the movie, how to understand language was skipped over. Silly movie how it got 94% ratings from the pros is a head scratcher."
1.0,arrival_2016,"Thoughtful, emotional and very moving. Something we all think about but can't quite fathom the logistics of meeting intelligent life outside of our own. Amy Adams shines."
1.0,arrival_2016,"Loved this movie, the plot was so brilliant and i feel like it desserved more awards."
1.0,arrival_2016,An absurdly good contact movie made with believe communication and an incredibly dense plot. One you'll want to pay very close attention to.
1.0,arrival_2016,Inspiring! Stunning sound effects.
1.0,arrival_2016,For once a symbolic story that goes against the typical vilified alien invasion type plot. A beautiful message linking advance communication and precognition skills. One of the most emotionally driven sci-fi movies of all time.
0.0,arrival_2016,"Slow, stupid plot, ridiculous ending what a waste of timeWorst movie of 2016"
0.0,arrival_2016,What a confusing mess. This movie was loaded with suspense...and then had zero pay off. This movie is easily one of the biggest wastes of time I've seen.

1.0,arrival_2016,A fantastic movie that makes you think. Really beautifully done.
1.0,arrival_2016,A masterclass science fiction that takes multiple viewings to truly appreciate and understand.
1.0,arrival_2016,"Not only looks great, but remains grounded, sustaining a very human and emotional element to the science fiction genre, having a spirit all of its own."
1.0,arrival_2016,"One of my 3 wishes, which for some reason extend to all humanity is to give everyone a common language so 'lost in translation' ceases to exist. This movie shares my desire, thought provoking and beautifully acted."

1.0,arrival_2016,One of my favourite movies of all time. Amazing. Moving.
0.0,arrival_2016,"I liked the timing and the main topic of the movie. But, the movie proceeds so slowly until the point that it was driving me crazy. I think the exact same plot with exact same acting quality could be done, half the time that this movie took (which is 111 minutes)."
0.0,arrival_2016,"The more I reflect on it, the worse it gets."
1.0,arrival_2016,"This movie is a masterpiece. Every line and every scene is significant and very well though/planned out. The subject matter was brilliant as well, communication...it shines a light on just how complicated it is. This is the best movie I have seen in recent memory."

1.0,arrival_2016,Fantastic. A Must see.
1.0,arrival_2016,"Arrival is something different to the other sci-fi movies, it¬¥s more focus on comunication and inteligence of the humans than the aliens. Amy Adams is amazing so as the story that it will blow your mind at the third act of the movie"

1.0,arrival_2016,couldn't take my eyes off the screen. the atmosphere of this movie is truly captivating.
0.0,arrival_2016,Not sure how this show got 93%! Was all excited to see it and boy was it a waste of time. First 45 minutes shear boredom. It was so dark I could hardly see each scene. Could have been so much better. Wish I could get me money back. Human Human Human ink blot ink blot octopus are now aliens!
1.0,arrival_2016,"A really good movie. Im a smart person but I don't know if I'm smart enough for this movie. I really liked it, not one I'll buy but one I'll watch when ever its on to try and better understand it."
1.0,arrival_2016,A tour-de-force. Equally riveting and revitalizing as it is meditative and poetic in its exploration of humanity.
0.0,arrival_2016,This was easily the worst movie I have seen in a while. The boring drawn out plot that had such a poor careless ending. I literally would put this movie on any time you're having insomnia as it is guaranteed to remedy that issue. It only deserves 93% as sleeping medicine. Absolutely awful flim
1.0,arrival_2016,"One of the most underated movies of 2016. An amazing original story, great cast and cinematography. But the music waa on another level. The actors did not have to speak, the music told the whole story."
0.0,arrival_2016,"One of the most boring ""aliens come to earth"" movies I have ever seen. The plot is also implausible and forced. Other than some of the visual effects, the film is unwatchable."
1.0,arrival_2016,"Simply marvelous. Excellent script, actors, everything was amazing"
1.0,arrival_2016,It's not really a complex movie it's pretty easy to understand...it's just meh. Starts strong then gets a tad slow for a hour then gets going last 20 mins. Not really a great story but does make you think about what if you knew your future.
1.0,arrival_2016,Smart sci-fi for adults.
0.0,arrival_2016,Quit possibly one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time
1.0,arrival_2016,Never thought I'd see a movie so thoughtful about Squid aliens and language. But I couldn't be happier about it.
1.0,arrival_2016,A total tear jerker!
1.0,arrival_2016,"Though you will see plenty of nods to past sci fi films and plenty of re-hashed themes, Arrival amply creates an amazing thought provoking sci fi with human morality. Amy Adams is on top of her game once again and once you fully grasp the film and its heady concept, you will be blown away."

0.0,arrival_2016,Nothing happens. Aliens come to save humanity in hopes that one day humanity will save them. One woman is the key and saves both. Aliens leave. The end. No action. Incredibly slow. Nothing to engage the audience. Would never recommend to anyone.

1.0,arrival_2016,The GOOD movie from 2016 about Amy Adams and aliens the government doesn't quite trust. Arrival is smart and stays smart all the way to the end rather than just turning into a CGI action movie in the third act like a lesser movie would have. The twist is great and it makes you think.
1.0,arrival_2016,"Wow... this movie was basically perfect for me. Great sci fi (my writing passion), linguistics (my education), smart story, & an almost gut wrenching finale when the truth comes together & my mouth is left gaping from the mind-blowing outcome. Phenomenal movie."

1.0,vertigo,"Hitchcock expertly tells a story about distance, the deep yearning for a connection that is too far away to obtain and is further shrouded by fears and former obligations. The viewer too feels this great longing long after the credits rolls."

1.0,vertigo,"Surreal feeling and elusive, one of my favourite elements of Vertigo is it's hypnotic approach to direction, which takes a decent (yet ordinary) mystery and makes it seem strangely dreamlike. Combined with an outstanding script, cast and score this is easily one of the greatest thrillers ever."
1.0,vertigo,"Erotically charged and beautifully surreal, Hitchcock's Vertigo is perhaps his best film if only because the melodrama doesn't fall short of the mystery, the two are marvelously combined to create a thrilling and suspenseful mystery and a haunting meditation on love and evocation of the unearthly."
1.0,vertigo,"Vertigo is an atmospheric, thought-provoking psychological thriller that meditates on the concepts of true love and unrestrained obsession."
1.0,vertigo,Fantastic stories with great cast. Hitchcock's storytelling leads the whole industry for 40 years!

1.0,vertigo,One of Hitchcock's best. A movie with a whole lot of twists and turns. James Stewart and Kim Novak give outstanding performances.
1.0,vertigo,"Hitchcock's best, most disturbing, and most moving film plays far better on repeat viewings, allowing one to ignore the private eye and thriller trappings and focus on the romantic, obsessive, emotional core."
1.0,vertigo,This movie is like an onion. It has layers.
1.0,vertigo,Molding an image to the tune of our dreams...Obsession has never been portrayed so good...
1.0,vertigo,"The weirdest, trippiest, most thought-provoking love story ever put on film...and now our HD TVs."

1.0,vertigo,This movie has a lot of things to talk about
1.0,vertigo,"As time goes by the better ""Vertigo"" looks!"
1.0,vertigo,"What makes Vertigo so great is the mood it sets. The haunting score roaring while you watch a man fall in love, lose love, crumble, then obsess. The beauty of it is quite unmatched."
1.0,vertigo,"amazing! the art of it, the story, and the way it was restored, too"
1.0,vertigo,Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece.

1.0,vertigo,"Vertigo is, in a word, unbelievable. Never has a story of obsession sat with me quite like this one. It's a slow, tense burn of a thriller, as well as a genuinely honest and personal drama. I love every frame of this film."
1.0,vertigo,amazing!!! every single shot is amazing!!!
1.0,vertigo,"On hieno mestarin duuni, mutta maailman paras elokuva? Ei nyt sent√§√§n."

1.0,vertigo,"This is the one. My favorite movie of all time. Was not quite a warm welcome to cinema back in 1958, but in time it would become Hitchcock's masterpiece. Everything from Hitch's direction to a great cast, Bernard Herrmann's score, and San Francisco's setting, Vertigo is that good."
1.0,vertigo,"hands down, vertigo is my all-time favorite film."
1.0,vertigo,"Is it the best movie ever made? Debatable. It's certainly the most artful. Hitchcock's finest achievement is about the destructive power of love, the loneliness of consciousness, the tragedy of cinema, all brought into focus through sumptuous ambiguity and beguiling technical virtuosity."
1.0,vertigo,"Unpredictable, Thrilling, Well Acted, Beautifully Shot, Impeccably crafted, My favorite movie ever created"

1.0,vertigo,"Vertigo is bound to have you shuddering in their seat from the minute it drags you in, with a brilliant story and cinematography with typically clever motifs from Hitchcock. Even though the set reminds us of so many other Hitchcock films, it plays out like no other piece in existence."
1.0,vertigo,Did not see that coming at all. Fantastic work from the master himself. I cannot wait to explore more of his works.
1.0,vertigo,"A haunting masterpiece. A slow-burner, and not quite the usual Hitchcock suspense story; Vertigo deals with one man's obsession and personal frailty in the face of mysterious outside forces."

1.0,vertigo,"The cover sums it up when it says masterpiece. The look on James Stewart's face as he's looking down followed by the awesome ""vertigo effect"" is enough to give me acrophobia."
1.0,vertigo,"Mind-bending! Alfred Hitchcock is the godfather of ""psychological thrillers""... and Vertigo proves as to why he should be canonized as a saint in the religion of filmmaking."

1.0,vertigo,One word: Perfection.
1.0,vertigo,One of Hitchcock's best. Pyscho's still his masterpiece in my eyes tho
1.0,vertigo,"A beautifully shot, well-acted piece that conjoins the second and third act in such a way that is hard to distinguish where the climax of the film is, unless the second and third act deliberately sit as the climax."
1.0,vertigo,This film definately requires two viewings to realise just how beautiful and yet freightening it is. the movie itself is meant to obssess us and oh how fun and scary it is to be obsessed with vertigo

0.0,vertigo,"Oh god, is this movie ever overrated."
1.0,vertigo,I'm speechless. Speechless. I have no speech.
1.0,vertigo,"How does Hitchcock so seamlessly blend an engrossing, sly mystery/thriller with a portrait of a man's degeneratively obsessive tendencies? We can only marvel at the master's direction."
1.0,vertigo,There aren't enough stars

1.0,vertigo,A Hitchcock masterpiece and one of James Stewart's very best and interesting performances. Never fails to fascinate. An examination of obsession and identity. Frequently tops my all-time favourite films list.
1.0,vertigo,I absolutely love this one. Jimmy Stewart was definitely cheated out of an Oscar for this role. Hitchcock is amazing (as usual). :)
1.0,vertigo,Jimmy Stewart is the man.
1.0,vertigo,Another Hitchcock masterpiece.
1.0,vertigo,"The mid to late 1950s were Hitchcock's best years, and Vertigo is no exception. Kim Novak and Jimmy Stewart are excellent and San Francisco has never looked better."
1.0,vertigo,"Same review as Rear Window, only more so."
1.0,vertigo,A Hitchcock masterpiece.
1.0,vertigo,"Another Hitchcock classic. Stewart gives off one of his best roles as a man who, aptly, suffers from vertigo. However, it is also the audience who suffers from dizziness and confusion due to the legendary director's clever plot and visual mastery. A superb picture. Highly recommended!"
1.0,vertigo,Probably Hitchcock's best film. Debatable. Its one hell of a thriller.
1.0,vertigo,"The only Hitchcock film I've seen that I really loke, or in this case love!"

1.0,vertigo,Hitchcock's finest most beautiful moment. A genuine masterpiece and an all-time classic.
1.0,vertigo,"If the Mona Lisa is proof that colors are capable of creating blinding beauty, Vertigo is proof that the eye of a lens is just as able, the prose of human speech just as delicious as an authentic Chinese Cuisine and a man behind a machine is as dangerous as a man with a pen or brush."
1.0,vertigo,Chilling to the bone. Absolutely one of Hitchcock's best (and one of Jimmy Stewart's). Completely mesmerizing O___O

1.0,vertigo,Hitchcock's unmistakeable masterpiece.
1.0,vertigo,"Fantastic cinema, perhaps Hitchcocks greatest film. I found it very haunting, and it's interesting here how Hitchcock uses Kim Novak, as one feels sympathetic for her, as she is trapped. Very sad, I think. The ending reminds me a little of Chinatown."

1.0,vertigo,I just joined Flixter and this is the first movie I searched. Guess which is my favorite movie?

1.0,vertigo,Hitchcock's finest film and one of the most twisted and haunting love stories ever told. There hasn't been anything like it.
1.0,vertigo,"If, by the end of this movie, you look on the ground and there isn't a puddle of piss and drool, there's something wrong with you.

1.0,vertigo,Hitchcock's Magnum Opus
1.0,rashomon,A directorial masterpiece about perception which has gone on to be named in academia for the interpretations of events.
0.0,rashomon,"Tiny pearl, overpowering melodrama."
1.0,rashomon,Akira Kurosawa brilliantly portrays how an incident can be told as many different stories from different point of views and none of them coincides with the real truth which is yet unknown even after the movie finishes.
1.0,rashomon,Brilliantly crafted film with a groundbreaking narrative structure and eye opening direction by Akira Kurosawa. Simple yet brilliant set design and beautiful camera technique that changed the medium forever.
1.0,rashomon,"Not just technically brilliant, but an intriguing mystery where the truth doesn't matter as much as the characters within it."
1.0,rashomon,"An influence to cinema lovers, Rashomon changed the foreign film business"
1.0,rashomon,Kurosawa sure knows how to tell a story.
0.0,rashomon,I was unfortunately bored out of my mind.
1.0,rashomon,"Rating a classic like this is obviously foolish. Rashomon reminds us that truth is more than facts in the outer world, but what is going on in our own inner worlds."
1.0,rashomon,"Kurosawa's best. A surprising commentary that still seems to reflect even the most modern of times. He provides the story with challenging perspectives, true levels of character flaws, and blind judgment. What we get is a film most human."
1.0,rashomon,"Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece has become a copied plot-line since its release.

1.0,rashomon,Was captured by the story and the twisted truth.

1.0,rashomon,Rashomon was a very interesting movie and surpirsed me that they were able to make come from five different points of views. This was also other master piece by Akira Kurosawa.
1.0,rashomon,One of my favorite Kurosawa movies and an exercise on truth. Beautiful photography.
1.0,rashomon,"Friggin Masterpiece. A murder drama done well to exploit the highs and lows of humanity. painfully misogynistic, but so were those times."
1.0,rashomon,"I can sit here and talk about a film's writing, or character development, or editing and cinematography and just go on a giant spiel, when I could really just say four words. I loved this movie!"
1.0,rashomon,Would have to say that this is my favorite of Kurosawa's.
1.0,rashomon,Another excellent example of Kurosawa's art -- A master of the Cinema working in top form.
1.0,rashomon,"I don't need to write a review of this. I've been so taken with this film I've watched it 5 times over the course of the week. I've been dumbfounded to find that students in one of my film classes found it boring, slow, and melodramatic."
1.0,rashomon,"i thought this movie was really planned out and a great success. i don't think there was one specific genre. because i did laugh, but there were dramatic parts as well. great movie."
1.0,rashomon,"See the 2008 restored version, as it just looks and sounds incredible. If you have never seen Rashomon, then there's so much to learn about film narative, film technique, and film history. Kurosawa's first (of many) true masterpieces, and every time you watch it, you will see it differently."
1.0,rashomon,Everyone's got a reason to lie........this gets better every time I see it.
1.0,rashomon,"Ho. Ly. Fuck. This movie is truly incredible. The way in which Kurosawa approaches the topic of reality as being entirely subjective is incredible. While people have copied many of the ideas in this film, if you look at it in terms of the time it was truly revolutionary. What a movie."
1.0,rashomon,The key to a Japanese woman heart if you don't want to know what is Bunraku.
1.0,rashomon,Rewatching this for the first time in many years. Timeless. Fucking. Classic.

1.0,rashomon,"What's so good about this movie? It hasn't aged, it's simple yet striking. (struck me completely), we all know we are subjective, but to what level does subjectivity affect our views? Found this movie so profound. Simply brilliant."
1.0,rashomon,"An intriguing story, fantastic acting, and expert directing combine to form another classic from Kurosawa, delivering an indepth look at the idea of truth and the purpose of life and its trials."
1.0,rashomon,"I think this is actually better than seven samurai (there, I said it). more style, more seriousness, more heart, and more thought, I cannot understand why this isn't regarded as Kurosawa's greatest achievement."
1.0,rashomon,"This was my first Kurosawa movie ever. I saw it way back in middle school, and it started my love affair with his films. Almost a ""who dun it?"" that talks about the human condition, if you haven't seen this film go watch it. If you have, go watch it again. your view of it might change."
1.0,rashomon,Kurosawa Japan best. Big-time movie! Yes?
1.0,rashomon,A powerful look at subjectivity.
1.0,rashomon,"Sure, it's not packed with tons of action, but it's very emotional, very suspenseful, and very simple in its presentation which adds an extra element of elegance and sophistication; all with an ending that makes you reflect on your own selfishness. The symbolism and metaphors were tops."
1.0,rashomon,A true masterpiece in all aspects..with unheard of use of camera nddynamic lighting..akira kurosawa's classic is a feast even today..the presentation of story..suspense merged with courtroom drama..inspired countless movies nd has left a legacy.. a must watch for all movie lovers...
1.0,rashomon,One of my favorites.
1.0,rashomon,"Excelent, one of the best movies by Kurosava , I saw it for first time when I was 8 since that time i saw I couple of times and still amazes me..."
1.0,rashomon,"Blew me away. Akira Kurosawa towers above most other directors in the 20th century and this is no exception. Rashomon is leagues above all other films in the 50's, equaled only by Kurosawa's other classics."
1.0,rashomon,"Not just a masterpiece, it's practically part of the periodic table of cinema."
1.0,rashomon,"My Rating: 95% .  Beautiful, Haunting, Surreal and Bittersweet. Rashomon is a film that is spot on and very true."
1.0,rashomon,"If you've never seen a film by Akira Kurosawa, this is a good start. He also made Throne of Blood, a samurai Macbeth and Ran, based on Shakespeare's King Lear."
1.0,rashomon,Akira's best work! So many filmmakers have tried to capture the essence of this film. Nothing beats the original.
1.0,rashomon,"Fascinating, influential drama which despite its age still has the power to provoke and astonish."
1.0,rashomon,"An exquisitely rendered representation of perception, human brokenness, and the hopeless bravely hoping despite these odds."
1.0,rashomon,"Kurosawa's best...Employs a multi-flashback recounting the same incident, as a plot device.. 60 years on and filmmakers all over the world still get inspired by this classic!!!"
1.0,rashomon,"A timeless masterpiece in world cinema.....and I feel Toshiro Mifune, as Tajomaru the bandit, does a better ""Raavan"" act than Abhishek Bachchan as Beera...."
1.0,rashomon,A brilliant movie that has been poorly copied many times since its release.
1.0,rashomon,"This movie leads a new form of narrative and photography. Great scenario: the gate of the city, the rain... Marvelous!"
1.0,rashomon,"Myst√É¬©rieux, d'une modernit√É¬© sans √É¬©gale et incroyablement prenant. Toshiro Mifune est d√É¬©ment."
1.0,rashomon,"""I don't mind a lie, so long as it's interesting,"" says the cynic. Another way to look at it is that everything is true, that the stories don't fit because of what others overlooked in their pride."
0.0,rashomon,"The music in the movie was horrible. The whole thing is black and white, which is terrible. Some of the acting was terribly overacted. The fight scenes were fakey.On top of that, it's a horribly disgusting story.Yep, terrible and horrible describe it best."
1.0,rashomon,"An impressive foreign film that leaves you guessing to the very end. Visually stunning, and so poetic even Shakespeare would have been proud. One of my new favorite films, if you know what a good movie can be without CGI or a big budget, definitely see this film."
1.0,rashomon,"In league with Ikiru, its full of sorrow and mystery."
1.0,rashomon,"It is a testament to Akira Kurosawa that he can get away with risking everything making such an original movie as this. You must remember, in 1950, Rashomon was unheard of."
1.0,rashomon,a Kurosawa Akira film
1.0,rashomon,"Even though it's now coming on sixty years old, Rashomon hasnt aged a day. With its new state of the art digital restoration its never been a better time to catch this masterpiece."

1.0,rashomon,One of the best films ever made.
1.0,rashomon,"My all time favorite movie. A fantastic study of human nature, egotism, and our propensity to lie. Add in Kurosawa's amazing cinematography and you have one of the greatest films of all time."

1.0,rashomon,"Genial pel√É¬≠cula, rupturista y con una gran profundidad, sobre todo en cuanto a la naturaleza humana y la subjetividad. Un maestro Kurosawa."
1.0,rashomon,One of Kurosawa's best and one of the most influential films of all time. Toshiro Mifune gives another great performance as do the rest of the cast.
1.0,rashomon,Cinema at its best & the proof of Kurosawa's cinematic genius... An awesome plot & brilliant direction. Watch it just for the sheer pleasure that spectacular cinema can bring to u...Toshiro Mifune rocks!!!
1.0,rashomon,I agree that this is one of the top foreign films of the 20th century.
1.0,rashomon,"Story telling at its absolut best. 4 different versions of the truth. A rape, and a murder in the woods. Each version is an interesting look. It may not be Kurosawa's best but its a great film and had arguably the biggest impact in america of all japanese cinema."
1.0,rashomon,"The film is much less formally daring than its literary source, but its virtues are still plentiful: Kurosawa's visual style at its most muscular, rhythmically nuanced editing, and excellent performances"
1.0,rashomon,"Ver estas pel√É¬≠culas es como leer un poema, es puro arte. Ya quiero ver los Siete Samurais."
1.0,rashomon,Excellent film that really makes you think!
1.0,rashomon,uncut original version only...criterion for example!
1.0,rashomon,It is Akira Kurosawa do I really need to explain why this is an amazing film?
1.0,rashomon,Even those who aren't into Japanese film will enjoy this elegant masterpiece by Kurosawa. A crime is recounted from several conflicting points of view. Which is the truth? All and none. Reality lies between the stories.
1.0,rashomon,"Kurosawa's best. Can you ever trust anyone's memory, or yours?"
1.0,rashomon,My personal favorite of Kurosawa's works.
1.0,rashomon,"A classic. A story told from 4 different viewpoints. Great cinematography, performances, and dialogue."
1.0,rashomon,if u ask for most influential movie of previous century then rashamon will certainly get a thought.
1.0,rashomon,"Zapravo je odlican film. Odlican je i predlozak po kojem je napisan scenarij. Mislio sam mu dat manje jer ipak gluma nije tako uvjerljiva na zapadnjacki nacin, ali ipak sam na vrijeme odustao od te ideje. Film, naravno, izgleda prekrasno."
1.0,rashomon,"A really simple film with the same story told from different perspectives. I have seen this done in numerous films since, but none have been able to do it this well. The story was gripping, and working out the truth was impossible. Brilliant."
1.0,rashomon,Amazing.That's all. Amazing. See it.
1.0,rashomon,Storytelling doesn't get any better than this. Kurosawa's 'Rashomon' is a master in making the viewer question the truth. The character recaps are told through much creativeness.
1.0,rashomon,"So far, out of the handful of Kurosawa films I've seen, I might say that Rashomon is his most aesthetically pleasing film."
1.0,rashomon,"The villain. The bride. The deceased. The woodcutter. All with a story to tell, the ending no different in each case: a man dies, with the circumstances being lost to bias. \"
1.0,rashomon,Rashomon (1950) is still considered to be a puzzle/ a gimmick ... Explorers deeply the human psyche and IT SHOULD NOT BE MISSED !!
1.0,rashomon,"Thoughtful mediation on perception versus reality using a (then revolutionary) structure that's been tried many times since but ever bested. It's a masterfully made, nearly perfect film, with great sequences and terrific acting (even if Mifune's performance is too big)."
1.0,rashomon,"Good adaptation of 2 of Akutagawa Ryunosuke's short stories, Rashomon and In a Bamboo Grove. A must-read book and must-see movie. Maybe Toshiro Mifune's most aclaimed performance, along with Shichinin no Samurai."
1.0,rashomon,A masterpiece. The 2008 restored version is a must see!
1.0,rashomon,"A very deep film about morality, truth, the ugly side of human nature and eventually hope. Though some may think that Toshiro Mifune overacted his performance I thought it work well for the movie."
1.0,rashomon,Brilliant considering its time
1.0,rashomon,"One of the best Movies ever made, an amazing amusing Movie with great Actors about a Story who was telled by different Persons and they are according different again amazing from how much Views a Picture can be watched"

1.0,rashomon,The film that introduced Kurosawa to the west after the war. Mifune & Shimura are fantastic.
1.0,rashomon,A masterwork of nonlinear narrative.
1.0,rashomon,"Two guys sitting in the rain. There was 3 different version of a story of the same event. It was more about the selfishness and oppurtunistic nature of man. The monk almost loose hope towards humanity, yet a little shade of kindness in the end gave him back the hope he almost lost."
1.0,rashomon,"An insanely clever classic that keeps you guessing throughout the film. The story is told brilliantly from many different angles, ending with a logical conclusion."
1.0,rashomon,i wish I could give it more stars
1.0,rashomon,Perhaps the most ripped off story of the last 50 years. OF course that describes much of Kurasowa's canon. One of the greatest films from one of cinema's greatest directors.
0.0,rashomon,"Well, I was bored to tears. Apparently it's by some director who is supposed to be a genius and everyone is ripping off him, but if that were true - I wouldn't have enjoyed a movie ever. It's old, but that's no excuse for boring me to tears."

1.0,rashomon,"A must-see. A storyline like nothing the west has ever done before, yet very westernized in the approach. A surprisingly taboo subject for the 1950's, a creepy ""medium,"" and a shocking ending that threw me for a loop. I couldn't understand how someone could possibly not enjoy this movie."
1.0,rashomon,Parang senate inquiry sa sex scandal!
1.0,rashomon,This doesn't quite top Throne of Blood as my favorite Kurosawa movie but it gets close. Really really close.

0.0,rashomon,I missed the plot and pretty much all the other things in this film because I was too busy trying to stay awake..
1.0,rashomon,"A masterpeice of cinema, by Kurisawa. Toshiro Mufuni highlights this macabre tale of a crime as seen from several diferent points of view. Later inspired numerous films including Hero, and Vantage Point."
1.0,rashomon,"Dates amazingly well, the only 'distance' comes from culture and a theatrical style. As beautifully filmed, absorbing and thought provoking as its reputation."

1.0,rashomon,This is a perfect movie.
1.0,rashomon,Classic murder mystery.
1.0,rashomon,"Ispirato a due racconti di Akunagawa, il film ha aperto una vera e propria stagione di scoperta del cinema orientale in Italia. Ancora oggi la visione √É¬® godibile e rappresenta una sfida all'intelligenza e sensibilit√É¬† di ogni spettatore! Le riprese della foresta sono indimenticabili."
1.0,rashomon,"I feel like this movie will influence me as a filmmaker a great deal. It really is a film for filmmakers, and covers some deep philosophical ground. I still think Ikiru is his best film, but this movie is still great."
1.0,rashomon,"Excellent movie... if you love movies, you have to see this. Great story, great directing, great everything. 'Truth' is a relative term when several different accounts of the same crime are not only different, but also logically incompatible."
1.0,rashomon,One of Kurosawa's early classic's where so many Directors have copied from. It will not be everyone's cup of tea it is what it is and it is one of Kurosawa's best.
1.0,rashomon,the best story all the time
1.0,rashomon,"There's a reason why Kurosawa got an Oscar for this film. A true journey into human nature and desires, it ends up that the lies told are worse than the actual crime. Absolutely brilliant."

1.0,rashomon,the origianl non-linear samurai film noir

1.0,rashomon,"It's a brilliantly complicated piece of work that offers no clear answers, forcing the viewers to make up their own mind as to what it was that happened based on the self-serving testimony of the 4 people involved in the horrific incident in the woods."
1.0,rashomon,"After watching this movie, I still find myself asking what happened in those woods. If you learn anything, it's the complexity of the truth, memory, and human motive."
1.0,rashomon,"Brilliant directing by Akira Kurosawa! Wonderful story that brings up points of human nature, lies, and especially the powerful affect women have on men. Beautiful, and extremely symbolic. A must-see for hard-core movie lovers."

0.0,la_la_land,"This was a terrible movie, just proof that the academy awards are all about hollywood insiders stroking each other and not about rewarding the best movies. Self indulgent, agonizing tripe. Watching Emma Stone attempt to dance and sing is nothing short of painful."
1.0,la_la_land,"Definetly one of the best movies I've ever seen. I went in to the movie completely blank, and got out totally devastated. It has beautiful music, a great story and a fantastic look.

1.0,last_picture_show,"It was like ""The Graduate"" set in Texas yet different and in some ways better. Each character was developed to the utmost so that one could understand character interactions and not deem them stereotypical. Beautifully done there are few unique movie like this, new and old."
1.0,last_picture_show,"Cloris Leachman and Ben Johnson won the Oscars for their incredible performances, but every single actor in The Last Picture Show is a standout. Peter Bogdanovich's film is a reminder of why I loves 1970s cinema. And, as the tagline honestly says, not much has changed."

1.0,last_picture_show,Ben Johnson as Sam The Lion gives the best performance on film ever. Love this film.
1.0,last_picture_show,"Ignore the upbeat music in the trailer shown here and replace it with classic Hank Williams as used throughout the movie. Some of the best acting on film from Cloris Leachman, Ellen Burstyn and Ben Johnson. Brilliant adaptation of the McMurtry novel."
1.0,last_picture_show,This could easily be titled No Country for Young Men and sum up the story perfectly. The characters have literally no hope for a happy life in this town and it is simply fascinating to watch that reality crumble in to place for them. Beyond that the cast is phenomenal.
1.0,last_picture_show,"This just might be the most well-crafted teen angst film ever made. Perfectly cast.*NOTE: Deserving of it's ""R"" rating, not for the youngsters."

1.0,last_picture_show,"Like they said when it was made in 1971, ""The Best Movie of 1953"". Great performances throughout."
1.0,last_picture_show,"The Last Picture Show is basically a Norman Rockwell painting of a Shakespearean tragedy with the word ""smoldering"" placed somewhere in there. If you can't relate to this movie in some way, if some part of it doesn't reflect some aspect of your life, you are probably not human."
1.0,last_picture_show,"An exciting piece of 70's cinema. Despite taking place in the 1950's this film feels timeless. The relationships are raw, sexy, frustrating, and human. Mistakes are made, lovers become entangled with other lovers. What a beautiful web that Bogdanovich weaves."

1.0,last_picture_show,This is one of my favorite movies ever. Brooding and beautifully shot.

1.0,last_picture_show,probally one of the greatest coming of age movies ever
1.0,last_picture_show,"An excellent coming-of-age film that captures the small-town postwar vibe of Amarene, Texas (actually, Archer City). Bogdanovich directs a dream-team cast."

1.0,last_picture_show,"I had no idea what to expect when I rented this movie on a friend's recommendation. It is stunning and just when you feel lulled by the languid beauty, it shocks you with sex. I recommend watching it in bed when it's raining with a good friend and a bottle of something."

1.0,last_picture_show,Masterpiece in every sense of the word!
1.0,last_picture_show,Filmed like a 50's movie with all the unsavory details added in. It's too bad that the director couldn't sustain this level of quality through the 70's.
1.0,last_picture_show,"Probably in my all-time top five movies. I always discover something new when I watch this. Great performances, especially from Ben Johnson and Ellen Burstyn."

1.0,last_picture_show,One of the best American films of the 70's.
1.0,last_picture_show,"Great acting (especially by Bridges). Black and white at first seems a little strange, but fits the movie perfectly, reflecting the desolate, almost ghost town they live in. The ending takes a while to understand the meaning of, but it still ranks as one of the best movies I've ever seen."
1.0,last_picture_show,I love how they gave it the 1950s feel.
1.0,last_picture_show,A extremely potent film about the ending of adolesence and the difficulties that go along with it. This film touched me like no other film has touched me. I love this film. Could there have been a more wonderful last picture show than Red River? Bogdanovich is brilliant.
1.0,last_picture_show,This movie has some of the best ensemble acting I've ever seen! All the characters are three-dimensional and very true to life.
1.0,last_picture_show,"This movie is SO true to life in Texas. It's depressing, especially when you realise that these characters and town are based off of real life!"
1.0,last_picture_show,A classic. And Timothy Bottoms is hot.

1.0,last_picture_show,This is one of the greatest movies in the world

1.0,last_picture_show,"Heartbreaking and tragic; Bogdanovich crafts a phenomenal film of substance, character and thematic sadness."
1.0,last_picture_show,One of the great films of all time--a bleak and sad loss-of-innocence story with rich characters and great acting. Wonderfully dreary b&w; photography. Why did director Bogdanovich's career collapse??
1.0,last_picture_show,Absolutely amazing and memorable. Bottoms nails what I believe is a very hard role. The film makes you justify grey subject matter in black-and-white. It's an homage to other movies which never could have shown what this movie does.
1.0,last_picture_show,"Set in the 50s, but a timeless story of the loss of childhood naivete."

1.0,last_picture_show,"in my top 2 or 3, there is nothing wrong with this movie. it actually looks like it was made in the era it is set in. I dont know how bogdanovich did it, especially considering most of his other work. (actually it was because of his then wife Polly Platt who should have been a director)"
1.0,last_picture_show,This is the last word on dying American towns. It is also beautifully filmed.
1.0,last_picture_show,Absolutely fantastic. One of my favorite movies ever. You can literaly feel this town dying.

1.0,last_picture_show,The best character movie I've seen. Reminds me a lot of American Beauty.
1.0,last_picture_show,A stark black-and-white drama about a fading small texas town in the 1950s....Perhaps director Peter Bogdanovich's finest hour second only to the more sugar coated Paper Moon. The most mournful of all youth films.
1.0,last_picture_show,"This move is a school in honest filmmaking. It's slow pace help construct a world so real, so engaging that I couldn't stop watching."
1.0,last_picture_show,a cinematic masterpiece coming of age story adapted from the book by larry mcmurtry

1.0,last_picture_show,The book is even better.

1.0,last_picture_show,this is such a good movie. its raelly depressing. its about kids who feel hhopeless. the football team cant do anything. there is a lot of symbolism. the main boy gets made fun of a lot. no ones going anywhere. the movie theater is a symbol too.
1.0,last_picture_show,this movie was way ahead of its time and still holds up to this day .
1.0,last_picture_show,Stunning performances from such young actors. McMurtry's novel loses none of it's beauty on screen.

1.0,mr_turner,great insight to the British painter
0.0,mr_turner,I could not even make it 15 minutes into this before turning it off. I could not handle the horrible and almost incoherent accents of everyone. This might be a great movie...but I will never know because I just don't care.
1.0,mr_turner,Felt i'd stepped back in time. A beautifully made film about a fascinating man.
0.0,mr_turner,Interminably long. Frustratingly lacking in plot. 2.5 hours I won't get back.
0.0,mr_turner,Yawn. This was just excruciating monotony...Gelatiny even! I lasted 5 minutes and then left the room. I couldn't take any more of Mr. Turner's grunting gloominess. The half star is for the beautiful landscape.
0.0,mr_turner,"An excruciating slog that seems made only to mock those who see art in something made by a monkey throwing feces at a blank canvas, since J. M. W. Turner is portrayed as a repulsive, vulgar and contemptible hog and played by Spall as a ridiculous growling caricature."
1.0,mr_turner,Wonderful portrayal of the life and artistic evolution of the eccentric British painter J. M. W. Turner.
0.0,mr_turner,Like drinking a glass of plain water.
1.0,mr_turner,Positively stunning portrayed of this artistic genius in all of his flaws. Timothy Spall is a force of nature. Best seen with subtitles.
1.0,mr_turner,"Mike Leigh's masterpiece: gloriously lit and photographed, self-effacingly directed, wonderfully well-acted by a huge cast, with a transcendent central performance by Timothy Spall. A word too for Gary Yershon's plangent string score. Hugely recommended."
1.0,mr_turner,"Classic Mike Leigh and breathtakingly beautiful. A fascinating recreation of English life at the time. Sometimes brutal, sometimes funny, always captivating."
1.0,mr_turner,Mike Leigh is a god. Timothy Spall was fantastic.

0.0,mr_turner,"Wow, I guess I watched a different movie than the critics. This was useless."
1.0,mr_turner,"This is how you make a biographical film. Most people will have trouble hearing the dialogue (unless British), which I think explains the disparity between critics and the audience ratings."

1.0,mr_turner,"If a Romantic painting could play out in the fourth dimension, the result would not be unlike this film. Everything your typical studio-manufactured biopic does wrong or predictably Mr. Turner does inventively or not at all."
1.0,mr_turner,"Delectable and finely crafted piece by Mike Leigh, impressive performance from Timothy Spall."
1.0,mr_turner,GAWD DAMN THIS WAS TERRIFIC
1.0,mr_turner,While munching smacks I was made aware that I was watching another Mike Leigh masterpiece and should LISTEN UP!

1.0,mr_turner,"Quite a historical figure, impressive show of contemporary culture and art academy."
0.0,mr_turner,"This movie blows! I can't believe the critics on this. Seriously, I walked out after 100 minutes. I couldn't take it anymore."
0.0,mr_turner,It is very slow and hard to follow. It starts during Mr. Turner's 50s and young audiences have no emotional connection with the protagonist.
0.0,mr_turner,The only reason some critic would see five stars around this snore-fest was the he or she was knocked out with a club.
0.0,mr_turner,The worst movie i've ever seen.
0.0,mr_turner,"Plodding and painful, this film leaves you wondering why Turner painted and why we should care."
1.0,mr_turner,Outstanding acting.....
0.0,mr_turner,"A bleak, plodding, overlong, soul-sucking waste of 2-1/2 hours, with no likable characters."
0.0,mr_turner,Too long - not enough interesting dialogue or plot to keep my interest. Found his sexual desires scenes to be either gross or boring. Director/Producer could have done a much better job at crafting this story.
1.0,mr_turner,"Timothy Spall could be considered the J. M. W. Turner of modern acting as his embodiment is so raw and unprecedented. Not counting the long-winded conversations, Mr. Turner is unconventionally engrossing and a real success."
0.0,mr_turner,"Interesting, but long and boring.."

0.0,mr_turner,Worst movie that I have seen in years. The main character is disgusting and not much of anything happens with the plot.

0.0,mr_turner,"Easily, the second most boring movie I've ever had the misfortune of seeing."
0.0,mr_turner,Absolutely the most boring film I've seen in years. I can never remember falling asleep in an theater before but I could not keep my eyes open through this one. If I wasn't sitting in the middle of a crowed row I would have walked out after the first 30min.
1.0,mr_turner,"A real ""art house"" film!!! Beautiful cinematography and an outstanding performance by Timothy Spall makes this a must see for anyone who appreciates film as art."
0.0,mr_turner,"Two and a half hours of watching a very ugly, unpleasant person do boring things. Shockingly, brutally slow, insufferably full of itself, and overall one of the worst films of the year."
0.0,mr_turner,Ugh. Boring. Great costumes though.
0.0,mr_turner,An offensive abomination glorifying disgusting people and values with every shot forced to look like an artistic Instagram picture.
0.0,mr_turner,"Acting, Period decor and architecture excellent. But the movie was weird and boring and painfully long at 2 1/2 hrs."
0.0,mr_turner,Two and one-half hours of my life I will not get back. It is LITERALLY like watching paint dry.
0.0,mr_turner,"This is the slowest, dullest movie I have seen in recent memory. If you think you'd enjoy watching a miserable, mumbling old fart putting on and taking off his coat and hat for over 2 1/2 hours, then this is the movie for you."

0.0,mr_turner,An incredibly boring film.
0.0,mr_turner,"Avoid this movie at all costs if you like Turner's paintings and want to save 2.5 hours of your life. While cinematography was great and Spall's acting a tour de force, nothing other than the slow and revolting happens in the movie."
0.0,mr_turner,"I couldn't understand most of what was said, at least for the first hour until I left. It really needed closed captioning because they were speaking a foreign language as far as I was concerned. Also, nothing happened."
0.0,mr_turner,"Very disappointing. Read the reviews and thought it would be excellent, but it was over long and full of caricatures. If it had ended after the death of Mr Turner senior, it would have been more satisfactory."

0.0,mr_turner,Excruciatingly slow and boring . Couldn't watch this to completion
0.0,mr_turner,Clearly an attempt to cash in on the Downton train! A remarkably long film about a quite unremarkable life. Maybe Hayden's life would have made for a more interesting story but I guess not enough Americans will have heard of him! Thoroughly disappointed and ripped off!
0.0,mr_turner,Grotesque and goes nowhere.
1.0,mr_turner,Great film.Wonderful photography

0.0,mr_turner,Long and Boring. A waste of time.
1.0,mr_turner,"Stunning visuals, great acting from the whole cast. Interesting take in that it shows Turner as he slipped from fashion as the Victorian period came of age. He came from the era of the Prince Regent and his manners reflected this. Some may think it slow paced but this is a Mike Lee film!"
0.0,mr_turner,"Timothy Spall doesn't carry it off. The film is too slow, & far too long. Best actors are the housekeeper (??) & the mistress (Marion Bailey)."
0.0,mr_turner,"When reading the critic's reviews, I can't help but feel here is an ""emperor's new clothes"" quality to this film. The audience is right. This is a mediocre film that is interesting solely for it's period sets and costume"
0.0,mr_turner,"Not Smalls at his best, an interesting film, not a feel good film, left cinema feeling depressed, like most I would suspect, nothing to lift the film out from the gloomy ending, more humour would have helped."
1.0,mr_turner,A funny (and yet sad) portrayal of one of Britain's best artists!
0.0,mr_turner,Goodness me. How to dash every hope of a convincing narrative or story. Spall's grunting cannot save this piece from being anything other than a Frankenstien stich together of vignettes. So much potential lost by a film maker's pursuit of a blockbuster.
0.0,mr_turner,Boring and tedious - wasted almost an hour of my life and then left the cinema. Noticed a few other people snoozing on my way out. I usually like Mike Leigh films but not this one.

1.0,mr_turner,enjoyable biopic well acted and directed
0.0,mr_turner,This film is VERY poor. We left early after giving it 45 minutes it had NO storyline. We really wanted it to be good. We read the reviews and we really can't believe that critics gave it 95% and the audience gave it 75%.
0.0,mr_turner,"The most boring movie I ever seen. 2 hours was waiting if something going to happen. The last 20 minutes just waiting when Mr. Turner finally dies. Despite beautiful pictures, I recommend go to a museum and don't waste your time."
0.0,mr_turner,"Way too long and uninteresting for the general audience. Might be of interest to people very familiar with his paintings. I would suggest you should at least be familiar with Turners paintings before seeing the film, as the film seems to refer to them a lot."

1.0,mr_turner,"Thoroughly well made film. Photography, story, acting and settings. Well worth a view."
1.0,mr_turner,Mike Leigh at his very very best. This is scrumptious to look at and well acted. Spall is very good as are the rest of the cast. Its a film about Turner himself more that the actual art. But some scenes look like a picture. Serene. Funny in parts and well worth a watch
1.0,mr_turner,"Timothy Spall's magnificent performance is the centrepiece of Mike Leigh's film, which is as finely detailed and richly textured as a great oil painting."
1.0,taxi_driver,"Probably one of my favorite films. This movie touches on themes of isolation in a city of millions, PTSD (where do you think Travis Bickle got that army jacket with his name on it from? What war?), and the effects of crime in the big city. A classic."

1.0,taxi_driver,"Martin Scorsese's best film? Certainly his most influential, cause Quentin Tarantino and John Woo have both taking more than a few cues from this baby. The fact that it's still so unsettling in this day of no-holds-barred-blood-letting films says a lot, too."

1.0,taxi_driver,"One of my all-timers. Probably my favorite performance by an actor. Not a role heavy on dialogue nor expressive emoting, but Bobby Deniro at his finest. Robbed by a dead man at the Oscars, but who cares?!"

1.0,taxi_driver,"I finally saw this from start to finish after all these years. This is pure filmmaking, I loved almost every minute of it. Incredible performances all around even Scorsese.

1.0,taxi_driver,This film really shows you how disgusting the world is. It also shows you that you can make a difference no matter how disgusting the world is.
1.0,taxi_driver,"My second favorite film of all time. A movie really for the lonely. Robert de Niro did a great job here. I feel like I was the main character.

1.0,taxi_driver,"Amazing. A portrait of urban loneliness and paranoia that resonates, even after New York has largely moved beyond the crime-ridden, grimy, licentious cesspool it depicts. It forces you to confront why we we so often sympathize with vigilantes. Calling it a masterpiece is not an exaggeration."
1.0,taxi_driver,"You cannot go wrong with Taxi Driver. This is Deniro at his best. Absolutely a perfect film. It was horrifying, romantic, and mysterious. Has an incredible score and in my opinion, the greatest screenplay of all time."

1.0,taxi_driver,Not only De Niro's greatest film but arguably Scorsese's as well. Transgressive (perhaps nihilistic) fiction hasn't been this good since Dostoevsky's Notes From The Underground. The film is a real classic and you can't claim to be a movie buff unless you've seen it.
1.0,taxi_driver,"One of the greatest films ever made. Robert De Niro gives a unforgettable performance, playing the forever alone & misunderstood Travis. No other movie puts you in the mind of a character like Taxi Driver."

1.0,taxi_driver,Robert De Niro exhibiting his best performance of his time. A cult classic.
1.0,taxi_driver,"Taxi Driver is that rare beast: a dark, masculine melodrama that doubles as a nuanced and immaculately planned art film. The film is both a deeply personal exploration of chaos and an exposure of a twisted reality. It is Scorsese's greatest work; his most probing and insightful."
1.0,taxi_driver,Scorsese+deniro =Greatness
1.0,taxi_driver,such a good film a must see by anyone especially if you have liked other Scorsese movies

1.0,taxi_driver,"A cinematic masterpiece. The rawest, darkest and somehow beautifulest New York I've ever seen on screen, with a sublimely acted ambiguous character and a script that defies clich√©s and never ceases to surprise us. Aesthetically and culturally relevant, this is Scorsese at his best."
1.0,taxi_driver,"One of the best movies ever, Robert De Niro does amazing acting, a life altering tragedy. Stunning and heartwarming in it's own way, you can relate to De Niro's character, and this movie is very interesting"

1.0,taxi_driver,"The city itself is a character, and the atmosphere is unmatched. One of Scorcese and DeNiro's best, if not THE best."
1.0,taxi_driver,"Mesmerizing. Bernard Hermanns haunting final score, De Nero's best performance, and quite possibly Scorsese's best film. One of the finest films ever made."
1.0,taxi_driver,"Robert De Niro at his enigmatic and almost ludicrous best, Scorsese directs what can only be described as a masterpiece."

1.0,taxi_driver,"Yeah, it's a masterpiece and all that good shit."
1.0,taxi_driver,A fabulous screen play & a searing performance from Robert De Niro are just two of the reasons this is a must-see film. Perhaps director Martin Scorsese's best film and that is certainly arguable. Having said that this is one of the greatest films made.  A compelling and important film.
1.0,taxi_driver,"One of Martin Scorce's best. This is #1, Raging Bull #2, then Good Fellas."

1.0,taxi_driver,best martin Scorsese movie by far
1.0,taxi_driver,This is by far one of the best movies of all time. Robert DeNiro plays one of the most distressed and pitiable character. Takes his date to a porno and then... wait til the last scene.
1.0,taxi_driver,"ver a betsy caminar con esa musica de bernard herman es hermoso, deniro hablando con un espejo es increible, un final fantastico, SCORSESE presento al mundo su cine perfecto, es y quedara para toda la vida como una de las mejores peliculas de todo la historia."

1.0,taxi_driver,"One of my favorite films ever. ""Taxi Driver"" is a very elaborate study of the human mind when isolated. It's probably the best directed film I've ever seen, with very good shots that took a lot of gall. Robert De Niro gives it his all in his best performance!"

1.0,taxi_driver,"De Niro's most chilling performance, as Martin Scorsese directs a man on the edge of madness."
1.0,taxi_driver,One of the best movies of the last century for sure. I love the slow burring degeneration and his burning rage against injustice in the big city. So bleak and pitch perfect.
1.0,taxi_driver,"Pretty good sequel to ""Catcher in the Rye"""
1.0,taxi_driver,One word: brilliant.
1.0,taxi_driver,No wonder this is known as the film that started Robert De Niro's career his performance is amazing one of the best drama based genre films out there.

1.0,taxi_driver,Easily my favorite film of all time.
1.0,taxi_driver,"Scorsese criou uma atmosfera sufocante e violenta, deixando a √©poca de ouro de Hollywood para tr√°s. De Niro retratando de forma excepcional uma alma atormentada no caos urbano da antiga Nova York."
1.0,taxi_driver,Wow! Criss que c hot!!!!
1.0,taxi_driver,Taxi Driver is dim and brooding with a hard psychologically-driven character that questions morality and brutality. Arguably Scorsese's most serious of works.

1.0,dolce_vita,"Mastroianni es genial. Fellini relata la historia (sin historia) de la vida, la ""pasi√≥n de la vida"". La belleza inalcanzable de Sylvia, la inocencia inalcanzable de Paola. El vac√≠o del mundo modernos; la esperanza del calor familar de Steiner."

1.0,dolce_vita,"It feels immense, but at the end of the day this is simply about a scared and insecure man's efforts to project false confidence. He keeps his eyes locked on what he believes will satisfy him, only to find that all paths have trials."
0.0,dolce_vita,The most pretentious movie I have ever seen in my life.
1.0,dolce_vita,"A pretty grim and oddly surreal look at the emptiness of wealth and hedonism. Fellini is great as usual here, and I can't help feeling it is a major influence on one of my favorite films, The Great Beauty."

1.0,dolce_vita,Here is a remarkable creation. I have never come away from a movie feeling so simultaneously fulfilled yet empty. It refracts then reflects the viewers' emotional extremes back onto them in ever-changing ways.
1.0,dolce_vita,"La Dolce Vita portrays blissful ignorance as the truth of tragedy. Elegant and suggestive cinematography, some of Fellini's greatest ideas, and a length not ever overblown or tiresome. La Dolce Vita is definitely an Italian masterpiece."

1.0,dolce_vita,"Can't believe I went this long without seeing it, but there are a few I still haven't seen. It pretty much speaks for itself, but I'm left with the question that if the paparazzi world was this decadent in the 60s, what would Fellini make of it today?"
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini's masterful and stunning portrayal of Italian neo-realism is among his best work. No-one can pull off the classic fountain scene like Anita Ekberg.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Beautiful portrait of decadent disillusionment. Endlessly gratifying visuals, and great performances by all. Touching, sad, heartbreaking, yet exciting, and deeply satisfying, if cynical. Fellini's visions of humanity, and the intricate glories of Rome, and Nico. A great big slice of story."

1.0,dolce_vita,The most realistically debauched film ever
1.0,dolce_vita,"I have no idea what this film is about, the symbolism of the sea monster in the ending, the g-rated orgy. Maybe it documents the emergence of the paparazzi or the decline of western civilization. The absurd, the absurd. Very postmodern Rome, Very Fellini."

1.0,dolce_vita,"A more miserable life is better, believe me, than an existence protected by an organized society where everything is calculated, everything is perfect."
1.0,dolce_vita,"Pure Fellini absurdism. The way it was chalked up I was expecting more of the gorgeous Anita Ekberg, but Mastroianni is very magnetic in the film. I was shocked by how beautiful this film was (add another point to bw being more beautiful than color)."

1.0,dolce_vita,"As I had said about Persona, this is one of the few films which I think is perfect. After watching this, I felt like I had just experienced life, hence the title of the movie. The cinematography is enchanting, the acting was as well, and everything about this film was perfect."

1.0,dolce_vita,i thought it was wonderful.
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini is a genius. All eight sequences in this movie stand on their own. The idea that modernism will change man is a fascinating one. This movie seriously changed the way I view movies.
1.0,dolce_vita,It makes it's point so well and so often(too much of a good thing is a bad thing; the disillusionment that comes with excessive decadence.)that it nearly folds over on itself and becomes an example of it's own meaning.
1.0,dolce_vita,"I absolutely love Fellini: Italy, pagentry, blasphemy, sexuality on a grand scale. He is absolutely brilliant and never fails to amuse me. Nino Rotta and the accompanying music is amazing!"

1.0,dolce_vita,"i liked this more than eight and a half. i don't think it is as daring or visually stimulating, but i had a much better time taking it in. it's three hours of chaos but the scenes are short and clever. and unline the other fellini film i feel like this one had more of a pulse."

1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini...need I say more?
1.0,dolce_vita,Images from this movie never quite leave me. Leave it to Fellini to break the narrative format and create something this incredible. It's the first true character piece but with an epic scope of rome. Fellini could say so much with so little. Gets better every time I see it.
1.0,dolce_vita,"This movie is one of my favorites. The movie was just great, I first saw it in my Italian Cinema class and was completely blown away. Great film."

1.0,dolce_vita,"Beautiful performances and gorgeous actors and actresses. Makes you wonder how different and yet similar societies can be across countries and along decades. Bravo Fellini, Bravo!!"
1.0,dolce_vita,"The paparazzi are a bunch of heartless fuckers. Another terribly depressing, terribly brilliant piece from Fellini."
1.0,dolce_vita,"Depressing and haunting, it showcases the perils of a life lead in lust. This movie bites hard, and draws blood."
1.0,dolce_vita,Such a beautiful movie and a wonderful story about trying to find yourself.
1.0,dolce_vita,fellini's masterpiece on the silly accolades we bestow on celebrities
1.0,dolce_vita,Revolutionary -- Fucking fantastic!
1.0,dolce_vita,"Imagenes que quedaran grabadas para siempre en su memoria, una actuacion insuperable a cargo de Marcello Mastroinanni, una cinta construida de manera minuciosa como un exquisito trabajo de relojeria. No hay nada malo en La Dolce Vita."
1.0,dolce_vita,It's funny how this is more relevant today than ever before. You can't doubt the power of Fellini's vision here.
1.0,dolce_vita,"A cinematographic feast in rich, elegant black-and-white. The musical scenes are exquisite. Yvonne Furneaux's eyes almost leap out of the screen. Anita Ekberg makes me think.... Aprhodite."
1.0,dolce_vita,"I would like to be la dolce vita's fly on the roman wall and, maybe, more..."
1.0,dolce_vita,One of the greatest films of ever!
1.0,dolce_vita,quem nao se apaixona pela anita ekberg tomando banho na fontana de trevi tem MUITO do que aprender na vida.
1.0,dolce_vita,This was an amazing movie about exploitation and decadence in the modern world. The soundtrack was good and the acting was incredible.
1.0,dolce_vita,One of Fellini's best...
1.0,dolce_vita,"the languid, sometimes frantic, search for enchantment in the minefield of corruption."
0.0,dolce_vita,"On baille et on s'ennuie avec ce film : pas de dialogue poignant, pas d'effets speciaux, pas de gros calibres,... Fellini aurait du reviser ses classiques americains."
0.0,dolce_vita,"Boring, boring, BO-ring!"
0.0,dolce_vita,"Overated and overlong, it is typically Fellini. Saved only from utter mediocrity by the incredible Marcello Mastroianni and THAT scene with Anita Ekberg, a woman who makes the phrase ""sex-bomb"" seem nuclear powered."
1.0,dolce_vita,"a fellini masterpiece on the personas we create for celebrities, the americanization of europe in the sixties, and so on."
1.0,dolce_vita,second only to 8 1/2
1.0,dolce_vita,only for a select few
1.0,dolce_vita,"whenever I am down, i always think about this movie. It shows that not even in film you get everything you want. Some time we as humans expect everything to come so easily but in reality that doesn't always happens. Fellini is such a master and I will always look up to him."
1.0,dolce_vita,"Anita Ekberg, Marcello, Fellinin, need I say more?"
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini's Masterpiece
1.0,dolce_vita,"Huipputyylikas elokuva, josta loytaa joka katsomiskerralla uutta. Ja se oinen Rooma..."
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini will blow your mind.
1.0,dolce_vita,A great film from the Director-Actor duo Fellini and Mastroianni. Must watch for any serious student of cinema.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Always felt like a bad film buff for having never seen this one. Seen a lot of Fellini, but somehow always managed to skip passed this one.How do you not fall in love with this film? I don't know."
1.0,dolce_vita,The party scene where Anouk Aimee sits Snaporaz down in the lonely room and talks to him via vents...Dat scene is pretty much OFF DA HOOK.
1.0,dolce_vita,Amazingly ahead of its time--it's hard to believe this was shot in 1959. Still shocking and beautiful (and long).
1.0,dolce_vita,"After watching it twice, and fully understanding it...i can safely say, 5 stars x"
1.0,dolce_vita,My first Fellini Movie and one of my top faves.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Yes the film is long, but Fellini is not one of the world's greatest directors for nothing. Love the edgy style, the incredible b/w cinemography. Its one the great classics, a must see."
1.0,dolce_vita,"A brilliant, haunting, and unique. An amazing Fellini film that I saw when I was younger and really want to watch again."
1.0,dolce_vita,I absolutely love this movie!
1.0,dolce_vita,"A masterpeice. Definetly edgey for 1960. I liked how the story was told by following Marcello from scene to scene rather than a flat, run-of-the-mill story. A great cornerstone for the filmmaking world."
1.0,dolce_vita,Masterpiece 50 years old still 50 years ahead of its time
1.0,dolce_vita,"A classic masterpiece! Almost half a century on, it is still so relevant! The easy-going lifestyle of urban young elite, without any depth in relationships, looking for some extra fun, but the morning light brings only dissappointment..."
1.0,dolce_vita,"very impressive, makes you think about lots of things"
1.0,dolce_vita,"I really find amazing how the characters of Dolce Vita are never ready to make a full decision on something. At the same time, their efforts for communication are always uncomplete. Aren't these describe our life, with many opportunites, the next moment leaving us with a bitter sense... Oh Rome!"
1.0,dolce_vita,"This is quite likely my favorite film, period."
1.0,dolce_vita,best fellini!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,dolce_vita,"A Fellini masterpiece. Exuberant and exhilarating. It was both scandalous and thrilling. A smorgasborg of themes reach dizzying heights in this decadent epic dealing with celebrities, paparrazi and debauchery."
1.0,dolce_vita,The best movie of all the times.. Not enough stars to rate this movie
1.0,dolce_vita,"If I had to live in a movie, it would be this one....I know. What does that make me?"
1.0,dolce_vita,Absolutely one of the finest films ever made...
0.0,dolce_vita,"Interesting few film tricks, but mostly long, boring, about nothing, don't bother."
1.0,dolce_vita,This movie left me kind of numb at the end. Almost too much to absorb at once. I love the scene where the balloons follow the clown out of the room. This is a movie I could watch repeatedly and probably never understand fully.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Cynically beautiful, beautifully cynical."
1.0,dolce_vita,"A powerhouse of dialogue, music, humor, sex, and cinematography into one of the most sensual surrealist film. One of the All-Time Best."
1.0,dolce_vita,I can completely relate to Marcello.
1.0,dolce_vita,A mith. Marcello is too sensitive for not recognizing the corruption around him and too smart for not being attracted
1.0,dolce_vita,"The best director from the history made this one for everybody realize that the world is crazy. Marcello Mastroianni in an historica char, a legend scene with Anita Ekber. If shock me in these days, I can Imagine in 50 years ago...."
0.0,dolce_vita,I can never pay attention during this movie. And the presence of Nico just annoys the hell out of me. Not my favorite Fellini.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Stylish, iconic film."
1.0,dolce_vita,I can't really say anything that hasn't been said before. A spot on piece of world cinema directed by a great master.
1.0,dolce_vita,"One of the best movies, but slow and complex. It shares many of the problems we face today with the views of the Italian High society of the 50's. It is a treatise on sociology."
1.0,dolce_vita,Self-loathing has never been so beautiful.
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini's dark side deeply explored. Most people cannot watch this movie. It holds nothing back on the meaninglessness of life. It haunts and haunts you.
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini's dark side deeply explored. Most people cannot watch this movie. It holds nothing back on the meaninglessness of life. It haunts and haunts you.
1.0,dolce_vita,"A miracle of a movie. I won't belittle it by saying more. A film one simply must see (but wait til you are at the age when you start having doubts about the true meaning of life before doing so- even though the film, perhaps rightfully, gives no answer, it will surely feed your own questionings)."
1.0,dolce_vita,"This is exactly the sort of film cinema was invented for, only wish I had seen it years ago..."
1.0,dolce_vita,Seductive and evocative... Its beautiful. I loved this film.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Sad, frustrating, beautiful. Never get tired of this movie."
1.0,dolce_vita,also for fellini...watch more...watch more...
1.0,dolce_vita,Mastroianni was so damn cool! Fellini's characterization of the women in his film is so damn brilliant and the plot structure very inventive. Favorite Fellini film.
1.0,dolce_vita,Seven days and seven nights on the Seven hills of Rome...a scathing indictment of the spiritual decay of the jet-set upper class
1.0,dolce_vita,amazing on so many levels. really one of the best films of all time. and it made me fall in love with marcello. i could say alot more...
1.0,dolce_vita,The only real italian kolossal. For the critic and for the audience. Wanna dance?
1.0,dolce_vita,Beautiful and surreal.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Quite simply the best movie ever made. I could fill my whole list with Fellinis, but I'll settle for this."
1.0,dolce_vita,"This movie is among the top three movies I've seen in my life.Mastroanni beautifully portrays the character Marcello , his likes, dislikes, monotonous parties,sexual encounters and finally the intellectual death....If you watch this movie once you can never forget this stuff in your whole life...."
1.0,dolce_vita,"An erotic, existentialist, and irresistably seductive masterpiece."
0.0,dolce_vita,Worst film I have ever seen. Made me puke.

1.0,dolce_vita,FELLINI ERES GRANDE!!!!
1.0,dolce_vita,"Ahead of it's time,very Hip, Chic, and I love the language...ciao!"
1.0,dolce_vita,Why does this movie seem more and more relevant? It's a must see every other year or so... just so we can see how far we HAVEN'T come when it comes to the banality of pop culture
1.0,dolce_vita,"This is my FAVORITE film! So compelling, a visual and emotional feast. Bravo Fellini!"
1.0,dolce_vita,"Marcello is fantastic again. Following him around Rome into public and personal scenes is compelling indeed, at times uncomfortable and certainly enjoyable as well."
1.0,dolce_vita,Brilliant Italian classic!
1.0,dolce_vita,the world doesnt make movies like this anymore
1.0,dolce_vita,"MI FAVORITA DE FELLINI. QUIZA LA MAS DESOLADORA. LA DECADENCIA DEL ULTIMO TERCIO, SOBRE TODO EN LA FIESTA, ES ALGO CON LO QUE LAMENTABLEMENTE UNO NO PUEDE DEJAR DE EMPATIZAR."
1.0,dolce_vita,"This is one of my favorite movies and my favorite Fellini flick. Its themes still apply to society 100% today and even more so in America than almost 50 years ago in Italy. Marcello's inner conflicts to me are some of the most interesting ever explored on film. Also, Antia Ekberg is beyond amazing"
1.0,dolce_vita,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini is a genius and Marcello Mastroianni could be the coolest man to ever walk the earth
1.0,dolce_vita,nothing sexier than italian cinema than Mastriani in this film-
1.0,dolce_vita,"The best movie from Fellini. Although the story might seem to be tedious, we saw Fellini`s trasforming. His spirit was so connected with Marcello destructed and evaporated."
1.0,dolce_vita,"The most brilliant insight portrait of Italy, in Rome, at the end of the ""roaring '50s"", between gossip, celebrities, and fashion. A masterpiece wonderfully directed by Federico and interpreted by Marcello Mastroianni, his alter-ego on the screen!"
1.0,dolce_vita,"Fucking brilliant from beginning to end. And it's so beautiful, you might not notice that this film is really a condemnation of idolatry in the modern world."
1.0,dolce_vita,I love it. A true great. They just don't make em like this anymore.
1.0,dolce_vita,"A triumph of Italian cinema and one of Fellini's best. After watching it I became oddly attached to it, especially to Marcello."
1.0,dolce_vita,One of the best films ever made.
1.0,dolce_vita,Fucking brilliant. See it.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Boobs. Glorious, gigantic boobs. Redefined the boob film. Also, Marcello Mastroianni and the origin of the Paparazzi."
1.0,dolce_vita,This movie has it all and defines everything that was sexy and wonderful about Roma (and Italy) in the late 50s/early 60s.
1.0,dolce_vita,"O√É¬π l'on se demande o√É¬π peut bien aller J√É¬©sus, qui passe dans le ciel..."
1.0,dolce_vita,True movie magic bliss. Has an endless list of memorable scenes. Fellini at the top of his game.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Lo mejor es esa fiesta media sordida-vip, media surrealista, media patetica, esta pelicula me da la sensacion de estar durmiendo, se parece mucho a los suenos q tengo. 50 anos y sigue haciendo sentido la decadencia y el glamour. Amo a Marcello, esta muuuy weno."
1.0,dolce_vita,I know that 8 1/2 is great but I'm still partial to La Dolce Vita. It's downright magical.
1.0,dolce_vita,May be my favorite film of all time.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Is this movie really 3 hours long? It positively whizzes by. And how can a black & white movie seem so colorful? Oh, and the Nino Rota score -- this one makes the Best of All Time list."
1.0,dolce_vita,It took me some time to trully appreciate how incredible this movie and how many memorable scenes it contains!! LOVE IT
1.0,dolce_vita,just about everything in this movie makes it worth watching... all its strong and weak points (in any opinion) make it unforgettable
1.0,dolce_vita,This is a wonderful film about the sweet life and how fucked up it makes people.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Don't complain about it being slow, it's done in neo-realist style. It's perfect, (Think of this as a great cup of coffee, and 8 1/2 will be your cigarette). And if you didn't leave the film feeling empty and lost, you didn't watch it correctly."
1.0,dolce_vita,Is it Rome? Is it Fellini? Is it Mastroianni (as a journalist)? Or is it simply Anita Ekberg in one of the most famous scenes in movie history?
1.0,dolce_vita,Great script and direction. Marcello is wonderful. Anita looks so sexy in this film. Very unusual and absorbing film.
1.0,dolce_vita,i want to have an espresso and swim in the treviso-fountain with this cool guy carrying me out of the water smoking an of course dry cigarette...
1.0,dolce_vita,"the characters, the black and white shots make this movie unforgettable."
1.0,dolce_vita,"This tremendous movie, full of noise and spectacle, is a well thought-out utterance which provokes very serious thought. The movie I most want to watch again and again until I understand everything. Plus, Ekberg. Oh, and Marcello."
1.0,dolce_vita,An amazing Fellini film.
1.0,dolce_vita,Wonderful. Mesmerizing. A Classic and an iconic film. It deserves it.
1.0,dolce_vita,"you can always enjoy good music, food and girls...make sure you have at least one good suit!"
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini is probably a man with an eye in the future 50 years before...
1.0,dolce_vita,Fellini is so awesome that he's been turned into an adjective (much like Steven Segal). He's not all whimsical and surreal. This message of the movie is pretty grim. We're all fucked. In Italian. With Fountains and cleavage. See it!
1.0,dolce_vita,Perhaps the greatest film ever made
1.0,dolce_vita,What stikes me about this movie is that is amazingly up to date...
1.0,dolce_vita,"Fontana di trevi, know who doesn't wanna swim there??"
1.0,dolce_vita,apperently recreating the fountain is illegal-who would have guessed?
1.0,dolce_vita,There aren't enough adjectives to describe this film. Bravo!
1.0,dolce_vita,NO NEED TO SAY AGAIN.... ROME ROME ROME!!!!!
1.0,dolce_vita,see it on the big screen if you can is all I can say. It's the most lively tragic film ever to come from Italy; Fellini could have only topped himself with 8 1/2. Those who can't stand the papparazzi would do well to see the coining of the term here with a character named Papparazzo
1.0,dolce_vita,One of the few very magical films. Recommended for all to see.
1.0,dolce_vita,"As in most of Fellini's films, you can't stop smiling and being sucked into the circus of his characters and their scenarios. Light never looked so good."
1.0,dolce_vita,"Very surreal movie watching experience. It's like an amazing party that goes on for way too long -- you're tired, you want to go home, but you can't shake the feeling that you'll remember the night for the rest of your life."
1.0,dolce_vita,Great Flick. Very haunting and unreal feeling. Especially Mastrioni's lonely et confident expressions. I love this one.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Enfin r√©ussi √† le voir en entier en une seule fois. Film d√©routant et passionnant, sa structure me pla√Æt beaucoup, r√©alisation et interpr√©tation sans faille."
1.0,dolce_vita,"Fellini is brilliant, always. This is one of his must see films. MUST SEE."
1.0,dolce_vita,perfect . need say no more -- real filmaking
1.0,dolce_vita,You canno't forget any of the marvellous scenes from this neo realistic expression of Italia....
1.0,dolce_vita,Anita Eckberg. Cloning was invented for just such occasions.
1.0,dolce_vita,"Great, Giant,,,masterpiece..."
1.0,dolce_vita,"Master Fellini at his best. The glamour of another era in the world and filmmaking is present in this masterpiece, showing the decadence of the elite in a superb way. Mastroiani and Anita Eckberg are one of the greatest couples in cinema's history. Brilliant."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"Magnificent, ravishing, elegiac. The sets alone are worth the price of admission."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"There is no doubt that this movie is masterpiece, an epic and beautiful mosaic of interrelated conflicts that all culminate into a 45 minute ballroom sequence that is both moving and jaw-dropping."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,Not much more to say except historical epics rarely come as beautiful as this one.
1.0,the_leopard_1963,Great movie. Great piece of film-making with its many riveting scenes and dialogues and incredibly wonderful and colorful actors. This film for the eye is like a long and pleasing song to the ear.
1.0,the_leopard_1963,BEAUTIFUL MASTER'SPIECE

1.0,the_leopard_1963,Probably the best costume drama I've ever seen. One of the most beautiful film's I've ever seen. Watch it.
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"Very little action. Mostly just... circumstance, style, character, history, substance? This is a good movie."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"Why Visconti can be mentioned in the same breath as Fellini and Antonioni. The pinnacle of epic cinema, on par with Lawrence of Arabia."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"One of my four or five choices for best film ever made. Maybe not for everyone, but an extremely rewarding film experiece."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"One of the finest, smartest historical screen epics of the age, or any other for that matter."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,Excellent film. I learned a great deal about Sicilian history.Burt Lancaster was surprisingly believable as a Sicilian Prince. I could tast the dust and feel the heat in those travel scenes
0.0,the_leopard_1963,Definitely not worth 3 hours...an hour of it must have been the kissing and dancing scenes alone. This movie was wayy to slow paced and drawn out than it needed to be.

1.0,the_leopard_1963,"Just saw Luchino Visconti's Il Gattopardo in a restored print at the George Eastman House this evening...my God, what an experience. Clocking in at just over 3 hours, this epic tale of the last years of a Sicilian Prince during the Garibaldi era.On the surface, it is the story of the end of an age"
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"A little like Gone With the Wind, but set in 1860 Italy during the unification. Martin Scorsese says everyone should see this movie....I agree -- it's pretty magnificent. The 35mm restoration is probably playing at an art house theater near you!"
1.0,the_leopard_1963,Nobles also cross the dance flow... Amazing movie: so many details but understatement is still main speech.

1.0,the_leopard_1963,The best film to ever come out of Italy. An all around beautiful movie.
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"An unparalleled historical epic, with an inspired international cast, brilliant directing, gorgeous photography... If you think ballroom scenes are only for those who like to look at elegant clothes and dancing, then the final scene of this film will be a revelation."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"3 hrs and 25 mins. of Visconti directing Lancaster, Cardinale and Delon. You're either on board or you've mizzed the boat. One of the most beautifully filmed movies ever.

1.0,the_leopard_1963,"Tragically ironic and wonderful and joyous. Burt Lancaster gives a truly staggering performance, under the superb hand of Visconti. Claudia Cardinale couldn't be more beautiful and alluring and Alain Delon hits all the right notes. A film whose opulence is never confused by its transience."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,Visconti and neorealism in Italy
0.0,the_leopard_1963,Good acting but way too long. Story is similar to any other aristocratic family; everybody's matched according to the best interest of the family.

1.0,the_leopard_1963,"This is Visconti √Ç¬¥s masterpiece and one of the visually most breathtaking films of World Cinema. Lancaster really is prince Salina. Nino Rota√Ç¬¥s sweeping romantic music, a mixture of Verdi and Wagner, heightens the film√Ç¬¥s visual power."

1.0,the_leopard_1963,"The most gorgeous cinema experience of my life, thank God for re-releases. Operatic, epic, sumptuous, a feast, I am only sad that on DVD, this will never come to life. The look is incredible, still today, cause of Visconti's insistence on the real thing rather than props and scenery."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"An amazing film. Beautifully done. All ""period"" pieces should be held to this standard. Very long, but easy to escape into and feel like you are there."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"Glamour, romance, social commentary, history, family drama, all mixed in this sublime concoction and served cool by Visconti. Watch the Italian version, not the English one."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"One of the most beautiful films ever made, the much famed ball sequence, which takes up the last 1/2 hour is one of the best set sequences ever filmed. The full version is finally available in a subtitled print, however Lancaster spoke English is dubbed into Italian and subtitled back into English!"
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"Class struggles, generational differences and individual morality on Sicily and on a great scale. As awe-inspiring as Gone With the Wind, but at least twice as intelligent."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,certaily the best piece of Burt Lancaster. One of the best films of 60's. And what can be said about Claudia Cardinale.She is the pretiest woman on screen- I guess.
1.0,the_leopard_1963,An absolute gem...what photography...true to the novel in every detail...amazing...but it's Visconti after all...
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"The best way I can describe it, which doesn't do it justice, is the Italian Gone with the wind. However, that's because it takes place during Italy's defining moments. Though the stakes are much more intellectual and thought out than just a tragic love story set against the back drop of war."
1.0,the_leopard_1963,"Que delicioso retrato de la aristocracia y de la sociedad italiana. Que claridad para ver las relaciones sociales entre los habitantes del pueblo, entre el pueblo y el poder. La escena del banquete, la figura y la risa espectacular de Claudia Cardinale son inolvidables."

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,The plot balance is amazing. All-around very well made movie with deep meaning.
0.0,the_rules_of_the_game,I just wasn't really able to follow this. Maybe because I'm sleep deprived. But I also found it hard to care about these characters. Is the point that they're all hypocrites or tritely immoral? Okay.... plenty of people are. Why should I care?
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Talvez a mais precisa e mordaz cr√≠tica √† superficialidade burguesa. Uma obra extremamente pol√≠tica travestida de com√©dia de costumes.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Incredible film. Everything was superb!
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"The brilliance of the film apparently eluded audiences at its release, but seen nowadays, it ranks among the supreme masterpieces of moviemaking."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Very Shakespearian in its tragic elements. We see this tale unravel in complete and utter chaos. It's breathtaking.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,It's overwhelming tragedy makes you crush your heart yet it grows into you oh so fondly.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Overrated. But brilliant. I just think Jean Renoir put out some better material that doesn't get the credit this one does.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A moral narrative on amorality. Enjoyed longer takes in contrast to annoying editting.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Apr√®s ce film de Renoir, le cin√©ma est entr√© dans une nouvelle √®re qui - bien qu'ayant depuis connu maintes innovations et maintes √©volutions - perdure encore √† travers la vision g√©niale de Renoir."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Probably the best cinematic example of using lies to tell the truth. Simply marvelous entertainment.

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A message of substantial proportions, a class of souring sensibilities, La R√É¬®gle du Jeu is powerful, potent and smart."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Jean Renoir is the director who best explains on screen that most people are neither good or bad; but sometimes do good things and sometimes do bad things. He finds humanity in every character.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Absolutely stunning to behold. Renoir's definitive work. Manages to celebrate, condemn, and mourn pre-war french decadence."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"One of the greatest movies ever made, yo. It's like YEEEAAAAHHH MY MAN, JEAN, MAN. HE'S MY BOY. MAH BOY."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Jean renoir's masterpiece The rules of the game is the most authentic and original film of the classic cinema. his vision of the low class with the high class is superb, even when the two classes collide is fantastic, the connection between the poor and the rich and their desires and misadventures."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Not only works as a clever satire of upper class society, but as a precursor to modern affair based films. This may very well be one of the greatest of the silent films I have seen as of yet (though city lights is still my favourite). Excellent!"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"At this point, we've run out of ways to say that this is a great movie."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Terrific. Of course.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Renoir's tragicomedy set in pre-WWII France is an absolute delight. The director's use of deep focus combined with long takes allows the film to progress in a remarkably lifelike manner.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A rule-breaking, jaw-dropping fabulous comedy; a whirling, seething, absolutely scathing look at the French upper class, running pell-mell like lemmings into the sea. One of the greatest, darkest comedies ever made."

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,One of the masterpieces cinema has to offer. The way the camera moves in this is simply amazing. You'll rarely see a movie staged as well as this.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Devastating. Part comedy of manners, part slamming door farce, all wrapped up in a shell of class warfare and their similarities. I am in pure awe of this perfect film."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"It's no insult to call the film an uncompromising, fascinatingly sophisticated echo of Hemmingway's 'The Sun Also Rises'."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,An absolutely sublime film. My 2nd favorite film of all time - following only Les Enfants du Paradis.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Jean Renoir`s satire of human manners is easily one of the most profound and multifaceted films I`ve ever seen!

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Soooooo good. Just brilliant.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"One of those movies you can watch over and over. The characters are shallow and complex, shrill and humorous, affected and vulnerable, all amounting to a tragicomic highwire act of dour resplendence."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"One of the most important films ever made, Revoir's classic stands through the weathering of time, without being rusted a bit."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Other films seem to make more sense after watching a classic, from any decade really. This most certainly is one and it's spellbinding!"

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A Summer's Tale: Again I am in love with a Rohmer's character. It's not hard to guess which one, if you've seen this film. The Rules of the Game: Ah... finally I watched this. Amazing how so much is said, but what is untold carries even more depth."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,One of my all time favourites. Full review coming up.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Every frame of La regle du jeu seems dominated by Renoir's personality; yet the most appealing facets of that personality are generosity, openness, responsiveness. As a result, La regle is at once the auteur film par excellence and a work of co-operation and active participation"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Renoir's painfully brilliant comedy of manners is one of the best films of all, a masterpiece of movement, and a balancing act of character. In the words of Desson Thomson, it is life at its messiest unfolding at its most beautiful."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Renoir truly creates a masterpiece here. A biting look at high society in France at the time, this 'controversial' film is gorgeous nigh its whole length. It's vilification of society is matched in efficacy only by it's humor, which is dark and transgressive."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Often regarded as a precursor to Citizen Kane as the first modern sound film
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A very great masterpiece, 'Rules of the Game"" is to film what ""Don Giovanni"" is to opera--a perfect work of art and the completion of its genre"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Renoir's finest, as I am sure many directors would confess for copying Renoir's style. Obviously better films have been made in the same genre, just remember is was Renoir was the first to make such a film, thus the origionality is his, an no one elses."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A great, sprawling film full of realistic characters, depth, and charm."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A brilliant social commentary that is totally deserving of it's reputation as one of the best film's ever made.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A stunning portrayl of a tottering society on the verge of calamity with countless imitated sequences.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Takes the cinema to places that not other director has gone.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A masterpiece. Also, Jean Renoir in a bear suit. What up."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"For many film lovers, there's Jean Renoir, and then everybody else. Well one look at this astonishing film, and it's hard to dispute such a notion. Rules of The Game may very well be the Citizen Kane of French cinema. Check it out."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Starts slowly, but develops beautifully into a rich space."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,One of the best and memorable French b&w; movies. Satirical look on bourgeoisie is packed with walloping punches from an amazing script and excellent Renoir direction. And that ending is sadly haunting.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"So quintessentially a French cultural experience, it's almost equivalent to the first time one sees Paris at night. Cinematic perfection."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Clasico del cine frances acerca de ""los de arriba y los de abajo"" que en su epoca fue un completo fracaso de taquilla. Ahora es un trabajo absorbente, complejo, lleno de dialogos inolvidables y con una fotografia exquisita. Un trabajo inmortal."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Quite simply one of the greatest movies ever made. An intricately crafted work that never loses touch with the intimate human elements of the characters it depicts. All the more amazing since it seems to be so... effortless.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,In the same league as Citizen Kane in that any descriptions do not suffice this film's grandeur.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Cada vez que ves esta Obra maestra sacas nuevos detalles que antes te perdiste :D
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Though it is my opinion this film is over rated-it's not one of the greatest films, it still deserves a top rating. It's basically about how passions can lead people astray and make them act foolishly. The ending is somewhat shocking and justifiably legendary."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,this one hit me like a ton of bricks.
0.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"I appreciate the satire and that it was good for its time, 70 years ago, but I found it quite boring to watch. Plus they seemed to be speaking too fast!"

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Towering masterpiece from a time when film directors still respected their audience and aspired to communicate something about the human condition. This film as as life-affirming as most contemporary cinema is the opposite
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"The perfect example of a farce, with the added inclusion of a tragic ending."

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Perfect, the ultimate movie. Far too dense to absorb. Every role, every movement, every element of stage, every breath, evey word, eveything has a purpose. The equal of citizen Kane if not superior, really amazing."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Superb comedy of class, manners, behavior. Fine performances. People who like Gosford Park (and Robert Altman films in general) will get a lot out of this one."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,One of the BEST films ever made. period.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"I bought and watched this one cold, only knowing that it was ranked as the number 3 movie of all time in a census of film critics and directors. And this scathing attack of the fickle French bourgeoisie deserves to be there."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A masterful microcosm of Europe on the brink of cultural collapse
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Renoir is charming and funny. He believes in the good in humanity.I'm in love with Octave.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A great movie to revisit at any time - on the grandness and pettiness of love, friendship, and human emotions in general. Unforgettable characters. Jean Renoir is great for an actor, too, not only for a director! Can't believe it's from 1939 - beats anything I've seen from the new century..."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"It's better every time you see it, especially with all the extras in the Criterion Edition."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,psycho...for its time...talk about putting all that has never ever been said upfront..coldly in a movie....thats bravado....
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Oh my yes. One of the best movies ever made. If you're reviewing this movie, then you are familiar with it and I dont have to explain that is a an amazing satire on the class system in 3rd Republic France blah blah blah"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,I remember this film. Saw it way back in College.. FAntastic. ..Now I want to see it again. Renoir--sheer genious

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,There is no reason not to see this.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"This wonderful film is lucky to still be intact after bannings by the French government and burnings of all available copies by the Nazis. That being said, the movie explores the tense relationships between lovers and friends in the pre-War French high society."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Es tan espectacular que hay que verlo para creerlo. Todo es innegablemente excelente, obra maestra de obras maestras. Sin palabras."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Fantastic movie. A must see if you have not done so yet. Picks apart the upper classes and caused a ton of controversy. A must see, I don't know how much more I can stress that."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Classic Renoir. Nuff' said.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"I know the film is about the French pre-war aristocracy, but I loved what it had to say about love, lust, and friendship, and how often they can be concealed or confused."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A great movie for those who love movies. One of the first films ever shot it depth, Rules of the Game is technically far ahead of its time. Beyond that, the characters are well developed, and the implication of montage shows the tension of pre-WWII France as the war draws nearer."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,One of the Cinema's most historically significant and most controversial works is an outstanding irreverent satire of bourgeois sensibilities from the master Renoir.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Considered one of the greatest films of all time. Jean Renoir
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Like ""Gosford Park""? See where it came from here. So much going on in this film, you could watch it ten times and see something new each viewing."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Renoir famously said 'Everybody has their reasons'. This, his most encompassing film, reconciles his obsession with deep staging and focus with his empathy and love for people caught up in their messy lives and problems. Humanist cinemas towering masterpiece."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,This really is the film you can watch over and over and over and keep seeing it as fresh as ever. At least that's how I feel after my fifth viewing. Renoir's films invite you into them - they build walls that set you free to roam within their interiors to discover layers of humanity.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Qu'est-ce tu veux mon vieux, aujourd'hui tout le monde ment...!"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Such a layered film, in plot, theme, and mis-en-scene that it gets better with every viewing."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A rule-breaking, jaw-dropping fabulous comedy; a whirling, seething, absolutely scathing look at the French upper class, running pell-mell like lemmings into the sea. One of the greatest, darkest comedies ever made."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A masterpiece of understatement and half-expressed emotion, with a lot of colorful and interesting characters put through their paces in a narrative that doesn't force anything."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Great dark comedy. Highly recommended.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,The only correct answer to the question; What is the best movie ever made.

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Tout simplement un film brillant. Peut-√™tre plus important encore que ne l'est Citizen Kane. Les longs travellings en chass√©-crois√© dans le couloir de l'hotel sont des moments forts de l'histoire du cinema.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Conveys the hypocrisy and conformity in social circles perfectly. Renoir's best film, perhaps."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,One of the finest motion pictures ever made. Absolutely a masterpiece. I cannot recommend it highly enough.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,En stor og str√•lende film om borgerskapets laster og dyder. I Frankrike f√•r man s√•gar kj√∏pt filmmanuset som en vanlig pocketbok.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,One of the greatest films ever made.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Pretentious, Moi! But it is a devastating look at pre-war French society, which confirms many prejudices. And it is made by a Frenchman, which shatters many more."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A humorous movie that pokes fun at the upper-class. One of the finest in french cinema
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Essential Renoir. It's difficult to find a director with two films bot has good as this and The Grand Illusion. Simply Great.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,It's biting and hilarious - and there is a guy in a bear suit (who doesn't love that?).
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Frankly my all-time favorite movie, nothing matches Renoir's extraordrinary direction or his script and the last image is one of the greatest and most haunting images ever put on a screen"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Vicious and biting, yet somehow still oh so funny, The Rules of the Game is one of the best social critiques on film. Renoir goes right for the throat of the oblivious upper class, and he tears their jugular right out. A classic."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Jean Renoir's 1939 masterpiece is still the most humorous film of any decade. Think of it as a caustically hilarious documentary of the discreet charm of the bourgeoisie.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A biting critique on class -- Renoir's calling card
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Two words: Jean Renoir. No one expresses the inherent bittersweet beauty of the human condition better.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Terrific. Of course.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Jean Renoir (son of the Impressionist painter, Auguste) transforms film into art with this movie. Robert Altman borrowed heavily from ""La Regle..."" for his movie ""Gosford Park"" (also fantastic). An acute observation of the upstairs/downstairs world of high society 1930s France."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Renoir is the bestest.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,This is one of the many important Renoir masterpieces. Dude was a true rebel.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,what can you say about the greatest film right before the beginning of the greatest war?
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A movie by Jean Renoir
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"The original upstairs, downstairs examination. The sheer depth of material that Renoir is able to capture in his long takes is mighty impressive. As is the dramatic but still inherently complex emotionally honest lives of the film's many characters."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Why does PT Anderson love Renoir so much? Well look at how much he takes from him (excluding There Will be Blood). The fluidity of movement and space in this film is just off the charts. Engaging to watch.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"So widely (and wisely) praised now that it's tempting to resist iconoclastically, but this is really a wonderful movie. Notice the incredible use of countryside footage - fields and grasses and grounds. This film looks like no other. It's set and filmed like no other. It's so unspeakably gorgeous."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,This film gets every character right and has to be one of the first to make full use of cinema's possibilities for using space to tell a story.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Another one of those films that is considered among the 'best of all time' that actually lives up to hype. Visually this has to be one of the most sophisticated films ever, but it is never showy or obvious."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,really holds up well to repeated viewings. i think i prefer this one to grand illusion even
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Life is like that, sometimes."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Was surprised at how bad ass this movie is. Classic? Yep. Long takes? Yep. Commentary on the class system? YEP!
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,How can I only be seeing this for the first time? Jean Renoir's story of a disastrous country house weekend in pre-WWII France is a devastating look at the folly of over-reliance on social mores. Essential viewing.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,pretty much a perfect film.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"I was surprised at how modern the characters were in this. I know that seems strange, but considering the year it was released, I didn't expect male-female relationships to be so easy (I see the irony, considering the end)."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A delightfully comic but equally scathing commentary on the hollowness of the aristocratic pre-World War II French society.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Renoir et tous les acteurs sont bons!
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Quite possibly the best film ever made. Moves with such energy and wit. The pace and intense characterization are outstanding! With each viewing, there is always something new to be absorbed. For anyone interested in classic cinema, this is a beast to be reckoned with, in the best possible way."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A ferocious social commentary. If you were to give the script to a studio in these days, there's no way they would fund a production for it."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Brilliant, layered, subtle, I have seen this 3 times and each time I discover something new. The cinematography is breath taking this film is a must!"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"One of the best movies ever made? Yeah, yeah, that's about right."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A must see - french classic - life of the privileged.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Social engagement as sexual revolution. This movie turns your adopted Puritan ideas of 'the way sex should be' on it's ear. What's more, it was made in 1939. Beat that, Closer*.*movie starring Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"One of the most beautiful films of all time, it is so consistent, the acting is superb and Renior is a genius behind the camera and the angles and positioning"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A perfect movie in its way.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Meilleur film francais ever ?
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,One of the all time greats!
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"I've read that a true classic grows with each reading/viewing. That is exactly why this is my favorite movie. I generally don't go in for wishing I could meet people from the past, but Jean Renoir is the exception."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"The movie where Jean Renoir explore the sequence plan and the image great gray scale to tell us a modern 1939 fable about love, jealousy and death between a noble married couple: he is a French man and she is a German woman."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Absolutely perfect in every way. I've watched it dozens of times over the course of my life and find new things to admire in it every time. If this rating system allowed ten stars, that's what I'd award it. Or thirty. Or a hundred."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Almost 80 years old and still standing the test of time. Little known film (outside of critical studies circles) and should be seen by anyone who gets a chance.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Not only a satire on the upper-class, but a full-on indictment of the facades of human nature. ""Is it a comedy, or is it a tragedy? Either way, it's a masterpiece."""
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"The grandaddy of all those rich-Europeans-gather-at-someone's-estate -for-the-weekend movies. Very funny, very tender and very tragic, this has lots to say about life, love and human folly. Should be required viewing for anyone with a heart."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"this film really stands up to all the critical praise. a wild romp through the french aristocracy circa 1939. renoir's classic is hilarious, meticulously filmed, thoughtfully scripted, and ultimately heartbreaking. this is one of the greats."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"paul schrader considers this the film without which there can possibly be no 'film canon.' i whole-heartedly concur. a brilliant, moving, hilarious and painful film, featuring great performances, great photography, and wonderful dialogue."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A Comedy From France? No. The French can't do comedy--not from the same country where Sartre was born. This is a farce-- It hurts to laugh and that was Renoir's point.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A Black and White French film? Really? But it is amazing that this film written about the different classes in French Society still is resonant today. Octave is one of my favorite characters of all time.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Brilliant, lost for words."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,holy shit freaking amazing.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Yeah, it's one of the best films ever made. There's really not much else I can say."

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"An absolute masterpiece, brilliant satire about class in pre-war France."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Incredible movie by Renoir with a clear indigtment of the decaying morals and social uselessness of the upper classes of pre-war France. A true movie masterpiece and a stinging satire.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A Jean Renoir classic, this film truly deserves its place at the top of many film lists."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Once you get to know Jean Renoir, his films are more rewarding with each viewing. To some it may be dry, but it has such strong complexity to how everything is composed. Characters, movement, timing, conversation, cinematography, DEEP FOCUS, all utilized to gratifying extent."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,An almost perfect mess of drawing-room farce and biting social comment from master director Renoir (son of Auguste). The hunt scene has to be seen to be believed.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"absolute brilliance! a truly bold statement on class rules, and the sheer uselessness of idle people. you may not get it's greatness right away, and thats the brilliance of it. it is so subtle, that it takes a while after viewing it for the true meaning of the film to sink in. a true masterpiece"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"A phenomenal film that needs to be seen several times in order to fully appreciate (or even just understand) it's reputation as one of the ""greatest"" movies ever made."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,One of the best French films ever made.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"This is it, folks. This is the film That Which No Greater Can Exist."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Love, real love is when someone is there to help you get out of the bear suit. That thing that people do at their chateaux on hunting weekends--that's not love, just a game that simulates it."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A fascinating look at the alien world of the French upper class before World War II. Essential.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Some critics have called it the greatest film of all time. It's certainly in the running. Highly influential, justifiably so."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Jean Renoir's magnum opus.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Starts off a little slow, but once it gets going its definitely a treat. Renoir's look into class is as fascinating as the characters in the film, but the real achievement of the film is the technical skills displayed- simply outstanding. 9.5/10"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Classic, influential, funny, tragic, and just perfect."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Top 5 movies of all time. The plot is a simple comedy. But the filmmaking skills on display here may never be equalled.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Renoir is one of my favorite directors. If you want to know why just see this gem of a movie that ranks amongst the best movies ever made by anyone in any country.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Renoir's virtuosic dissertation on class relations has remained as fresh as ever, influencing an entire generation of filmmakers from Altman to Godard."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,This is on my top ten favorite movies
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Robert Altman (my favorite director) once famously said ""I learned the rules of the game from The Rules of the Game."" And Altman may be the only director who's shown that he has the breadth of vision that Renoir has in his masterpiece, one of the small handful of the greatest films ever made."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"If I had 5 films to take with me to a desert island, this would be number one. It's a film that you can't reasonably begin to appreciate the first time, and each time after 10, you dicover how awe is a boundless state."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"If an alien species descended upon Earth and asked me to explain to them what is cinema, I wouldn't say a word. I would simply sit them in front of a TV set and show them two films: Citizen Kane and The Rules of the Game."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"It may not have the distinctive look of 'Citizen Kane' or the thrills of Hitchcock, but this is as perfect as films get: fluid, alternately comic and tragic, always graceful in presentation... with just a little bit of sex"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Brilliant. One of the best of all time.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A humanist masterpiece!
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"If you want to learn how to move a camera, all you need to do is watch any Renoir film, especially this, his masterpiece."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Amazing film. Way before its time. The music and cinematography are wonderful.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,If only the French could make more like this.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Pre WWII France. On the same plane as 'Kane.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,A wonderful early masterpiece.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,this one is up there.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"One of the four or five best movies ever made, a tantalizing ambiguous portrait of morality, honor, and propriety, with rich characters and incredible photography."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,JADORE ce film. the critique renoir makes is brilliant.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,In my top 5 for sure. By far the best French film of all time by my second favorite director Jean Renoir.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"greatest film ever, period. End of discussion."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"One of the greatest of all time. The camera is a character, exploring and discovering just as much as any of the actual characters. It is funny, sad, and everything in between. It is the elegy to a society that is destined for, and meant for, extinction."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"It's the ending that makes the entire movie worthwhile for me. Good stuff overall; don't let expectations of it being ONE OF THE GREATEST MOVIES EVERRRRRR get in the way of just enjoying it, either."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Early cinematic movie, therefore it's very dramatic but in a good way because it's not too exaggerated. The cast was perfect and there is a surprise ending, but the beauty of this ending is not in of itself--it is NOT the climax of the movie.......you'll just have to watch it"
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Easily the greatest movie ever made
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Renoir is just amazing...
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,All-time best Renoir? Hard to choose just one...
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Wow, one of my favorite movies. Renoir really knew how to capitalize on multiple levels of action, and really knew how to play with emotions and test our acceptances of societal conventions. If you like older movies, you definitely have to see this one."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Renoir's brilliant satire of bourgeoisie. Focusing on the lives of many characters and intertwining them perfectly during a weekend hunting trip, this film is one of the greats."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Renoir. With the craftsmanship of his father, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Jean paints a satirically delicate and critical portrait of French aristocracy. Easily outshines The Grand Illusion in my opinion."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"What ""Gosford Park"" wishes it was. Brilliant."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,By far the greatest film EVER made.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Renoir's statement on the bourgeois is done so well. Contains one of my favorite scenes of all times.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Worth seeing just to see Jean Renoir in a bear suit.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Truly one of the classics of film. I am baffled when I heard about all of the people that disliked it upon initial release. This film is absolutely awesome. Renoir was definitely a master of his craft.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Renoir handles the politics of class, sex and (quite literally) the boundaries within and outside le chateau with such deft and artistry. Such a great work of dialogue and imagery-- a striking and potent commentary of a Europe at the edge of another World War."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,Beautiful. That is all.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"Jean Renoir may be the greatest of all time, and this is his greatest film."

1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"one of the greatest movies of all time, ever. took a few viewings to see what was really there, but it is an incredible play of characters and stories, intertwining and paralleling, producing symphonic moral tale. renoir himself stands strong amidst a great cast."
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,I've really grown to cherish this more and more over the years.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,This movie almost single-handedly got me into non-English films.
1.0,the_rules_of_the_game,"I always heard the name Jean Renoir tossed around as if he was a good director with movies worth watching. Well, for what I've seen in this, he is a good director with movies worth watching unless you love rabbits. Renoir doesn't love rabbits."

1.0,wages_of_fear,This film kicks your fucking head in
1.0,wages_of_fear,"Totally jaw-droppingly AWESOME must-see film with scenes of iconic and impeccable magnificence. A landmark of French cinema, and easily one of the true greats of all time"
1.0,wages_of_fear,best movie about driving nitro-glycerine filled trucks through the jungle ever made. Suprisingly subtle too given the less than tactful source material. Great movie.

1.0,wages_of_fear,"Brilliant film! Once you get past the slow start, with all the characters established, it really pays off with sheer suspense."
1.0,wages_of_fear,The most suspenseful film I have ever seen. I didn't think mere sounds and simple images could cause me to gasp as many times as I did throughout this film. Hitchcock was right to admit Clouzot was a true master of suspense.
1.0,wages_of_fear,Outstanding adventure movie
1.0,wages_of_fear,So freakin' intense!
1.0,wages_of_fear,"The perfect film, slow moody start to build the sense of place. Then the journey where it could all go at any moment, and a proper hollywood ending (not). You hate everyone in this movie and quite possibly yourself for a few hours at the end, awesome."

1.0,wages_of_fear,"When I think of movies I've seen that had me on the edge of my seat, I always think of this one. There are some scenes where the tension is more than I can stand."
1.0,wages_of_fear,One of the best ever.
1.0,wages_of_fear,"Once the slow-moving first act of the movie paves way to the second, ""Wages of Fear"" is almost nonstop tension up until the very end, with a brilliantly edited montage shifting between... well, I wouldn't want to give it away."
1.0,wages_of_fear,"Pulse pounding movie by suspense maestro Henri-George Clouzot who also made the original ""Diabolique"". This French movie was remade by William Friedkin as ""Sorcerer"". Both films are exellent but check out this one first. Over fifty years old and still much, much better than most movies today."
1.0,wages_of_fear,"Unforgettably riveting, one of the most gripping films ever made yet poweful commentary on greed and oil."

1.0,wages_of_fear,"This film is unbelievably good. It might take a little while to get going, but once it does, you're on the edge of your seat throughout. Tension is built up mercilessly in scene after scene, and its got one of the best endings I've ever seen. Genius."

1.0,wages_of_fear,"A classic of suspense and a must see. It sounds cliche to say, but it literally kept me on the edge of my seat, without any stupid murderous axemen, psychotic hotel managers, or any real clear-cut ""villains"" at all."
1.0,wages_of_fear,Wow.Now that's suspense
1.0,wages_of_fear,Outcasts hired to drive transport trucks full of nitroglycerine have to literally inch the trucks through miles of treacherous mountains without jostling the contents or they will explode. One of the most tense movies I have ever seen.
1.0,wages_of_fear,"Wonderful sense of place and time, the decay of the South American village and feeling of dread is perfectly pitched. The line ""Where there's oil there are Americans"" still rings true today. And the last 45 minutes ratchets up the suspense unlike any film since. Toughest film ever made."
1.0,wages_of_fear,"A.K.A ""Le Salaire de la Peur,"" it's excellent French Cinema. Don't expect to be bored because it's old, black and white, and French. This is suspense beyond reason, with an ending... well, i can't give it away, can I? A masterpiece by a director who's, dare i say it, the French Hitchcock."

1.0,wages_of_fear,"AN absoluetly excellent French movie about four bums that get chosen to drive a bunch of nitroglycerine across rugged terrain. Way ahead of it's time. The suspense is killer. Yeah it's 2:30 long and it's in french, but it's well worth your time."
1.0,wages_of_fear,"Most tense film ever! Very simple idea, brilliant direction and photography, awesome acting...Classic."
1.0,wages_of_fear,Bowled over by this classic. Starts off like one of those Huston/Hawks pictures with Yves Montand in the Bogart role; gets very suspenseful and intriguing. Great movie.
1.0,wages_of_fear,"Classic. What other movie has men driving trucks with one ton of liquid nitrogen over the Andes mountains? Slow at first, but picks up pace after the first hour. If you like classics, don't skip this one."

1.0,wages_of_fear,"Suspense film touchstone, political lightning rod."

1.0,wages_of_fear,"One of the finest, tensest thrillers ever filmed, Clouzot's devilish misanthropy makes for electric cinema. Fights it out with The Godfather, Citizen Kane and Chinatown for the Best Film Ever Made title."
1.0,wages_of_fear,"The first half an hour or so seems like a bit of a slog at first, but persevere and you'll discover the most intense suspense-filled couple of hours ever put to celluloid. If you like this, check out Clouzot's Diaboliques - another little known masterpiece"
1.0,wages_of_fear,"Should be listed next to ""white-knuckled"" in the dictionary. Why William Fredkin through he could remake this is beyond me."
1.0,wages_of_fear,Sweatiest movie ever with Alien and Cool hand Luke taking second and third. The tension is fabulous and you can feel the jungle heat. Spielburg should have watched this before hacking out Jurassic Park.
1.0,wages_of_fear,Best suspense film ever? Maybe so.
1.0,wages_of_fear,The most suspenseful movie I've ever seen. Brilliant and beautiful. Clouzot's wife plays one of the sexiest bar maids ever in a small role.

1.0,wages_of_fear,The most nerve-wracking film I've ever sat through. I gripped my chair the entire time and at one point thought I might have a heart attack. To see this film is to know Hitchcock wasn't the only master of suspense out there; Clouzot was in a league of his own.
1.0,wages_of_fear,One of the most nerve shreddingly suspenseful films I've ever seen. A misanthropic masterpiece. I had bitten my fingernails off by the end of it.

1.0,gone_with_the_wind,BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!:)
1.0,gone_with_the_wind,An absolute classic of the old world with an impossibly good performance from Vivien Leigh. Full review later.
1.0,gone_with_the_wind,A true classic in every way. Probably two of the most tragic characters ever portrayed. They do everything to make the audience dislike them but their circumstances and the depth and complexity given to them by Gable and Leigh make them two of the most memorable characters in film history.
1.0,gone_with_the_wind,Absolutely epic in scale while staying totally human. Gone with the End is truly a great picture
1.0,gone_with_the_wind,wonderful movie √∞???

0.0,carol,"If you are looking for a slow-as-molasses paced, artsy-fartsy movie about a sexual relationship between two women, that has barely any sex in it, then this movie is for you. Can't believe this movie merits an ""R"" rating. Very tame and pretty lame."
1.0,carol,"Pretty much my new favorite movie, or at least tied with my favorite, Sunset Boulevard (which is actually shown in Carol). Obssessed."

0.0,carol,so boring and very slow.
1.0,carol,"Following in the foot prints of his ""Far From Heaven"", Todd Haynes proves once again that he is a master of exploring the forbidden, repressed sexuality of the 1950's.

1.0,carol,My favorite movie and made me fall in love with the talents of Cate Blanchett

1.0,carol,Amazing! Loved it! Beautiful story.
1.0,carol,a romantic relationship between two women in the early 1950's where these kinds of relationships were considered taboo and many thought having psychological treatments or threatening lawyers could get you to change your mind on whom you love or loved. excellent actors and storyline.

1.0,carol,"Outstanding, emotionally overwhelming movie that captures the essence of the early 1950s and the storms that erupt around falling in love.

1.0,carol,Carol is far from heaven! Cate Blanchett is brilliant
1.0,carol,A beautiful heart wrenching movie.
0.0,carol,Possibly the most boring predicable movie ever made.
1.0,carol,AH-MAZINGHaynes' direction and attention to detail is superb. The real star of the show here is an unattainable life of love between the characters played by Blanchett and Rooney. Blanchett is an amazing actress and it's difficult to look at anyone else when she's onscreen.
0.0,carol,"ABURRIDA, PREDECIBLE."
0.0,carol,"You can summarize this as ""lesbians smoking in the 50's"". I fell asleep for 30 minutes during the movie. Highly overrated."

1.0,carol,"Excellent movie, love the feeling between two girls."
1.0,carol,Blanchett and Mara deliver a deeply felt love story. It's film-making as natural as breathing. Probably the most romantic and beautiful movie of recent years.
0.0,carol,By Far the worst movie of the year... over the top acting. Baffled by the reviews. Go see it. Tell me I am wrong.
0.0,carol,"This movie put three members of my family to sleep. It's long periods of people just talking and sitting, speaking softly while soft piano music rolls over random broll. Omg it was so boring"
1.0,carol,flawless. would give 6 stars if I could.
1.0,carol,Blanch et in running for best actress without a doubt. Mara as in best supporting role. Great movie!
1.0,carol,One of the year's very best films!
1.0,carol,"An absolutely gorgeous film that makes you both long for (the clothes, the style, the elegance, the manners) and loathe (the paternalistic dismissiveness, the repression, the judgmental attitudes) the 1950's."
1.0,carol,"Spectacular--one of the best films I have seen in a while. Blanchett remains in my estimation the best actress of our time. Mara is evocative of Audrey Hepburn. A timeless love story that anyone can appreciate, scripted and acted beautifully."

1.0,carol,De lo mejor del a√±o.
1.0,carol,"A superb film in so many respects. Not as misanthropic as the source material, which was a shame, but all directors need to make certain concessions for commercial appeal. Blanchett's performance is stunning and Mara is something of a revelation. This is a jaw-droppingly beautiful film."
0.0,carol,TURGID - THE FINE ACTING DID NOT MAKE UP FOR THE CREEPING PACE AND poor writing.
1.0,carol,Brilliantly Flawless!! Oscars for Blanchett & Mara!
0.0,carol,This is just more homo-erotic baloney from Hollywood. So sad to see Cate Blanchett sink to the level of political correctness rather than art. A total waste of time.

1.0,carol,"Excellent! Best film of 2015, no doubt."
1.0,carol,"An engaging story, but the cars, model trains, and dolls make it great. You gotta love a flick with scenes in a 1950s department store. The road scenes are not as eligant but wonderful in their own way."
1.0,carol,"Best film this year, Cate Blanchett delivers once again with Rooney Mara bringing an equally great performance. Perfect cinematography, a moving soundtrack, and a story that will break your heart."
1.0,carol,So well done! Love the 50's feel - all the through the window shots.

1.0,carol,Cinematic genius....captivating and haunting.
0.0,carol,"Pretentious and simple minded. A repressed person's view of repressed sexuality, presented with a complete lack of subtlety or nuance."

1.0,carol,Only way to describe this film; exquisite!! Easily one of the best films of the year!
1.0,carol,"There is nothing about this film which is not beautiful. The acting, the setting, the costumes and the plot were utterly flawless. It was romantic but not in a wet Nicholas Sparks way. It was dramatic but not over the top. I honestly cannot fault it"
0.0,carol,so I'd say this is like watching paint dry but I hate to disparage paint... i though first that probably there was a good 10 minute movie in here trapped inside the body of a 2 hour movie.. but really that would really only be watching a smaller patch of paint dry.
0.0,carol,"Slow, self important, coasting along and assuming we care."

1.0,carol,"One not to be missed! Beautifully directed, brilliantly acted. Best movie I've seen in awhile."

0.0,gravity_2013,"The biggest disappointment of an movie in cinematic history! The audience and critics alike fail to see the awful story telling, scientific inaccuracy's, and poor character development. Gravity is the story of the most clueless, delusional, and pathetic astronaut in history."

1.0,gravity_2013,Excellent acting by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney!. Both were very convincing in their roles! Alfonso Cuaron is a genius to be able to bring space so convincingly near to you! Well Done!
0.0,gravity_2013,The worst script ever.
1.0,gravity_2013,"Grade - AWith some of the best CGI I've ever seen and good performances from Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, the only thing stopping 'Gravity' from becoming a perfect film is its script."
1.0,gravity_2013,Gravity is one of the greatest space movies I've ever seen. Its so realistic it seems to have really been filmed in space.
0.0,gravity_2013,"This movie was foolish and illogical. The only gravitational pull was the inexplicable draw of disasters to Sandra Bullock, despite the laws of physics and aerospace dynamics. I would give it a zero, but that won't register on this voting system."
1.0,gravity_2013,A very technical movie with much realistic technical input. The movie takes you as soon as your in space and warps you 96 minutes later that felt like 30 minutes.
0.0,gravity_2013,"This has to be the most overrated movie I've ever seen. Clooney and Bullock were so boring to watch that I completely lost interest. The scenery and cinematography were great, but the story/characters were lame throughout the entire film. 1/5"

1.0,godfather_part_ii,"After visiting cuba last year, I wanted to watch GFII agaub for the Cuban scenes. This may be the best American movie ever. The story, acting, lighting, music can not be touched. I watch this movie mesmerized although I have seen it dozens of times."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"It's hard to say whether or not Part II out did Part I, but it's definitely just as good."

1.0,godfather_part_ii,(98/100)A great follow up that doesn't go down in quality. Loved the flashbacks to Vito's youth.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Puntaje Original: 9.5Lo m√°s cercano a la perfecci√≥n de una pel√≠cula. Es muy dif√≠cil hacer una secuela mejor que la original y mucho m√°s dif√≠cil si hablamos de El Padrino. Sin duda este es un hito hist√≥rico de la cinematograf√≠a.

1.0,godfather_part_ii,"10 out of 10:They took one of the greatest films of all time and made a sequel that held up to expectations. The acting and cinematography are as good, costumes are well done, and it's a bit more powerful than the original. The Godfather Part II is as good if not a bit better than the original."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"The best sequel till date which draws on brawny, powerhouse performances by Al Pacino and Robert De Niro coupled with immaculate direction by Francis Ford Coppola. Second masterstroke by him after the prequel indisputably."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Just as incredibly well made as it's predecessor, I'm genuinely at conflict as to which one of the the two masterpieces I enjoy more. Part II shows us some of Vito Cor"

1.0,godfather_part_ii,"So riveting to see Michael Corleone's journey from when we first see him as the young war hero who isn't involved in the family business in The Godfather to the man at the end of this movie, who SPOILER ALERT, has his own brother killed. Once again, brilliant filmaking. Brilliant everything."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,This is the best made film of all time. The parallel stories of Vito and Michael Corleone are a brilliant combination of prequel and sequel all in one.

1.0,godfather_part_ii,"It mirrors the original in a few ways, but it never duplicates it. With ""The Godfather Part II"" we excel beyond the story of the original film. Though, in my opinion, we never quite reach the cinematic heights."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Surprisingly better than the first film. The Godfather: Part II brings in one of the best performances of all time by Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, Godfather: Part II as well as Part I are the best gangster dramas of all time arguably."

1.0,godfather_part_ii,The greatest sequel ever made.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The Godfather part 2 is one of the greatest movie sequels ever made and one of director Francis Ford Coppolas greatest achievements in film and probably one of the greatest gangster movies of all time.

1.0,godfather_part_ii,"The greatest ever sequel, even surpassing the original."

1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Could be the second greatest movie ever made, definitely greatest sequel ever made."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Maybe better than the first film, The Godfather: Part II packs a stronger punch of gang violence, storytelling, twists, family dynamics, and powerful acting. A clear definition of a what makes a great sequal"
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Maybe from a professional point of view the first Godfather is better but for me this is the best and favorite episode of the trilogy and therefore in my humble opinion it's one of the 3-5 best movies of all time.

1.0,godfather_part_ii,"There are very, very few sequels that are better than the original and this one stands at the head of the class. DeNiro comes into his own and Pacino deepens his Michael Corleone."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Second greatest mob movie ever( tied with Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas).
1.0,godfather_part_ii,This is my favorite one of Godfather Series.
0.0,godfather_part_ii,"Terrible. Utter was of time. The plodding dialog, the vacant plot, the ""I HAD AN ABORTION"" repeated 3 times to chase away the demons didn't work. It was a balled up pile of crap that shouldn't have been executed like Capt. McCluskey was in the first Godfather."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The greatest sequel of all time following the best film of all time and Pacino and De Niro bring it home.

1.0,godfather_part_ii,Words cannot describe how good The Godfather is
1.0,godfather_part_ii,An inch away from being superior to the original.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"""Tony likes it when they go back to Italy. The crickets."" Well, Mr. Soprano is not alone, the scenes with Deniro in Italy and Al in Cuba are unforgettable. No other sequel has come so close to the glory of the first movie."

1.0,godfather_part_ii,No words need be said: Part II

1.0,godfather_part_ii,Pacino's third best role!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Still to this day one of the finest movies made. Pure class. There was a time I could happily watch all 3 back to back. Despite the reviews of the 3rd film, the finale had every inch of class the first films had and would leave me wanting to play them again and again and..."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"A sequel to, arguably, the greatest film ever made would be difficult to pull off for any film maker, but Francis Ford Coppola uses his steady hand at direction to craft a film that is only a fingertip away from it's predecessor's magnificence."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Almost as good as the original. Poor Freddo Corleone - the second son. He should have had a more important role. Even as a baby he is a bit sickly. Very interesting to see how Vito becomes a Don as it would have been so easy for Vito to be only a Capo or even work for Fanuucio.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,A truly legendary film. There's a reason for that too.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"I take it back, THIS is the greatest mob movie of all time. As close to perfect as you can get!"

1.0,godfather_part_ii,"I count the first and second Godfather movies to be the same movie, and the third one to be some strange sequel that didn't really need to happen. That being said, all the hype is worth watching the first two. Incredible."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Literally the second best thing to happen to cinema
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Superior to the original.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Best mob movie of all time. Two movies in one. Only movie that completes a trilogy with only two movies. Should have stopped here. It is rare that a sequel beats out its predecessor - especially this movies' predecessor.

1.0,godfather_part_ii,One of the 5 best movies of all-time and that's putting it conservatively. It may be the greatest film of all time. Pacino's performance is so subtle that it's haunting. The parallel between him and his young father is a dynamic that will never be matched.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Uma continua√ß√£o t√£o boa e eficiente como o primeiro filme da trilogia!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The 2nd greatest gangster film ever made.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The trilogy as a whole is greater than the sum f it's parts
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"this does deserves 5 stars,having a dark,depressing,exciting story plot for the godfather part II"
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"One of the best movies ever made, only second to the original Godfather. It is a movie that can be watched and still shocked and awed by the gruesome reality of twisted family loyalty."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Great classic movie!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"I had to change my rating because i did like this one more than the first, i thought 3 hours seriously? But this movie is so good i didn't mind at all.

1.0,godfather_part_ii,A truly extracorporeal experience.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Perfect sequel to a perfect movie.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"As the sequel to a great mobster film, many expected this film to not achieve the hype of the original, those people were wrong. Dazzling sequel, with great performances by Al Pacino and Robert DeNiro."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"One of the best sequels ever made. Blends both the rise and fall of the Corleone family. In my opinion, this film surpasses the original, simply because it brought itself to newer heights. It took risks and it succeeded. It's ambitious and powerful. It's a true piece of art and drama to admire."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,See comment on The Godfather
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"One of the few sequels that could be considered superior to the original, The Godfather, Part II matches and perhaps even outshines its legendary predecessor."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Robert De Niro es muy joveeeeen. Woooow. Qu√© fr√≠o se ha vuelto Michael. :P Al Pacino es un actor para admirar.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The best movie ever!

1.0,godfather_part_ii,"My all time favorite movie. If it's on, I'm watching it! 6 stars."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"It is truly an insult to call this film a sequel. It is much more of a companion piece to Part 1. Robert De Niro and Al Pacino both give mesmerizing performances, and Al Pacino more than deserved the Oscar. One of the greatest films of all time, and by far the greatest ""sequel"" of all time too."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The legacy continues.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Best of the trilogy. Pacino's performance as a morally desensitized Michael Corleone is amazing. De Niro's presence is definitely a plus.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Sequels really can be better than originals. Much better than I.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,This is a more complex and compelling tale of the Corleone Family. De Niro is incredible in his flashbacks as Vito and Pacino's struggle to maintain control of his family is so complex that it feels real.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,oh yeah and fuckin Robby de niro bitches!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"The greatest sequel ever made, period."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,great move one of my favorites

1.0,godfather_part_ii,Best mobster movie ever.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Epic mafia continues :-)
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The Godfather Part II. Flawless. 10/10
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Just as good as the first if not better. This is an intense film.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"A perfect followup to the First Film, But it could stand on it's own. Worth every moment of watching it."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"I feel the best of the Godfather films. It intertwines two stories young Vito and Michael becoming a stronger, more powerful head of the family with designs on expanding his empire. Deniro and Pacino are great."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,greates mouvie franchise ever.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Everything I said about the first film can be applied here with twice the respect as this is the better film but has no actual bearing without seeing the first one. This is the main coarse of the trilogy and it certainly does not disappoint.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,An absolutely terrific piece of cinema history.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Sangre azul. Brillante como siempre.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"I didn't think it was possible, but I may have liked this one more.... whhaaat?? But no joke, the parallel journeys of Vito and Michael were fabulous and when I'm usually impartial to Robert De Niro, I think him (basically) impersonating Marlon Brando was just excellent."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Gr8t sequel to a classic and a classic in its own right I really canot say much about this epic that has not been said already.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Again, along with part I, the greatest American films ever."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Arguably better than Part 1.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Surpassed only by its predecessor, second greatest movie of all time. Period."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Sequel to the best mafia movie!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Oh wait. You throw DeNiro in there that's how. One of the greatest films ever made.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,I miss the Pacino we see in this movie. What happened to the subtle brilliance on display here? DeNiro is also awesome. The inevitable ending is like a punch to the gut. Excellent from start to finish.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"The rarest of things. The sequel outshines the orginal. The two Godfather movies are, to me, the pinnacles of what I go to the movies for in the first place."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Shows how criminals sometimes think themselves to be heroes. Shows the Italian experience in America
1.0,godfather_part_ii,One of the greatest movies of all time!!!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Possibly the best sequel ever made.

1.0,godfather_part_ii,sencillamente brillante
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Definently as good if not better than the first Godfather movie. The story in this movie is competely original and Pacino is great as usual.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Despite the lack of Marlon Brando, Robert DeNiro takes over as a young Vito Corleone, immigrating to the U.S. in the early 20th century. This film serves as both a prequel, sequel, and conclusion to the Godfather films. The third one never happened, right?"
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Original rating Spring 2008.

1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Fredo getting capped on the lake, DeNiro taking down the neighborhood don during that parade, and so on and so on. Arguably better than the first and I will say that I like it more than the Godfather, which is awesome as well."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,See my Godfather review I reiterate what I said then.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Better than the first.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,A rare sequel that is just as good as its predecessor but trumps it in the raw intensity of its even more exciting subject matter. Excellent cinema... And one hell of an ending.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The best gangster film ever.... Part II was such an epic chapter i wished it was the last before Part III..... The history of Don Corleone is amazing with also the bigger rise of Michael Corleone.... The film is an epic and must be seen if your interested in gangster films......
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Probably the best of the trilogy.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,One of the greatest movies of all time. End of.

1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Love, love, love it!"
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"As much as I hate to admit it, this movie expands (and improves upon) its predecessor. Filmed on a grand scale, with rich sepia tones, and seamlessly weaving between Michael's present and Vito's past, The Godfather Part II is a flawless masterpiece."

1.0,godfather_part_ii,The Second Greatest Movie Ever Made!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Absolutely stunning. A magnificent piece of art by FFC. Just as good (if not better) than the first one. Again unparalleled acting by all the cast members.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,A sequel even better than its original? Not impossible.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,I defy any male to dislike this classic great !!!

1.0,godfather_part_ii,Far darker and even more ambitious in scale than the original.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,My favorite of the movies
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"The only sequel to win best picture oscar; it continues the story of the original. Brando is gone, but his character is played as a young man by Robert DeNiro. With an appearance by method actor teacher Lee Strasberg, who taught many great actors. Starring Al Pacino, Diane Keaton and Robert Duvall."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,the best movie ever but part 2 decreased sense of part 1
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"""I can handle things. I'm smart, not like everybody says, not dumb. I'm smart, and I want respect!"" Possibly the best acted scene of all time?"
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Robert De Niro. That is all
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Nothing can be so much better then a sequel that depicts lives of two dons of different eras.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,cmon...like u have to ask
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Not quite the original, but Pacino's still great"
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"part 2 was better than one.. though one wa needed. Godfather 2; helped explain the history.. the gradual gravitaion towards Al""s Dynasty Classic"

1.0,godfather_part_ii,"great film the only problem I had with it, it was just too long, 3 hours and 20 mins is too long for me, after 2 hours and 40 mins I was getting fed up, it was a good film and it was directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It starred Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Robert De Niro"
1.0,godfather_part_ii,La segunda mejor de las 3.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,How they made a film that was arguably even better than the magnificent first installment is still a mystery...deservedly the only sequel ever to have won the best picture Oscar...
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The Godfather 2 is in many ways superior to the first Godfather and is definitely one of the best sequels ever made. The ending is perfect and there honestly wasn't a need for part 3.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Al Pacino ups his game as he officially becomes the Don of the Corleone Crime Family. It is a sequel rarely matched, breaking a lot of records with its accolades."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,My favorite movie of all time! This one of those rare films were the sequel is better than the original.

1.0,godfather_part_ii,Coppola's second classic of the 70s.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The Godfather and The Godfather Part 2 should be placed next to each other in the movie hall of fame for best one-two punch of filmmaking genius..
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The movie will make your emotions run like crazy. There's just too much to respect about this film.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,i liked this one also...goes back and forth ..took talent of al pacino..robert duvall and schowcased them...another must see
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Al Pacino is simply mind blowing.

1.0,godfather_part_ii,What a bliss to get to see the timeless classic on restored DCP copy on a major screen! Filmmaking at its best. Coppola's remarkable achievement in film history. Flawless ensemble. And so on and so on.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Darker and wider than part 1, Godfather part 2 is perhaps the most successful sequel to date, combining themes of a wide range to encapsulate the dark nature of its characters and the business of immorality."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,I Like All The Godfather Movie's !
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"muy pocas secuelas son dignas de sus antecesoras, Coppola complementa su trayectoria con esta nueva joya, a destacar la interpretaci√É¬≥n de Robert De niro"

1.0,godfather_part_ii,A story. A Saga. An Epic. Better than the first. Pacino is riveting even without lines. A masterpiece.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"The sequel to one of the best movies ever made, Godfather II launches even deeper within the intricacies of the mob while showing off great insight within Michael's psyche in comparison with his father's rise."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Better than the first. . . or just a continuation of the inherent greatness?
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"If I could give this 6 stars I would.... in my opinion, it beats the first one..."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,better than the 1st wich is rare.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,This was my favorite of the three movies and that doesn't happen often if not ever

1.0,godfather_part_ii,So which one is better: Part 1 or Part 2?
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"An extreme rarity, a follow up movie that is at least as good as its predecessor, if not better. A fabulous prequel and sequel in one that shows a more (and less) human side to the family. Again, not a wasted scene or even shot, brilliant."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,How the system your can kill your soul. Criminal thinking at it's finest.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Just as good at the first one. Brilliant!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,As equal as the first.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Pacino is amazing in the sequal as is De Niro. Not quite as great as the first film but still extraordinary.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,best of the trilogy.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Just as good as the first one!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Amplifies and Illuminates the Original--
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Not quite as good as the original but still a very acceptable sequel, which is certainly saying something. Fredo dying still doesn't make up for Sonny's death, though, even though he probably did deserve it."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Best movie ever: Part two.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"This is one of the best, if not the best, sequels of all times - absolutely brilliant!"
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Part II of one of the most quintessential movies in the history of films!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,As good as the first.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Better than the first. That's right, I said it."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The best sequel ever made!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Simply put: the best sequel and an unbeatable crime drama. It manages the nearly-impossible feat of besting the first film and is probably amongst the best films ever crafted.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Just as good if not better than its predecessor. A bit darker, but still amazing."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,second best movie of all times
1.0,godfather_part_ii,it ll be hard for any sequel to live up to this one...
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"""Keep your friends close and your enemies closer"" - Don Michael Corleone (Al Pacino)"
1.0,godfather_part_ii,One of the best flashbacks of all time at the beginning of this marvellous sequel. Something too amazing to be done again.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,the godfather part 1 is better
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Amazing, but about .0000000000001 is how much better the first one then this one"
1.0,godfather_part_ii,my favorite godfather.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Great sequel that just adds on to the first ones greatness. De Niro was great and was very important to the story which I felt made the film more interesting. Everyone must see the Godfather 1 and 2 before they die.~ Average Movie Guy
1.0,godfather_part_ii,I think it's so much better than the original.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Robert De Niro as a young Vito Corleone!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,almost as good as the last one
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"The Godfather Part II shows as much perfection as its predecessor. Maintaining a non linear story with a strong performance from Robert De Niro and Al Pacino, The Godfather Part II is truly the greatest sequel ever made."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Al Pacino really came into his own in II. What other directors have ever won back to back best picture awards with the original and the sequel? None that I know.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Too good to describe. Just watch it!!! But watch part 1 first.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Better than the original. Robert Deniro and Al Pacino are both amazing in what probably shoud've been the last Godfather movie made.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The sequel from one of the best movies ever made. I can't say which one is better between part 1 and part 2
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"One of only 3 sequels I know of (the other two being ""Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Batman Returns"") That were actually BETTER than the original film. Absolutely excellent. May be a bit too slow-moving for viewers under 40."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"One of the greatest movies of all time, the sequel to 1972's The Godfather benefits from the incredibly talented cast, which includes superb performances from Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, and a denser, action-packed plot which fully justifies the 200-minute screen time."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Personally, it was better than it's predecessor. Pacino should have gone home with best actor. The Academy got it wrong that year. Too many scenes that will stick to you for the rest of your memory."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The benchmark for making sequels. If only they'd followed up sooner with Part III; it may have been a masterpiece.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Wow. That's all I'll say.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Two amazing stories of a father and a son in one movie. Couldn't get better than this.
0.0,godfather_part_ii,Robert Deniro's performance elevates an otherwise shitty movie
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"incredible,touching, mind blowing acting, the godfather part 2 is without question a all time classic, just like his predecessor."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,beautiful movie with beautiful backstory. one of those movies you can flip to any day and start watching and rediscovering again
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Just as good if not better than Part 1

1.0,godfather_part_ii,DVD Godfather Box Set
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Hablar de segundas partes es complicado, mas que nada porque no siempre son buenas, pero indiscutiblemente, la segunda parte del Padrino es superior y mas densa y oscura que la primera. Una obra cl√°sica que vivir√° para siempre."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Three hours and twenty minutes!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,SECOND BEST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Inclusion of De Nero is definitely a high point but the ultimate attraction remains Pacino..A great movie. One of those movies u should watch before u die.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Still debating whether or not this is better than the first.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"One or Two? One, barely."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,zo'n films kome nooit meer trg
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"La meilleure suite de tous les temps du meilleur film de tous les temps, tout simplement. Un pur chef-d'oeuvre de Francis Ford Cappola qui frappe encore dans le mille avec sa poign√©e d'acteurs talentueux. Brillant."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"One of the few sequels that ever matched its predecessor, this back-and-forth film follows Puzo's work amazingly and just strengthened a franchise that will ever live in American film lore."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Even better than the original. Amazingly directed, beautifully told, and excellently acted."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Al Pacino's acting in the film is far more superior as the ruthless don than his outsider character from the first film.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Probably my most favorite movie. Godfather II is partly based on the unused material from the first book and partly is new story by Coppola and Puzo. Needless to say GDII movie surpasses both original movie and book.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Just say three Hail Mary's and this movie is great.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,One of the best movies ever (along with Part II). Part III is so-so.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Fredo is a piece of shit.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"A perfectly constructed, supremely acted, superbly written elegy. No American movie has ever topped this masterpiece. It is not only the greatest sequel ever made, but also probably my favorite movie."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Just classic, in every way."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,A great American epic! Superior to the first!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"This is one of the greatest movies ever made. Even with the first movie being as great as it was, amazingly, Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puza were able to top themselves."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"My favourite of the serie. The cast is simply flawless. Vito corleone's story with De Niro, bullseye."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,And it is just the second one.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Maybe the best movie ever made!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"This is perhaps the greatest sequel ever made. This movie is amazingly good. I liked this one better than part 1 but I can not decide if it is better or not; either way, both movies are perfect."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,So good they had to do it again!!! The scene at the end where Pacino is sitting in the backyard is chilling!!!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,parts one and two are fantasic...part III blows.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"If Coppola had aborted this film, I would have slapped him like Pacino slapped Keaton."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The studios don't make movies like this anymore :(
1.0,godfather_part_ii,Great sequel to a great movie.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"The second obviously can't stand alone without the first or third but remains my favourite Godfather. I like the development of Michael's character at this point and enjoy the appearance of De Niro as Don Corleone, love it."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The sequel to one of the best movies ever made. And one of the best sequels ever made.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"As good as the first! I just wish they had been able to afford Marlon Brando. Oh well, Robert DeNiro is a suitable replacement."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"Pacino and De Niro, probably some of their best performances ever."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,The second chapter of the Godfather Trilogy!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,the third best drama ever made
1.0,godfather_part_ii,More Perfect than the original! taught me not to abort Michael's baby..... anyone named Michael for that matter!
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"The Godfather Part 2 is just as compelling and structurally excellent as the original, though not quite as groundbreaking."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"I consider the second part deeper then the first one. It's where we know the way Michale Corleone is, he's not a Godfather as the way his father used to be, he's just tough man."
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"De Niro and Pacino, what more do you really need to say"
1.0,godfather_part_ii,How can a sequel get better than this?
1.0,godfather_part_ii,As Good As The First One.
1.0,godfather_part_ii,"The most accomplished and well made sequel of all time. Winning 6 oscars was a great achievement, It enlarge in every circumstances from The Godfather, and Al Pacino has delivered a trend setting performance, which will always be remembered by the movie lovers."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Very witty, very smart, and funny movie. Didn't really make a huge impact on me but liked it nonetheless. Might have to re-watch it."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Great movie, Jack Benny perfect ham and Carole Lombard is always great."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"One of the top 10 comedies of all time. Jack Benny as Hamlet, directed by the great Ernst Lubitsch, one of Carole Lombard's last roles. The inspiration for Hogans Heroes. The immortal line ""What Hitler did to Poland, he did to Shakespeare!""."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"To Be or Not to Be is a relevant and layered satire, a blend of dark humor and sight gags, of comedy and morality."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Laughing at Hitler 25 years before Mel Brooks and making political suicide gags 21 years before Stanley Kubrick. I see you, Herr Lubitsch."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Laugh out loud funny when ""The Great Dictator"" or the remake struggled. Seek this one out!"
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,A comedy about totalitarian political system.
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"""To Be Or Not To Be"" was one of the greatest films made during World War II. Jack Benny and Carole Lombard were perfectly cast, however my vote goes to the greatest scene stealer of them all, Sig Rumann, in the role of ""Zo They call me Concentration Camp Erhardt?"""
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,A must-see. A film lampooning Hitler to great comedic effect in 1942. Absolutely incredible.
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Oh, I just happened by this film channel checking and what a gem! Intrigue, comedy and a most interesting plot! If this style appeals to you at all, you will thoroughly enjoy this film!"
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,One of the funniest movies I've ever seen.

1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,E' stato definito il film perfetto e probabilmente lo √®.
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,The greatest comedy ever
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"To think that a German director made this in 1942 is incredible. Ernst Lubitsch was laughing in the face of tragedy. Although serious themes are dealt with and mild peril is encountered, I was in stitches throughout. The Lubitsch Touch is in full effect."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Hilarious movie, one of the funniest films I've ever had the pleasure of watching."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,Ernst Lubitsch at his best.
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,a classic comedy unknown to many
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,Amazing blend of drama satire and comical silliness all around a tragic wartime story. Lombard was the beat female comic of the day and Jack Benny pulls of his only worthy movie role of a lifetime.
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,Lubitsch somehow finds a tone that perfectly balances comedy and gripping tension as you wonder how the characters will get out of predicament after predicament. Downright hilarious.
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"favorite line: heil myself....  ""why haven't you seen this really funny film yet?"" ....THAT is the question!"
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Otrolig gl√É¬∂d och udd med humor √É¬§r minst lika svart som ss-uniformen. Jack Bennys ""Heil myself"" som Hitler √É¬§r ju en omedelbar klassiker. Men detta √É¬§r l√É¬•ngt mycket mer √É¬§n bara en catch phrase-komedi."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,Esta comedia es m√°s moderna en su timing y su estructura que muchas de las actuales. Una verdadera genialidad.
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"A daring, and ruthlessly funny, Nazi satire."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"It's certainly one of the finest comedies ever to come out of Paramount, the allegations of dubious taste missing the point of Lubitsch's satire - not so much the general nastiness of the Nazis as their unforgiveable bad manners"
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Made at the height of World War II, this satirical comedy is a perfect vehicle for Benny."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"glorious, unlike the latest tarantino wankfest."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Hilarious, anything with Jack Benny is guaranteed to make you laugh."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Excellent comedy script. Inteligent, very authentic, flirting with other genres."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,We should all cry for living in a cinema world without Lubitsch the Prince Charming.
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,This must have pissed old Adolph off some what.A corking comedy and Benny was never better.A propoganda masterpiece....Heil Me!
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Hilarious, clever and ultimately relevant. But the directing is just incredible. The cuts, the structure, the timing and the pacing, even if the movie was awful it would be a pleasure to watch."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,Most folks know the Mel Brooks version but this is the orginal. If you HAVEN'T watched the Mel Brooks one watch this one FIRST!!! Mel is great and all but for a great old flick this is one of the best!! Comedy!! ACTION!! Nutzi's!!
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,Most folks know the Mel Brooks version but this is the orginal. If you HAVEN'T watched the Mel Brooks one watch this one FIRST!!! Mel is great and all but for a great old flick this is one of the best!! Comedy!! ACTION!! Nutzi's!!
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,A top-notch comedy from Ernst Lubitsch. Carole Lombard and Jack Benny are phenomenally funny.
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,C'est tellement dr√É¬¥le! La perle des d√É¬©couvertes de mon cours de Cin√É¬©ma du monde!
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Awesome movie, extremly funny."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"A brilliantly funny comedy from Ernst Lubitsch, portraying the oppression of the European countries under Hitler's rule while simultaneously reveling in the freedom to make fun of the Nazis to its heart's content. Wonderfully funny, greatly acted and marvelously written. Just a superb film."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"""Heil Myself."" A truly classic film. I saw it today on TCM and fell in love with it. Apparently just after filming the Japanese bombed pearl harbor. Actress Carole Lombard then became a activist selling war bonds but died in a plane crash. This was her final film."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,Undoubtedly one of the most brilliant comedy classics of all-time. Here is the master Ernst Lubitsch at his best. Carole Lombard and Jack Benny are just magnificent. Truly one of the greatest scripts in the history of cinema.
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,My favorite Lubitsch.
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"It's lovely. The best anti-war film of WWII. ""Heil myself"" is an immortal line."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,A feat of writing and comedy that hasn't been topped in the 66 years since the film was made.
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"I just discovered this movie recently, and I absolutely love it. A group of Polish actors foil a Nazi plot during WWII, but that's just the backdrop for a screwball comedy perfectly suited for Carole Lombard. Jack Benny is also great as her hammy husband."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Magistral Lubitsch. Y la escena del monologo de Hamlet, para llorar de risa hasta que se le sequen a uno los ojos. Obra Maestra."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Carole's last film, the greatest tragedy in the history of film. A hilarious screwball comedy"
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,i love you carole lombard
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"One of the great wartime comedies. Benny hams it up, and Sig Ruman is fantastic as ever in another of his idiotic villain roles. If you ejoy older films, you won't be disappointed."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"among the best lubitsch, not many do this kind of thing better than lubitsch, essential"
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"There are very few comedies which are made these days that deserve even to be mentioned in the same genre as this film, let alone the same breath! If you liked this film you will love the Mel Brooks remake just as much!"

1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"""What will Lubitch do?""... the master of all comedies."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"A masterpiece of an anti-Nazi satire comedy. Funny and intelligent. Every funny scene in this film has a clever twist. What other director has the sophisticated touch that Lubitsch has? He is truly a genius with elegant style!!! And of course, Carol Lombard is divine in this film."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,Schlicht und ergreifend genial. Keinesfalls zu verwechseln mit Mel Brooks' Remake...
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"A later Lubitsch, but not a lesser one.  Still hilarious and, one must say, rather brave, aping Hitler and Nazism right at the start of America's involvement in the war.  Plus, it stars Jack Benny. JACK BENNY. How fucking cool is that?"
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"without question, of the greatest movies of all time. the lubitsch touch is in full effect! the entire cast is simply brilliant and everyone delivers with top comedic timing especially jack benny (why didnt he act more!) and the resurgently popular carole lombard. quotable and hysterically funny."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,Just watch it. You'll understand.
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,Superby Lubitsch comedy bravely playing fast-and-loose with Hitler barely a year after Pear Harbour. A stunning achievement in which the laughs keep coming despite - or because of - how serious the jeopardy seems to be.
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"""Si vous nous piquez ne saignons-nous pas? Si vous nous chatouillez ne rions-nous pas? Si vous nous empoisonnez... Ne mourrons-nous pas? Si vous nous faite du tort, ne nous vengerons-nous pas?"" le moment le plus beau du film..."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"If Casablanca is the perfect film, ""To Be Or Not To Be"" is the perfect comedy. Dark, smart, well written, acted and directed -- I think this is Lubitsch's greatest film."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"""Shall we drink to a blitzkrieg?"" ""I prefer a slow encirclement.""  Masterful comedy, sublime drama and undoubtedly Jack Benny's finest performance; absolute clasisc."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"An American-made comedy about the occupation of Poland made a few years after the invasion that's also a hilarious verbal comedy, satire, and spy thriller at the same time."
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,"Hilariously funny, satirical, well-paced WWII comedy!"
1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,et on discute pas ...

1.0,to_be_or_not_to_be,If you want to see a movie that does everything right in the hard yards of comedy and satire -- this is Lubitsch at his finest. I love the Brooks' remake but this is better -- because it is one of the best comedies of all time.

1.0,chinatown,"Bold and brilliant. roman polanski's mistery masterpiece its an attractive,entertaining and powerful film-noir story. Great directing,script (perhaps one of the most brilliant ever on screen), strong performances and a magnificent,tour-de-force,shocking ending."
1.0,chinatown,"An exceptionally written noir that's unpredictable, funny, sharp, and uncompromisingly break. A masterwork, and one of the best films of the 70s"
1.0,chinatown,"An excellent, classic film that is suspenseful, well-filmed, and features enjoyable twists and turns. Jack Nicholson is terrific--as usual."
1.0,chinatown,A brilliant noir throwback that never let's up. Jack Nicholson is as good as he always is.
1.0,chinatown,"A very powerful film with excellent screenplay, directing, story, and top-notch performances from Dunaway and Nicholson. In my humble opinion, definitely a must-watch, even if you don't like Roman Polanski."
1.0,chinatown,Neo Noir Masterpiece.
1.0,chinatown,"This 1974 film directed by Polansky is one of the greatest expressions of the neo noir films. An excellent screenplay and a portentous performance of Jack Nicholson. Moreover, without having a happy end it makes more admirable."
1.0,chinatown,"""Chinatown"" is relentlessly pessimistic, and not just in the ending . . . its probably the definitive Neo-Noir. We should all be grateful Polanski forcibly altered the finale to what it is now because anything else would be unacceptable."
1.0,chinatown,"A film that gets better with every viewing, and showcases the talents of everybody involved."
1.0,chinatown,"One of the darkest, most stylish films ever made. May be a bit slow for casual viewers but there is a lot of special in this strange cocktail of decadence and grit."
1.0,chinatown,"Thanks to its twisting plot and surprise ending, ""Chinatown"" is probably the best noir to be made after the noir era."
1.0,chinatown,"Incredible film, Nicholson at his very best."
1.0,chinatown,A masterpiece of noir cinema.
1.0,chinatown,"Fantastic performances from both Nicholson & Dunaway, an absolute classic."
1.0,chinatown,Great noir. Must see. Jack at his best.
1.0,chinatown,"Jack Nicholson plays arguably his best role (yes, better than The Shining) and Roman Polanski directs a near perfect masterpiece of a film that borrows from Hitchcock and other noir aficionados."
1.0,chinatown,One of the most entertaining films of all time. The film super glues you to the screen and once the film ends you'll be yearning for side stories from the brutally shady & unpredictable chinatown of the 1930's. You'll also wish there were a JJ Gittes comic book/animated series. So good.
1.0,chinatown,"Well, Roman Polanski is probably my favorite director. This is a movie is unlike any of his other works. This really is a masterpiece, like most of his films before this one. I guess that's Roman Polanski for you."
1.0,chinatown,"Masterpiece, as I'm sure you all know."
1.0,chinatown,"In spite of what Gene Siskel says, the production design and the composition of the frames are by no means contrived. Instead we have a film that is tremendous from start to finish striking a perfect balance between noir homages and originality."
1.0,chinatown,A masterpiece on every level. A must-see classic.

1.0,chinatown,"Uma das obras m√°ximas de Polanski, com roteiro genial de Robert Towne, atua√ß√µes maravilhosas de Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway e John Houston, al√©m da trilha sonora sombria no tom certo do mestre Jerry Goldsmith."
1.0,chinatown,"Despite his personal faults, one thing is for sure about Roman Polanski- he sure knows how to make a damn good noir film."
1.0,chinatown,What a great movie. I can't believe I've lived in LA for 20 years and am now just seeing it. Such a great looking film.
1.0,chinatown,"A tribute to film noir in color. A great caper with multiple mysteries to solve. Endlessly copied. Eccentric performances from the three leads will keep your attention. The ending feels abrupt and unsatisfying every time I watch it, but I guess that's the point, the tragedy of it."
1.0,chinatown,"Flawless, classic Noir film. Bleak, tragic, and amazing."

1.0,chinatown,Just about as good as a movie gets. Excellent from top to bottom
1.0,chinatown,"Jack Nicholson, often known for going over the top (The Shining, Batman) gives a very controlled and low-key performance in this deliberately-paced neo noir film under the masterful direction of Roman Polanski. Anyone who likes film noir needs to see this film."
1.0,chinatown,"In the another universe, Chinatown and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest won around 10 academy awards. One of the awards are Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress and Screenplay."
1.0,chinatown,Love this movie. It starts off strange and just gets weirder and weirder without getting distracted from the main plotline. Some of Nicholson's best work (before he got typecast in the 80s) and definitely Polanski's masterpiece.

1.0,chinatown,"It hooks you from start to finish without an ounce of boredom in between. I loved this film so much, I won't even hesitate to say that it should have won Best Picture in 1974. I consider this to be Polanski's greatest film to date, and one of the all time greatest movies."

1.0,chinatown,"Polanski's best, or at least strongest. The use of Nicholson, Dunaway and Huston is immense, the cinematic scope is awesome and Towne's screenplay is a monolith of the form."
1.0,chinatown,One of the most perfect private eye movies ever. Nicholson was at the top of his game and also one of the bleakest endings to a movie ever. Filled with humour and great dialogue.
1.0,chinatown,Brilliant 30's-era noir.
1.0,chinatown,"I've been wanting to see this one for awhile, and it sure didn't disappoint. The slick, private-eye atmosphere of the 30s and 40s is conveyed perfectly, the music is phenomenal, and the storytelling is wonderful. Nicholson's performance shines."
1.0,chinatown,Decided to watch this after playing L.A Noire. The movie is amazing. Jack is at his best here and Roman Polanski's touch rocks. I need to see the sequel. The camerawork towards the end finally shifting to the villain was an awesome touch.True Noir film.
1.0,chinatown,One of my all time favorites...
1.0,chinatown,Roman Polanski's masterpiece!
1.0,chinatown,"Chinatown is a smart, well written and well acted film by Roman Polanski. Jack Nicholson is great as the main character, and Polanki's direction is excellent."
1.0,chinatown,"In the genre of film noir, nothing surpasses it. Roman Polanski's best film. One of the greatest in the history of cinema. Robert Towne's screenplay is hands down the greatest ever written in the history of film. One of the best of the 70's."
1.0,chinatown,A truly brilliant film.
1.0,chinatown,um dos meus filmes favoritos :)

1.0,chinatown,The cinematography is stunningly brilliant. As is the rest of the film
1.0,chinatown,Quite possibly the best film ever made - you'll never find a tighter screenplay or better performances. And Polanki's direction - wow.
1.0,chinatown,"The classic noir masterpiece that while being both the greatest crime drama, and private eye film ever made, is a true landmark in cinema history. With absolutely no flaws, and the brilliant writing, acting, and directing put into it, there is nothing to dislike about this detective classic."

1.0,chinatown,"One of the only films I know of that is legitimately great on every single level, from its writing to its directing to its acting to its cinematography. I honestly have nothing bad to say about it. Very smart and very entertaining. If you haven't seen it yet, fix that as soon as possible."
0.0,chinatown,Really boring Roman Polanski film from 1974 starring Jack Nicholson as a private investigator. I gave up after 45 minutes.

1.0,star_trek_11,"Can't compare a 2hr movie to a 3 season / 80 episode series + all its morality. Nevertheless it is still Star Trek in all sense. Grateful to see some of Star Trek best OG characters again, may they live on forever."
1.0,star_trek_11,Awesome reboot. Must watch for sci-fi fans.
1.0,star_trek_11,One of the rare reboots that many can say as superior to its source. Abrams took it upon himself to direct a talented cast and lead the iconic Star Trek label to new heights.
1.0,star_trek_11,"The actors all NAILED their character. I couldn't have been more happy with the movie. Saw it with a few (stupid) people that think star trek is lame, etc, and they were all big fans of the movie."
1.0,star_trek_11,You can say anything you want about J.J. but he saved Star Trek.
0.0,star_trek_11,Absolute crap. Complete dreck. Generic action sci-fi with the Star Trek name slapped on it. An entire franchise raped to death by Jar Jar Abrams.

1.0,star_trek_11,Abrams did a great service to the franchise when he rebooted Star Trek. The re-imaging of the design of the U.S.S. Enterprise gave the iconic starship a brand new look while paying homage to the classic design. Fun yet cerebral.

1.0,star_trek_11,"Perfect movie. Original, exhilarating and splendidly entertaining while also being everything Star Trek should be and a little better. Gets a bit confusing with the multiple Spock thing, but makes more sense after a rewatch. Doesn't feel like it's getting old."

0.0,star_trek_11,"A very poor restart of the star trek universe, whoever thought ditching FIFTY YEARS of star trek history for this should have been fired."
0.0,star_trek_11,One of the single worst movies ever made. It is completely ruthless and thoughtless to its source material. If you like this movie your not really a Star Trek fan. This movie is terrible and only exists so that JJ Abrams could prove himself worthy of Star Wars 7 which was ok
1.0,star_trek_11,"Destiny in a foreign time and space that forges a unlikely group of fleet to band together. Why we greatly need a leader and those behing them. calculation and spontaneous decision making. Destiny we choose to follow, we understand it comes with some sacrifice."

1.0,star_trek_11,Brilliant! Never really watched Star Trek but this was awesome! :D
1.0,star_trek_11,As a fan of the traditional Star Trek I was slightly hesitant to watch this 'reboot' once I accepted this as a separate entity to the other stuff I actually really enjoyed this film and look forward to the development of the crew and ship.
1.0,star_trek_11,that is illogical. LOL!
1.0,star_trek_11,"Great fun, touching story and what a ride!"

1.0,star_trek_11,It broadens the franchise to make anyone like the sci-fi adventures of the USS Enterprise. Zachary Quinto makes an oddly amazing performance following his career in the doomed series Heroes.
0.0,star_trek_11,JJ Abrahms does Star Trek for teens with no comprehension of science.
1.0,star_trek_11,the movie that made me a star trek fan and a well developed story to a film
1.0,star_trek_11,Great movie! Everybody will love it.
1.0,star_trek_11,Love love loved it. So happy Star Trek was brought into the main stream. Every scene develops the plot and has some kind of action in it.
1.0,star_trek_11,"I really loved this remake one of the best I've seen, it captured the essence of the original and bought some think new to the franchise."
1.0,star_trek_11,"Apart from Wrath of Khan, it's easily one of the best of the Star Trek 12 films. Refreshing update of the ageing saga. However, the standard by this film is set too high for the next star trek (12th) to top."
1.0,star_trek_11,wasn't an original trek fan so I like that they start at the beginning. one of my favorite movie experiences
1.0,star_trek_11,Not disappointed. I am thrilled with this movie and can not wait for the movies that follow this one. J.J Abrams is outstanding and the actors were casted perfectly.

1.0,star_trek_11,"I was never a Star Trek fan, being more of a Star Wars. This movie changed that, making me visit the original series and next generation, tuning me into a full-fledged Trekkie. Live long and prosper."
1.0,star_trek_11,Great reboot into an alternative universe. String Theory anyone?
1.0,star_trek_11,"The New Star Trek is a dream come true, enough nostalgia to satisfy the fans and refreshing enough to draw in newcomers, and It's all thanks to fast-paced action, an engaging story, and some outstanding acting performances"

1.0,star_trek_11,The first in the rebooted series does not disappoint. The plot is excellent and the casting was spot on.
1.0,star_trek_11,Okay I've seen the original series and the original movies so I was a skeptic watching the reboot. However they proved me wrong. They successfully twisted the plot and leave you on the edge of your seat through the whole movie. I love it!
1.0,star_trek_11,loved this reboot of the original series. great Como of SciFi and action
0.0,star_trek_11,This was one dull ride.. ironic for a film that has nothing but action... very little story or characters. just mindless action and a whole lot of lens flair
1.0,star_trek_11,thoroughly enjoyable they hit a homerun with this one
1.0,star_trek_11,Its breathtaking and a fresh look of how it all began from beginning to end with amazing effects and brilliant characters.

1.0,star_trek_11,excellent reset! I hope we get a TV series based on this new Star Trek universe!
1.0,star_trek_11,Perfect for what it was. A much needed reboot for a great franchise that ended on such a low note. Lens flares everywhere!
0.0,star_trek_11,"Hmmm... Where do I start with this? Slow, boring and predictable. I literally fell asleep when it got up to an hour. Very disappointing. And as for the sequel, no thanks. I'll take a pass."

1.0,star_trek_11,best film of the year simply spectacular
1.0,star_trek_11,Just simply fantastic. Abrams is a genius. The character development is just seamless. The way the movie starts sucks you in for the entire movie and makes you want more and more. Talk about an attention getter.
1.0,star_trek_11,Wonderful front story on how all the characters came to meet and evolve. Great action sequences and special effects.
1.0,star_trek_11,re-inventing that adds without taking away from the star trek lore
1.0,star_trek_11,one of the best sci-fi films i have ever seen
1.0,star_trek_11,You either love or hate the new ones. I am a huge fan of Gene Rodenberry's original and The Next Generation series. I really enjoyed this installment and thought they selected the cast well.
1.0,star_trek_11,I really like the direction J.J. Abrams took with this - opens it up to a lot of new adventures.
1.0,star_trek_11,Ever seen a black hole swallow an entire planet starting from the core outward? Well this is probably the closest you'll ever get to that. Harold is in it with a high tech katana that folds and unfolds. Flawless special effects and orgasmic action. Need I say more?
1.0,star_trek_11,"This new, younger, and action packed version of the franchise shows what you can do with a strong story, a young and new cast, and even better than Star Wars prequel special effects."
1.0,star_trek_11,"Not a Star Trek fan, but this movie felt so accessible and entertaining, I enjoyed it very much and will have to keep an eye out for sequels."

1.0,star_trek_11,"Maintaining the charm of the classic series while still reinventing it for a new generation, Star Trek is a brilliant example of smart, popcorn entertainment."
1.0,star_trek_11,"Great reinvention of the Star Trek Universe, Gene would be proud!"
1.0,star_trek_11,Great film!! One of the best of the year!! Makes Star Trek exciting!!
1.0,star_trek_11,The best film of 2009 in my opinion. This revamp made Star Trek more mainstream allowing all to enjoy this amazing world.
0.0,star_trek_11,"The worst hack and slash ever done to a noble franchise. Please, fire these writers. This was clearly written by men who hate Star Trek fans."
1.0,star_trek_11,"I don't think there is a single boring moment in Star Trek (2009). It's a consistently entertaining film that never stops to breath, which is okay considering the fact that the film has a free flowing & breezy vibe. One of the best action/adventure films of the 2000's, hands down. It's great fun."
1.0,star_trek_11,"An incredible production to put a fresh twist to the well-known franchise. Well acted, scripted, directed, and visually stunning. A must-see for Star Trek fans and those skeptical alike."

1.0,star_trek_11,"Se sai bem em tudo... Do √≥timo enredo e personagens bem constru√≠dos, passando por efeitos especiais fant√°sticos at√© o esp√≠rito original da saga. J.J. Abrams merece aplausos por dar nova vida √° s√©rie com louvor."
1.0,star_trek_11,just because it's Zachary Quinto...
1.0,star_trek_11,"Liked this in spite of myself! Always hated Star Trek growing up, and after the Vegas Hilton fiasco...let's just say I'm not a fan. LOL But this caught me completdly off-guard and made a fan of me. Kudos!!"
1.0,star_trek_11,J.J Abrams reboots the star trek franchise beautifully.
1.0,star_trek_11,An action packed and visually stunning re-imagining of the classic franchise.
1.0,star_trek_11,Was pretty good!!! ^_^
1.0,star_trek_11,"A great prequel, with lots of action and background to some of the characters. Fantastic how the leads capture the same behaviour as the original actors. A must."
1.0,star_trek_11,hands down my favorite movie of all time. only closely followed by its sequel
1.0,star_trek_11,"Not only a sort of reboot but also a sequel of the previous movies, this is without a doubt a welcomed return and a perfect way to introduce new fans without losing the old Trekkies, filled with nostalgia, very well driven characters and well orchestrated action."
1.0,star_trek_11,Amazing. Freaking awesome.
1.0,star_trek_11,Fell in love with going to movies all ovet again thanks to this film. it was a real treat to see on the big screen.
1.0,star_trek_11,"Great movie, extremely funny and action packed, Chris Pine (as James Kirk) & Karl Urban (as Leonard ""Bones"" McCoy) really did such an amazing job... highly recommended!!!"
1.0,star_trek_11,Great adaption from old tv series
1.0,la_grande_illusion,my favorite film ever
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"The best foreign film I've watched, thus far. Its so good that writing a review would take too much time, but let me just say this: This is a film EVERY person should watch and a film that will still be important a CENTURY from now."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Erich von Stroheim was as always superb in this movie. Thank you Jean Renoir for this beautiful film with such a great message.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the most crucial and humanist of films.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Simple yet emotionally complex. An anti-war story about patriotism, war, brotherhood and humanity. La Grande Illusion served as an influence to many future filmmakers dealing with the topic of war. Sad, funny and moving all at once!"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the best movies of all time. I've never had such a strong urge to watch a movie a second time right after seeing it.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A terrific masterpiece that should be known and watched by everyone. Its important anti-war message, along with powerful topics such as friendship and humanity, makes this film an essential viewing experience. A masterful classic that will continue to be admired and studied in years to come."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Greatest Foreign Language anti-war movie, aside from being a great movie on its own terms. Admirable restoration!"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Like All Quiet on the Western Front, this film is still one of the best war films ever made."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"One of the few films that rank among the best of any art form. Shocking and brave for it's time, the progressive ideology of the film is more progressive than most films out today."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"An incredible film, with such a brilliant message and such a well thought out manner of portraying it that it deserves its place as one of the greatest films ever made."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Classic perfect film. Old film that is entertaining enough for modern filmgoers to enjoy throughly. For those who may want to watch the film more studiously pay attention to how the film deals with its major themes (race, class, war)."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"An arrestingly humanistic, anti-war masterwork, in part thanks to the camera's light and calm motion."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,It's a beautiful film. Not just for the way it looks but what it says & how it moves.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,There's a reason this is always listed among the best film's ever made. It is. The restoration brings Renoir's perfect cinematography to new clarity. Von Stroheim's performance is quietly elegant. You cannot call yourself a film fan until you see this.

1.0,la_grande_illusion,"simple story with characters both subtle and heartfelt, it's timeless, moving, and easy to love."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,A classic that moves one on many levels. See it if it's playing nearby.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Jean Renoir aims high with this film. Renoir exceeds this and he doesn't miss a beat. After you watch this film, you feel so emotionally drained. Outstanding achievement in telling the story and cinematography. Just as political as it is emotional. My personal 2nd favorite film ever."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Brilliant film. Nuff said
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Admit it: you wish you could be as cool as Jean Gabin.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,The 75th Anniversary restoration is absolutely beautiful. Grand Illusion is a powerful and unforgettable film.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,My first (movie) Criterion that I purchased. How can a guy forget his first?
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Le monde change devant nos yeux. Film absolument superbe!
1.0,la_grande_illusion,[i]Review coming soon.[/i]
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Probably the most fun I've ever had with an anti-war film. Renoir's film is rich in flair, thematic material and humor, and earns every right to be considered one of the most important films of all time. Casa Blanca, took more than a few cues from this."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Perhaps not Renoir's most radical film, but in my opinion his most moving, about the dislocations created by war and the at times futile struggles of men to stay somehow connected--to friends, to social classes, to lost conventions."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Oh sweet Jesus, so much deep focus. Such a good story. Such great directing. Sublime acting. I LOVE IT!"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Sublime, serene, and elegiac. I watch this once a year and that may not be enough. I'm not sure what's more sad: the horrors of war, or trying to place a gentleman's agreement on top of the whole mess. A true 10-star masterpiece."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Great Jean Renoir war film about officers and the death of the nobility in World War 1. Renoir is one of the best directors of all time, and this is one of his best movies."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Experi√É¬™ncia cinematografica cinco estrelas. Um filme que quase desapareceu da hist√É¬≥ria do cinema mundial.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A beautiful, subtle, humane, enormously influential look at war, the people who fight on both sides, and a system of the world that was inexorably on its way out, for better and for worse."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Renoir is easily one of the greatest directors of all time
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Jean Renoirs La Grande Illusion er intet mindre enn ett tidl√É¬∏st mesterverk! Jean Gabin, Pierre Fresnay og Erich Von Stroheim spiller hovedrollene i dette episke verket om vennskap og aristokrati. En klassiker!"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Grand Illusion is a timeless peace of cinema forever ensured to be remembered generation by generation. It`s just a remarkable film you have to experience for yourself.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"I love that the original P.O.W film is the one that manages to break the stereotypes, the WW1 setting also adds an extra dimension awesome"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,c juste trop grandiose!!!
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A magnificent film which questions the very nature of our social and ethnic divisions. Offers in the grimmest of contexts, when all the divisive prejudices have sunk along with all prior notions of civilization, the possibility for a new model of pacifism, humanism and egalitarianism to emerge."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Very exciting and extremely ingenious
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"It's a curious film. The title is purposely misleading. The ""illusion"" doesn't have to do with escaping from any POW camp."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A very layered, and thoughtful work. Fantastic use of a disjointed 3-act structure. I think I prefer to The Rules of the Game. 9.5/10"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Never have I seen an Anti-War film so impressionable; one of the deepest, most critical films of its century."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,one of the 10 greatest films I have ever seen...
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A intelligent and subtle way of expressing the fear of war through the people effected by it. Some directors today still feel righteous to show heroism during war, where in fact Renoir's anti war message is considerably more apt."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Renoir is the bomb. A prison camp film from WWI with a unique perspective. Finely acted and thought provoking.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,There are some minor flaws but mostly this is incredible. Good on him for making it right before WWII. It's shocking how much The Great Escape steals from this movie.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"My favorite Renoir, and starring the great Jean Gabin and Erich von Stroheim"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,A fantastic war film that has had a clear influence on nearly every other escape movie since.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Fantastic film from Renoir! I was shocked and a bit moved by the scene where the prisoners of war find pleasure in looking at women's clothing. Just one of many scenes that make this a rare and unbeatable war film.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"There are so many good things about this movie. The cast is perfect for a start. The guts Renoir showed in making it. The arc of the story. The triumph and tragedy of it's characters. And Erich Von Stroheim, what a guy!"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,The best french movie ever made?
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"The first ""P.O.W. Escape"" movie, and by far the best"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the best films ever.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Truly powerful, poignant, and moving."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"der film hat mir sehr gefallen, will mehr filme von renoir sehen. erich von stroheim ist ja auch in sunset bv."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,It's amazing how real this movie feels.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,I had forgotten how flabbergastingly great this thing is. Just astonishing. Renoir's introduction is a must.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,I saw this in my TFM class and it's one of the oldies but goodies. Really romance driven.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A beautifully optimistic tribute to human nature in the face of the tragic idiocy (or ""grand illusion"") of nationalism, class, ""duty"", politics and everything else that divides us."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,An amazing film with some very amusing moments. A classic must-see Jean Renoir film!
1.0,la_grande_illusion,a testament to humanity in the midst of war
0.0,la_grande_illusion,"When you really sit down and talk about it, World War is silly, don't you think? I mean, instead of fighting we could, I don't know, be drinking wine or eating cheese . . ."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"The most unique WWI film I have seen. No attempt to show the trenches, but the relationships of people. I enjoyed, hmm-mmm."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"I hadn't seen this in years! This is a newly restored version, and it's poetry. Lots of movies demonstrate that war is hell, but this is a rare movie that says that war can bring out the best in an individual."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the greatest films ever made!
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Nice little ""surviving adversity"" film with a sorta/kinda happy ending. Oh, wait...what's this subplot about class? Or antisemitism? Or relationships transcending politics/class/language? WTF! Why is all this serious stuff in my entertainment?"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"If this isn't the greatest movie ever made, it's certainly in the top 20. There is layer upon layer of subtext and social commentary in this film, on top of a pretty gripping story. It's much more than a POW film, and it's worth seeing at least once in a lifetime."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,A great anti war film. GW would ban it if he could...
1.0,la_grande_illusion,the great classic. everyone should have seen it
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the best movies of all time!
1.0,la_grande_illusion,You've heard of this for a reason. It's one of the best films ever made. It's silly to say anything more. But it certainly holds up more than well.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A very nice, fun film. It deals with everything from war to class to race in a prison camp environment. A classic brilliant film."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Consistently number one or two on my list of greatest films of all time. Pure cinematic poetry. Unforgettable.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"An amazing, deeper-than-expected film by Jean Renoir. It's a complex look at war, and the fracturing and bringing together that it is capable of. Humor is wisely weaved in, and with a superb cast, this film tackles the war with whole-hearted conviction."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A beautiful film in many ways. Renoir's constantly moving camera provides the film with a wonderful kineticism. I was surprised at how funny the film was, which works in its favor and makes its anti-war message that much more poignant."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"My favorite movie of all time. Probably one of the earlier anti-war films, it takes place, mostly, in a prisoner-of-war camp during WWI, and depicts the class struggle on both sides of the conflict."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Most nuanced war movie I've ever seen. Incredible.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,un chef d'oeuvre : humour a la Audiard avant Audiard et humanit√© en temps de guerre. magnifique
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"If we through Bogart and Gable in this bad boy we have the Beatles of early sound film. This all star cast and amazing director combine powers to create a film that has stood the test of time for over 70 years. Erich von Stroheim is the coolest sad, old man in the history of cinema... maybe."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,The 86% of people 'not interested' in seeing this film should be ashamed.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Something that great films have in common is that they stretch across more than 3 acts. There is a reason why most critics include this film in their 'top 5' list of greatest films.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the greatest war movies ever.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"fabulous. lots of later 50s war films (great escape, colditz story) are copies of this. class, ethics, camaraderie, friendship, love. in the usual, surprisingly 'modern' style of all Renoir's films and the French 'c'est la vie' realistic attitude. I BLOODY LOVE RENOIR FILMS"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,One of the best movies ever made
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Probably the best war movie ever. Steve McQueen's ""Great ""Escape"" was a dumbed-down version of this film. There are class struggles, castle escapes, WWI tearing apart Europe, solitary."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Absolument merveilleux sur le plan humain.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A movie for all time about man-made caste systems, ethnic and country divisions. Questions the true nature of honor."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Powerful movie... one of the 3 best films I've ever seen (with Citizen Kane and The Godfather Pt. II). Gabin is incredible! I used to have the Criterion Collection DVD of this film; sadly, I sold it a couple of years ago."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Hitler called it Cinematic public enemy number one. Amazing stuff, heavily borrowed by Casablanca but a richer film that is the true father of all anti-war movies"
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A magnificent film which questions the very nature of our social and ethnic divisions. Offers in the grimmest of contexts, when all the divisive prejudices have sunk along with all prior notions of civilization, the possibility for a new model of pacifism, humanism and egalitarianism to emerge."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,AWESOME! I loved it. I think Professor Dine-Young for having film class watch it because sadly I would have never picked it up on my own.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,the passing of the old guard
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A war film where only 1 shot is fired. This, Paths Of Glory & The Deer Hunter are the finest films about the absurdity & horror of war --if you ask me."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"A grand masterpiece with a great trio of actors, Jean Gabin, Fresnay and Stroheim. A must see anti-war movie."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Ultimately through the visuals of the endless, snowcovered, Swiss Alps Renoir teaches the viewer that the borders humans create are not recognized by nature, but rather just a grand illusion."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"""Frontiers are an invention of men. Nature doesn't give a hoot."""
1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Le film pacifiste par excellence. Il raconte la fin d'un monde, prophetise les horreurs de la deuxieme guerre mondiale qui s'annoncait a l'epoque, tout en affirmant l'humanite de tous les etres humains, sans exception. Les pseudo-pacificistes de notre epoque devraient en prendre de la graine..."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,To all you people who spend your afternoons writing long reviews of various Jennifer Lopez romantic comedies: You goddamn peasants wouldn't good cinema if it shot you in the face.

1.0,la_grande_illusion,"Probably my favorite film by Jean Renoir - and that's saying something! A sophisticated reflection on class and civility during the Great War. Featuring some of the finest acting the camera ever captured, Renoir's Grand Illusion stands deservedly as one of the cinema's all time greats."
1.0,la_grande_illusion,Certainly my favourite film. I prefer it to Rules of the Game. A most beautiful and humane film.
1.0,la_grande_illusion,An unmatched look at the farce of war and a clear proof that you don't need any bulletholes to make a war classic.

1.0,400_blows,"Truffaut's debut film is a masterpiece of thoughtful visual storytelling, a beautiful synthesis of art and realism.

1.0,400_blows,Very classic French film. Message is deep.
1.0,400_blows,"Probably the best performance by a kid i've seen in a movie. Leaud is so good, he shows the character's confusion and angst so well. And Truffaut makes the character believable and easy to relate to. The last shot is something that will stay with you and haunt your dreams."
1.0,400_blows,"A truly revolutionary film in its day , this movie turned moviemaking on its head. The first of the Doinel cycle. Rich and textured, JP L√É (C)aud gives a wonderful performance, really unbelievable for a teenage newcomer."

1.0,400_blows,"You would all be crazy missing out on this movie about a young boy's sadness and detachment which is caused by his parents in Paris. This turns him to a life of crime but we still surprisingly root for his cause of wanting to be free. It is almost like ""The Catcher in the Rye""."

1.0,400_blows,"One of the most ""Ahead-of-It's-Time"" films I've ever seen. Astonishing to watch considering what was being played in America at the time and proof that the French basically invented modern filmmaking during their New Wave period."
1.0,400_blows,A masterpiece in storytelling
1.0,400_blows,"Absolutely love Truffaut. Just made the best coming of age story. Tortured at home, can't make it on the streets, screwed over by friends, not to mention going to a Boy's Only Reform Camp. Just what 1959 was all about. Loved every second."

1.0,400_blows,I really love the few French New Wave films I've watched because they've got the quality of art from the 1920s-30's - it's fresh and iconoclastic -- driven by the pretension of youth. Les 400 Coups is to the New Wave as The Fountain is to Dada.

1.0,400_blows,A truly great first feature from Truffaut. Lots of truth in it...poignancy...heart. Don't let subtitles or b/w keep you from seeing this movie!
1.0,400_blows,"What do you say about a favourite? 'The 400 Blows' makes me want to run through the streets of Paris, and escape to the seaside. I too was young once."
1.0,400_blows,One of the greatest ending scenes of any film. Antoine Doinel is one of the best protagonists of all time. A must-see.

1.0,400_blows,A magnificent movie by Francois Truffaut.
1.0,400_blows,"One of the very few PERFECT films ever made. Just like Forbidden Games, this film concerns the death of innocence, but The 400 Blows is the seminal film on the subject. One of the top 10 greatest films ever made."
1.0,400_blows,classic piece of french cinema from francois truffaut.
1.0,400_blows,"I don't think Truffaut ever surpassed this one. He came close, but for me the lingering, nostalgic naturalism and sense of childhood's finite nature make this one impossible not to love on a very simple level."

1.0,400_blows,Beautiful cinematography and a well made feeling of depression and misunderstanding in this film.

0.0,400_blows,"Ok, it's considered as the origin of the ""Nouvelle Vague"", the main character is Truffault's alter-ego and it was made in the fifties. Although it seemed pointless to me."

1.0,400_blows,"Superb acting to complement a powerful story. The film makes a clear suggestion that messed up adults create messed up kids. On the flip side, kids can be quite resilient in trying to find ways to survive the mixed messages of the adult world around them."
1.0,400_blows,The only film from the French New Wave I can re-watch. This film affected me the way Catcher in the Rye did for many other folks.
1.0,400_blows,The film that woke me up to cinema when I was a teenage.Thanks PBS!
1.0,400_blows,This is a timeless classic - a beautiful beautiful story of a mischievous young boy deserted by the world (save perhaps his lone friend) who looks for an escape and finds none - the tracking shot followed by the sea and that freeze... unbelievable.

1.0,400_blows,The final scene on the beach is one of the most hearthrobbing and hopeful little piece of art in the whole history of cinema.
1.0,400_blows,"I'm going to avoid name dropping things like ""French new wave"" and such and describe the film as some said it to me.""It's like Degrassi Junior High if Degrassi Junior High was awesome and French and had better music.""I'm inclined to agree."
1.0,400_blows,"La historia es hermosa, la fotorafia de la pelicula igual, me encanta... el final es fasinante... Tru ffaut un gran maestro...!!!!"

1.0,room_2015,Really amazingly powerful film. Superb performances all round. A film that stays with you long after it's over. Highly recommended.
0.0,room_2015,Ok but boring towards the end
1.0,room_2015,Pretty damn good. Not much bad to say....
1.0,room_2015,"Chilling to the bone, emotional and ultimately everything you want in a thriller."
1.0,room_2015,I felt every fiber of emotion. Superb acting all around!
1.0,room_2015,"This was a tough movie to watch in one sitting because of the strong emotions involved. Jacob Tremblay who played the child, has done an outstanding job at conveying the strangeness of suddenly experiencing freedom after being born into, and living a life of, captivity for 5 years."
1.0,room_2015,Brilliant. Think this is another case where the movie was better than the book (the horror!). Acting was incredible- cried multiple times.
1.0,room_2015,"One of the best movies I have ever seen, along with Larson's other stellar film ""Short Term 12."" Was left enchanted and filled with hope despite the sobering storyline."
1.0,room_2015,Fine movie. Maybe a bit overrated.

0.0,room_2015,Painfully boring. Uninteresting from start to finish. Great idea squandered by terrible story telling.
1.0,room_2015,This movie deserves all the hype.
1.0,room_2015,"Despite the grim premise, Room is ultimately not a film about captivity or abuse - don't be put off by these elements. This is a really extraordinary story about the love between a mother and son and the capacity of a child's imagination. Moving and uplifting."
1.0,room_2015,"Wow! What a great movie, it's moving.That little boy in the movie is a rising star. Bre did a Fabulous job of conveying a mothers love.A must see movie! Probably the best of the year."
1.0,room_2015,"I loved this movie so much. It made me cry like a little bitch, and I was terrified for them, and I was sad for them, and happy for them, and the whole thing is just one million emotions."
1.0,room_2015,one of the most powerful movies I have seen period
1.0,room_2015,one for the history book...probably the best movie from 2015...
1.0,room_2015,It transports you into a story. And you experience it both from the Child's and Mother's perspective. I was blown away. There's so much more to say but I'll stop and reflect later!

1.0,room_2015,"A great captivating film that has one of the best child performances of all time. The acting is phenomenal, and the film itself has a great twist by letting you focus on the youngest character rather than the wisest character. Beautiful and smart. A Must-Watch."
1.0,room_2015,I don't know what to say the film is great and I enjoyed it well done I don't know how a nine year old was able to understand the role of the character and even Brie was great loved her work in the film. The cast was great and the film worked.

1.0,room_2015,I really hate this movie. I hate it because it was so good yet almost unbearably devastating. Jacob Tremblay is frighteningly convincing.
1.0,room_2015,"Riveting, heartfelt, unique and compelling drama. The performances make this story feel as if it were true."
1.0,room_2015,"Brie Larson is astonishing and fully deserves that Oscar but Jacob Tremblay steals the film, and what an emotional, outstandingly acted and wonderfully structured film it is. Honest, inspiring and human."
0.0,room_2015,Not as good as THE Room (2003)
1.0,room_2015,Never underestimate the will of the human spirit. As well as a mothers love for her child.

0.0,room_2015,If I never ever have to see this movie again it will be WAY to soon. Ughhhhh -1

1.0,room_2015,"The two lead actors make this world feel so real, it's haunting."
1.0,room_2015,"This film never compromised with telling it's tale. It was a painful, untidy, sometimes contradictory picture. It sensitively depicted mother and child creating a world adapted to but never defeated by the big bad wolf who regularly visited to cause hurt. A hurt that would stay with them forever."
1.0,room_2015,Shocking but awesome movie. Wow!
1.0,room_2015,Great movie with authentic actress. After I watched this movie I reminded myself about quote from 127 Hours movie: There is no force more powerful than will to live.

1.0,room_2015,just got punched in the heart
1.0,room_2015,Wonderful and beautiful film that reminds me of how magical and joyful life can be--balanced by painful episodes which allows us to view life with perspective. See this film if you have not!
1.0,room_2015,Room is led by amazing performances from Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay that gives us a mesmerizing look into the psychological and emotional stress from a traumatic event.
1.0,room_2015,This is one of the best dramas I've seen all year! I highly recommend it. It was very close to the book too. See it if possible!

1.0,room_2015,Heart wrenching and heart warming. Spectacular performances.
1.0,room_2015,Shame that Academy doesn't have kids category. Room is Jacob Tremblay's game and he played it well with his acting skills. Lenny Abrahamson mastered the indie-film craft.

1.0,room_2015,Jacob Tremblay and Brie Larson are the perfect team when it comes to this film. The story line was great. The director was able to show this story that could have gone down a completely dark path but was able to show us some hope in every situation. Definitely one of my favorites.
1.0,room_2015,What a great and emotional movie. Brie Larson definitely deserved the Best Actress and Jacob Tremblay was deserving of at the very least supporting actor or some recognition. Get your tissues ready :'(
1.0,room_2015,"Amazing! Heartbreaking & heartwarming at the same time. If you haven't watched this yet, DO IT! You will not regret it"
1.0,room_2015,Great movie with incredible performances but it will likely haunt you...I saw it about a month ago and I still think of it whenever I see a little boy...the combination of child and sexual abuse (done in such a realistic way) may be too much for some to handle.
1.0,room_2015,Amazing movie with amazing actors.
1.0,room_2015,"Fantastic movie. Stuningly acted by both Brie Larsen and Jacob Tremblay. You'll think often about the impact tis film has on you for several days. Frightening and tender, these two actors make for an unforgettable viewing experience."

1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,So goddamn entertaining and awesome.
1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,"Classic film starring Bette Davis as a famous but aging actress who finds herself slowly eclipsed by a young upstart played by Anne Baxter. Excellent from beginning to end, this is some of the finest writing & acting you'll ever catch in film."
1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,One of the first movies I really loved as a kid. It made me wish that the grown ups I knew talked this way. The dialog is amazing.

1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,"Wow! Current-day Hollywood is not capable of creating such a gem! The subtlety on multiple levels, as well as Davis' willingness to be shown as a 40-year-old actress, and thus with wrinkles and flaws are hallmarks of the Golden Age. Anne Baxter is also a worthy foe."
1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,this Best Picture winner is perhaps the greatest film about showbiz. Bette Davis gives her best performance here and Celeste Holm and Thelma Ritter are also fascinating here. The witty script strikes the audience at any viewing and it is shot well and directed distinctly

1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,Anne Baxter and Bette Davis deliver 2 legendary performances in this timeless classic!
1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,"Great performances. And remains certain questions for the identity of the human being: who is Eve? Who is Margot? Who are actually the people, by which they are imitated?"
1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,"Bette Davis is maybe the best reason for anyone to watch it, as well as the the excellent work by Manciewicz (co-writter of the script for Welles's ""Citizen Kane"")."
1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,was 1950 the year of satirizing film and theater? superb direction and great performances and the story sucks you in.
1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,"Hollywood at it's knockdown, drag out ""worst"" -- in regard to the story itself. Fine film with some really great individual scenes."

1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,"Bette Davis is so awesomely witty, and completely makes this film her own. Not to take anything away from Anne Baxter, who was wonderful herself, but you just don't go up against Bette Davis and expect to come out unscathed. Definitely a recommended movie!"
1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,This is my all time fav Movie!!!! they should do a remke of this movie but they have to make sure they get it RIGHT!

1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,"Burning with cynicism, rage and multiple layers. Massive standout performance from Bette. Revolutionary use of multiple perspectives to construct a tale. A great accompaniment to Sleuth, although much better actedPossibly the best film about acting ever realised"
1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,Loved loved LOVED this movie. A lot. Everything from the story to the acting was fantastic. It's a hard core look at what stardom and the drive to be famous can do to a person.
1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,The bitchiest film ever made. An outstanding script with dynamite performances. It's a brutal attack on Hollywood and the fanaticism with celebrities. Timeless and way ahead of its time. It makes a nice companion piece to both A Star is Born (with Garland) and Scorsese's King of Comedy.
1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,"I really, really love this movie, it is the best black-and-white movie ever!!!!! Performances are amazing, Bette Davis, Anne Baxter, George Sanders, Celeste Holm, and Thelma Ritter give such magnificient performances."

1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,"very weel acted and directed. plus, note how MM just steal the whole screen as she enters the scene."

1.0,1000626-all_about_eve,"Finally, a film with a female heroine and a female villain, and it's not a chick flick! Witty and smart dialogue with such devilish plot twists. I don't know anyone who can resist the charm of Bette Davis. ""Fasten your seatbelts, it's going to be a bumpy night!"""

1.0,let_the_right_one_in,"PHENOMENAL. True horror movie. Didn't need all that gore and nonsense american movies use, it scared me on a much deeper level too. What life would really be like if vampires were real. She doesn't need to sparkle, and she's more of a man than Edward."

So I found it even more interesting to find out details of the release of those held captive and about Canada's involvement in their rescue! Edge of your seat exciting! Scrip, acting and directing are all excellent!"
0.0,argo_2012,Although technically well executed it was just another example of Hollywood propaganda changing the story to make Americans look great and Canadians appear as though they'd contributed nothing or not been brave and not risked their lives.

1.0,argo_2012,"Affleck proves (again) how much of a credible director he is...and for those who say isn't the best of actors, perhaps that's down to quality of previous scripts he has worked with. This proves that he is one of the finest actor/director's working in Hollywood today."

1.0,argo_2012,"Initially I wasn't interested in seeing this, however it's really worth the watch."
1.0,argo_2012,A real good historical piece that gives you a brief look into the Iranian revolution and what it was like for the American Hostages. Also gives a good but brief glimpse of how it affected people at home. So far it seems Ben Affleck as a director can't make an awful movie.

1.0,argo_2012,Amazing! Great job future Batman!
1.0,argo_2012,Argo is such a special movie and based on an amazing story. While there are some added fictional elements for excitement. Argo recreates many true scenes as they took place during Iranian Hostage Crisis. You'll be on the edge of your seat.
1.0,argo_2012,"Argo is the embodiment of genuine, edge-of-your-seat cinema, even more so against its true story backdrop. Affleck is impeccable in both the leading role and as the films's director."

1.0,argo_2012,"Very engrossing story. Even if you come into it having read the back story (as I had) it's still a very engaging story with great performances by the cast and crew alike. Hopefully, this is Ben Affleck's Oscar picture. He deserves it...for his directing, at least."
1.0,argo_2012,"The ending was inevitable, but the suspense was so great I was sitting on the edge of my seat for 30 straight minutes. Kind of hurt my butt honestly."
1.0,argo_2012,"I found nothing wrong with this nail-biting, tense, edge-of-your-seat popcorn fick; a very deserving oscar winner for Best Picture and for my favourite film list of all time!"
1.0,argo_2012,"Terse and tightly constructed in a way that is somewhat rare from Hollywood. It's not quite a masterpiece, but it's not the ethnocentric piece of patriotism that some critics have said it is. Affleck is a masterful director (his acting here ain't even that bad) and he shows it. Amazing movie."

1.0,argo_2012,"Don't expect any high action battle scenes but this movie will still keep you tense to know how the outcome of all the hard work will turn out. I don't want to give out too much of the movie but as it states, this is all based on true events. You'll see what I mean."

1.0,argo_2012,"Ben Affleck directs and stars in this slickly made suspense/docudrama. The intensity is balanced out by humor (at the expense of late 70s Hollywood), creating a near perfect film. With this and his previous directing/starring effort (The Town), Affleck has really come into his own."

1.0,jaws,This is the type of movie that redefines a genre. We need more horror movies like Jaws.
1.0,jaws,Excitement beyond compare! Great acting!
1.0,moonlight_2016,It's not an enjoyable movie. Not because it's bad. Because it's so real and too deep. A flawless movie that definitely isn't for everyone.
1.0,moonlight_2016,"THE BEST FILM OF 2016! A coming-of-age piece that tells its main character's compelling life-story with three defining chapters of his life, and does so with spellbinding passion."
0.0,moonlight_2016,Praised by colleagues I gave it a try but found it unrelatable and kind of a stretch on reality
0.0,moonlight_2016,"African American, CHECK. Poor, CHECK. Drug addiction, CHECK. Gay, CHECK. This movie exists only to satisfy every Social Justice Warrior's wet dream..(pun intended). Boring, mindless, drivel that occurs in every inner city in the country. NOTHING special about this tripe."
0.0,moonlight_2016,Horrible. Terrible. Nothing to like about it.
0.0,moonlight_2016,"Awful movie, and I don't find many that I call awful. Just because a movie wins awards does not mean it is good. And that's the case here. I asked for my money back and have never done that"

0.0,moonlight_2016,What? there must be something I do not understand about this movie. Maybe I should watch it again.
1.0,moonlight_2016,It really brought me back to when I was young growing up in the inner city. And see the subject of sexuality in the black community as a white person is really interesting knowing the taboo of homosexuality. Film with character who had many layers.

1.0,1017293-rebecca,the perfect amount of twist and suspense.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Have on VHS. Saw this in October.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,One of the best movies ever made. Laurence Olivier is so sexy in this movie.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Easily my new favorite Hitchcock film. It might have even made its way into my top 10.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"I love this movie, it has a real classic Gothic feel to it, which was fairly rare for Hitchcock (though becomes less surprising when you realize it's based on a Daphne du Maurier story). Spooky and atmospheric greatness."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Early Hitchcock film, and the only one that got Hitchcock himself and Academy Award nomination. A widower takes a new young wife and brings her home. There she discovers some secrets from the creepy help about his previous wife, Rebecca."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"An absolutely glorious romance filled with mystery and intrigue and timeless beauty. Gloriously directed and perfectly cast, this movie sparkles darkly."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Another suspense movie by Alfred Hitchcock. Shone thru the eyes of the new wife.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"I had a number of people over to watch this movie once, and they all confessed to me that in the first few minutes, they thought, ""Oh. It's one of those boring OLD movies."" But every single person in the room ended up LOVING it. This movie is creepy, brilliantly acted, and totally Hitchcock's best!"
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Mrs. Danvers !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Good god I loved Hitchcock in the 40's! He really knew how to make romantic melodrama interesting and high tension-y.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,First-class thriller. Highly recommended.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Haunting gothic mystery detailing men (and women's) fear and attraction of the unrepressed woman.
0.0,1017293-rebecca,"Very boring and dated. Probably only gets high marks because it is Hitchcock, the ultimate hit and miss director."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Can Judith Anderson get any awesomer? Hitchcock's best.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,My favorite movie of all time!
1.0,1017293-rebecca,A true classic. This is must have for your collection.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Fantastically eerie and terrifying. Alfred Hitchcock is sublime! Laurence Olivier is perfect! Joan Fontaine is wonderful!
1.0,1017293-rebecca,I was pleasantly shocked about how close the movie stuck to the book. It was a good movie!
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Maybe one of Hitch's greatest. Both Joan Fontaine and Sir Laurence give great performances, but the real showstopper is that mansion, and the lighting/shadows, and the camera work ... fantastic! Oh, and the plot is very good too..."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,I love old black and white movies. This one is my favorite of them all! I love the guys swagger in this movie..I love men with smooth ass swagger.

1.0,1017293-rebecca,This is a Great movie!! Awesome!Been trying to remember what this movie was called for a long time. One of my Fav's!
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Classic Hitch. It was his first American made film. It won Selznick his 2nd Oscar in a row after GWTW. The perfect cast gives perfect performances. My fave Olivier role. He's dripping with sophistication, yet he has this lost boy layer underneath. And Mrs. Danvers? The ultimate embodiment of evil."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Excellent film. Olivier and Hitchcock? Simply amazing.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"chilling crime story, loved it"
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Extraordinary and terrifying and eerie. Hitchcock at his best!

1.0,1017293-rebecca,very memorable from over 30 years ago...
1.0,1017293-rebecca,This is my favorite Hitchcock film. I think the storyline and the acting is great and it makes for a very good ghost story.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,An amazing suspense classic that's not cheesy at all and a wonderful adaptation of the book.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"My Nanna recommended me to watch this and I'm so glad I did, it was really good and I have now bought it on DVD from PLAY. RIP Nanna xxx"
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Has by far become one of my favourite films! Has humour, sarcasm an irony, as well as ti gives you a bit of a chill ;)"
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Naive girl marries man she knows nothing about and moves to his big creepy house with it's creepy staff. The housekeeper, Mrs Danvers was brillant. Amazing film. The best Hitchock film I've ever seen."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"one of my favorite books/authors of all time. the movie does the book justice. excellent movie, a must see."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,This is definitely one of my favorite Hitchcock films.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"it's not the book, but it does keep you on the edge of your seat."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,creo que es lo mas parecido a un cuento de hadas que hizo Hitchcock pero aun as√≠ no deja de tener todos los elementos que nos mantiene en suspenso al borde de la silla
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Great book, great movie."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,One of my favourite Hitchcocks.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"One of the great romances of the silver screen, a film that men and women alike will enjoy..."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,i love it the book is great as well
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"I love old movies, specially when they suspence and romance."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Wonderful piece from Alfred Hitchcock in his first Hollywood movie, adapted from Daphne Du Maurier's much-loved novel. Despite not having the shock and suspense of his later work, this still shows Hitchcock as the master of the atmospheric movie."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Suspense in spades. Mrs. Danvers. Brrrrrrrr! Joan Fontaine cringing and cowering. And what an ensemble cast: Laurence Olivier, George Sanders, Gladys Cooper, Nigel Bruce, C. Aubrey Smith. With Hitchcock directing and David O. Selznick overmanaging every detail."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Though it's not really typical Hitchcock that people are used to, it's a wonderful movie! What woman doesn't compare herself to a former spouse, especially a deceased one who was beloved by all? We should all wish to NEVER have a housekeeper like Mrs. Danvers!"
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Being realistic, I think Ive seen this movie about 65 times this year because I never get sick of it. Not only showing how pathetic I am, but showing how great this movie is :P"
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Vintage Hitchcock, nothing more to say!! A B&W; classic. Even though u dont get to see who Rebecca is, but you feel her thro' out the movie. A great psychological thriller. Watch out the scene where the new wife is persuaded to commit suicide by Mrs. Denvers. Hitchcock @ his best!"
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Beautifully sinister and understated Hitchcock masterpiece about grief and obsession.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Simply awesome. Laurence Olivier is really everything is cracked up to be and so is Hitchcock. I have not seen Joan Fontaine in many films but she was great in this.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,One of my top 3 movies ever...........and my favorite Hitchcock movie. Joan Fontaine is perfect in this movie.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"It's not one of my favorite Hitchcock films (I prefer the psychological complexity of Vertigo or Shadow of a Doubt), but Rebecca is without a doubt one of his most solid, well-concieved, and flat-out best."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"After Rear Window, this is my favorite Hitchcock movie!! Hitchcock has done an amazing job directing the adaptation of this timeless novel..."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"I think this is the best movie Hitchcock made and he made some good ones. it's also an excelent adaptation of the novel, even though some important things are changed it is forgivable if the result is this masterpiece"
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Really, really good."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,one of the all-time best Hitchcock thrillers!
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"So much fun, but still sophisticated. You wouldn't know Hitchcock directed it without seeing the credits, for it lacks his usual tight structure and other trademarks. However, the eerieness never lets up. Mrs. Danvers is the creepiest craziest person ever- and I love her for it!"
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Fantastic Hitchcock film. Loved it!
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"hitchcock's first american film! it's just beautifully made and a really fun story. george sanders is his usual sleazy ambiguously gay self, and olivier is just a fucking fox."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"buenisima!!, buena trama, buenas locaciones !"
1.0,1017293-rebecca,A must see. One of Hitchcock's best but one of his most under-heard.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,This is my all-time favorite movie.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Yes, Larry Olivier did Hitchcock! Most bizarre!"
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"So after seeing this, I think that Vertigo, North by Northwest, and now Rebecca are my favorite Hitchcock films."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Hitchcocks b√É¬§sta film!
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"AMAZING movie. As if Laurence Oliver's being in it doesn't already make it a 5-star movie, it has a GREAT storyline. Rebecca-- SEE IT."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"This movie is why Alfred Hitchcock is my favorite director, Hitchcocks finest film. Wonderful musical score, mysterious and haunting. I just love films and B&W; and Alfred Hitchcock was a genius at directing which makes it a treat when watching his films."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"An early masterpiece from Hitchcock. I'm ashamed that I hadn't seen it until now, it won best picture for a reason. It seems to not have aged, and the acting and cinematography is spectacular. Very highly recommended!"
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"I prefer a lot of the older Hitchcock works--I think they're overlooked because they're not in color, but Rebecca has all the drama and suspense of Vertigo. Plus, it opens with a model shot, and I always love those."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Incredible book - incredible movie.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,this movie literally hypnotized me... it was creepy and beautiful and there was not a moment i guessed right
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Again, brilliant. This may be my favorite Hitchcock film actually."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,one of the best films of the master
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Great movie! Mrs. Danvers is terrifying, and the story is wonderful!"
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Another great Hitchcock film. Suspenseful. Based on book by Daphne DuMaurier.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Fell in love with Joan Fontaine for a while after seeing this for the first time. It was the start of my fascination with golden age cinema and with Hitchcock. I love this film, and it has the best name of all time - George Fortesque Maximilian De Winter."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,The storyline is very tense and I think the mannerisms of each character are very accurate in terms of establishing the very distinctive role they have in the film.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,I love Hitchcock and this is my favorite movie of all time.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,my favorite Hitchcock film.
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"This somehow gets forgotten amidst the flashy 50's and 60's Hitchcocks, but. This is really one of his spooky best... With one of the most chilling bad-guys (Mrs. Danvers) in movies."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Loved it. Again, the lovely Jon Fontaine!"
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Based on the novel by Daphne Du Maurier, this ""modern Gothic"" is the only Hitchcock film to win Best Picture. Laurence Olivier is perfect and never handsomer as Maxim de Winter, and Joan Fontaine steals your heart as his mousy new wife, but Judith Anderson is haunting as Mrs. Danvers."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"this is in the top 10 fave. movies for me. so suspenseful, fantastic ending !!"
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Excellent film with a dead woman running the show seemingly. Joan Fontaine as the no name bride of Maxwell DeWinter (Laurence Olivier) who's dead wife haunts him. But Why????

1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Without a doubt Hitchcock's most unique film. Creepy, beautiful, and wonderfully mysterious; not only absorbs you in a character who never once appears on screen, but in the others who do as well. Magnificent."

1.0,1017293-rebecca,"Wonderful Hitchcock and so subtly creepy. One of my favorites, not only because of the terrific script and acting by the leads, but of Mrs. Danvers. What a haunting impression this woman leaves on you."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,"A perfect adaptation of Daphne Du Maurier's gothic classic! Olivier and Fontaine made for a superb cast, and the entire movie from start to finish was every bit as tense, thrilling and gripping as the book. You cant go wrong with Hitchcock I guess."
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Classicly creepy. Its probably my favorite Hitchcock
1.0,1017293-rebecca,Atmospheric & dark. The protrayal of Mrs Danvers is truly chilling. Joan Fontaine was perfectly cast in this movie.

1.0,nightcrawler,Unbelievably good performance by Jake Gyllenhaal and a great commentary on TV news.
1.0,nightcrawler,One of the best movies of the decade... easily. So much thrill the first time I watched this movie. So much suspense and emotion. I can't find any faults with this film. It's seems to be perfect and is easily one of my favorite Drama/Thriller movies.
1.0,nightcrawler,"A movie that transcends the cinema as it really shows how the world of news is really ran. Gyllenhaal's performance is so amazing, his level of sleaziness made me want to take a shower after watching. RIP Bill Paxton."
1.0,nightcrawler,"A chilling performance by Jake Gyllenhaal creates an original film unlike any before. Filled with great dialogue and beautiful visuals, ""Nightcrawler"", exposes the depths to which some people go to attain fame and does it convincingly."
0.0,nightcrawler,Couldn't even get through it; very slow
0.0,nightcrawler,Jake Gyllenhaal character has an annoying factor that makes it hard to watch. I was disappointed.
1.0,nightcrawler,"One of the best independent movies ever made. 2014s ""Taxi Driver"""
1.0,nightcrawler,"It's so intense and brutal, amazing performance from Jake, he looked the part too which was terrifyingly impressive. Overall it's quite a scary film where obsession of what you love could drive you crazy and be the death of you."
1.0,nightcrawler,"It is haunting in every way, and gives you a Network vibe until the last scene of the movie. Journalists going way out of bounds of morality and ethics for the sake of acquiring good TV ratings. Nice thrilling movie.Jake Gyllenhall gives one of the most enthralling performances of the year."
1.0,nightcrawler,"Brilliantly acted, amazingly written, and an original plot. What more can you ask for?"

1.0,nightcrawler,"Jake Gyllenhaal gives a strong performance as the creepy, psychopathic monster, Lou Bloom. Bloom takes a liking to freelance crime journalism and becomes very disturbing and menacing in the process. Definitely on of Jake Gyllenhaal's best performances. Rene Russo was also strong in her performance."
1.0,nightcrawler,"Well done. To me this a character study of the textbook psychopath. He is ambitious, callous, glib, intelligent and deeply self centered. They walk among us, Very complex layers of insanity. I really enjoyed watching this."

1.0,nightcrawler,"Dark, thrilling and thought-provoking."

1.0,nightcrawler,He's really weird but it's a great film.

1.0,nightcrawler,"He[Gyllenhaal]dissapears into this character and you do not see the actor,you see the character.The film itself was ok and could've been better but the twisted,eccentric and thrilling performance Mr.Gyllenhaal gives us is compelling.Note to the Academy:Give Jake Gyllenhaal the Oscar nod."
1.0,nightcrawler,"'Nightcrawler' is a taut, knuckle-whitening thriller that takes audiences on one hell of a ride. Jake Gyllenhaal gives the best performance of his career (and one of the best of any movie that year), and seems to be having a blast messing with people's heads."

1.0,nightcrawler,This movie blew my mind!
1.0,nightcrawler,Great movie. Love the suspense.
1.0,nightcrawler,"Nightcrawler is a wickedly funny satire on journalism, showing insights about the moral vacancy of TV news. But it's Gylenhaal's darkly comic, sometimes unnerving performance as the bleakly determined anti-hero that gives it its psychological richness."
1.0,nightcrawler,"Thoroughly enjoyed this. Gyllenhaal wears a wonderfully blank mask as he attempts to pass himself off as a normal when in reality, he's a disturbing individual with a screwed moral compass"

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"A movie filled with beautiful, haunting images, and brilliant in it's manner of showing both sides of a struggle in equal light. For some reason the scene where the crowd of children pushes the drunk down the stairs will stay with me for long."

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Excellent. Very realistic move about anti-colonial insurrection and urban warfare. French colonial rule in Algeria and its parallels with Iraq are unmistakable.

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"What a movie, in some ways filmed like a documentary. its raw and violent, quite uncompromising. Shows the utter brutalities commited on each side, FLN are portrayed as well organised urban guerillas, who carry on the fight even when all looks hopeless. Dont miss the Ennio Morricone score either"
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,why oh why have I waited this long to see it?? Amongst the rarest of truly greats to grace our screens. It'll visually blow your mind to bits. A hard lesson for all the warmongers and bullies that they'll get theirs sooner or later.

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"Quite simply the most exceptional and true to life screen depiction of revolution (I think, although the only revolution I've actually seen is from the MLS). Also, it shows up the French and surely that's a good thing (I think?)"
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Filled with more political symbolism than you can shake a baton at.
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"Real and powerful. A must see. Morricone's music adds to the impact. Impossible to remain unimpressed by Algeria's courageous women. In all, a political journey that gratifies with rare glimpses of the deep alleyways hidden in Algiers' Casbah."

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Best movie of all time.
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,This movie was meant to be a manifesto against colonialism enforced by military power. Nowadays the French general looks more like the prototype of the perfect American soldier determined to fight against terrorism. The 9/11 campaign has changed our view about many things.
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Marvelous and very ahead of its time.
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Pontecorvo's stunningly realised rendition of the struggle against colonialism remains must see viewing for any would be imperialist.

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Amazing B&W; movie shot shortly after the Algerian independence with some of the actual people involved in the uprising. This movie is a historical gem because it shows both sides and does so with many of the people that participated in this part of history.

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"Cold-blooded assasinations, street shoutouts, cafe bombings, riots and torture are the tools used by the Algierian insurgents and occupying French. The warts of both warring factions are shown on both sides in this depressingly familiar, yet utterly fascinating, documentary-style war picture."
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Very much a film a film for now. Wonderful chronicle of events. A great unbiased view on terrorism and the people doing it.

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,allright you lefty revolutionaries. Here's the real deal.
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Should be required viewing for all wannabe imperialists.
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"The cinematograpy, the acting, the story all place this movie as one of the best ever made.

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"A supreme film about the battle of Algiers, watch the version with a native (as I did, with two of my Algerian mates) as some of the subtitles are wrong (purposely) or missing. Was banned in France for over 20 years or something. Oh yeah and the brilliant music is partly by Ennio Morricone."
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Pontecorvo's stunningly realised rendition of the struggle against colonialism remains must see viewing for any would be imperialist.
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,Staggering. A real highpoint of the development of cinema. The whole bombing sequence in the middle of the picture is rivetting. Morricone and Pontecorvo's musical choices remain striking to this day.

1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"This film has become more significant each year since its release in 1967. It is a very realistic portrayal of the Algerian anti-colonial terrorism campaign which demonizes neither the French nor the Algerians, but points out their strengths and weaknesses."
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,"A Post-colonial, cin√©ma v√©rit√© masterpiece. Pontecorvo casted non-professional Algerian Arabs and Gatti shot the film in such a way to make it look like a newsreel or documentary film."
1.0,the_battle_of_algiers,The fact that this has been screened to US government officials to analyze terrorist behavior should speak volumes.

1.0,discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie,The satire here is so very sharp. Bunuel has fangs and he's not afraid to bare them. In addition he plays with the form so masterfully; there are dreams within dreams. One is never quite sure where one is. No one gets off without a skewering.

1.0,discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie,Bunuel was a genius. This film is so surreal. I love it. Great satire. Need to see this one again so I can enjoy all the little gags he does with the dreams. I especially enjoyed when they get arrested towards the end.

0.0,discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie,"How dissappointing. I'd wanted to watch this for years but it wasn't what I'd hoped for. I've seen other Bunuel films I've liked but this was TOO pretentious (and for me to say that, it must have been bad)"

1.0,discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie,Esta pel√≠cula entiende lo que es un sue√±o..por eso es una obra maestra
1.0,discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie,"One of the great masterpieces in cinema and so applicable in everyday life. 6 people try to have dinner but never pull it off. This is a metaphor for so many things such as nights when you notice 1:45AM and you say to yourself ""I haven't eaten yet. How is this possible?"""
1.0,discreet_charm_of_the_bourgeoisie,"A lot of interesting themes. Clearly a dark humor film, very unique and played out the way Marx would appreciate it. Wasn't there a version from '72? ""Le Charme Discret De La Bourgeoisie"", this version was more than a classic. Serve the drinks."

1.0,repulsion,when a filmmaker has a voice that is undeniable..
1.0,repulsion,"Holy what the hell AMAZING! I had never seen this, just watched first time, blown away. Catherine Deneuve is outstanding. Edgy, scary, descent into madness doesn't quite do it."
1.0,repulsion,"Polanski is masterful behind the camera, especially in his use of space. It's very gutsy and how disturbing it is is evidence of just that."
1.0,repulsion,"The perfect psychological reading that is generated in 'Repulsion' captures in very minute details the terrifying process towards total madness. If the fall to psychosis was a window into damnation, Polanski captures the very near hell of visual and sonorous master-class mosaics. 99/100"
1.0,repulsion,"While not only is this film so disturbing that you will feel as if you should take a shower after you finish it, it is also unbelievably heartbreaking in a realistic perspective. Which is why I think Repulsion is one of the best horror films of all time, even if it is a different kind of horror."
1.0,repulsion,"If you don't have claustrophobia organically, you'll likely have developed it in some form after watching this one. Another hit by Polanski. Once again Art House though... Part of The Criterion Collection and on Blu-ray in the US."
1.0,repulsion,"A disturbing, claustrophobic thriller with a fantastic performance by Catherine Deneuve and eerily effective sound design and camerawork"

1.0,repulsion,"This is maybe the only movie that scared me. And it's weird, because it doesn't have gory imagery or something like that. This movie really plays with your mind. Everything works perfect. Watch it alone at night and have some nightmares."

0.0,repulsion,WHY was this in my queue?? Is netflix messing with me?! That was an hour and 40 mins I won't get back. :-(
1.0,repulsion,A disturbing film that hollows through a world of hallucination with unsettling horror.
1.0,repulsion,"My favourite Polanski film, this nightmarish trip into isolation and madness builds up tension and atmosphere, taking its audience hostage amid the claustrophobia and terror. The final shot (the photograph of Carol) is still one of the most powerful images in film history."

1.0,repulsion,One of the greatest psychological thrillers ever and very disturbing. Catherine Deneuve makes her best performance here.

1.0,repulsion,One of the best psychological horror films that I have ever seen. Polanski is a master of building suspense in the confines of small spaces.
1.0,repulsion,This was really something. The score. The acting. The terror. Polanski has dark sorceress powers. Completely redefines the horror movie. It's pure greatness.
1.0,repulsion,"If you have seen Black Swan and liked it, you will love this. It is even better, the original film about a schizophrenic's slow decent into madness. Absolutely astounding performance from Catherine Deneuve."
1.0,repulsion,Classic.  Catherine Deneuve is a complete stunner. Great score that fits the film perfectly by Chico Hamilton.
1.0,repulsion,Had me wincing in sheer anticipation of horror and jump out of my seat. And this was made before CGI and makeup. Roman Polanski's creepily atmospheric psychological drama about the slow descent of a girl into madness should be revered by the horror fans.
1.0,repulsion,Roman polanskis first english film follows a schizopherenic womans descent into madness and makes the audience feel as clausthrophic as the character
1.0,repulsion,We start off as innocent as the girl can be but slowly and murkily do we descend to a great pit of turmoil and disturbance. Excellent work from Polanski.
1.0,repulsion,Repulsion compels the viewer to be as claustrophobic as the paranoid lead woman as she journeys into insanity.
1.0,repulsion,Fianlly just saw this film and i'm not disappointed to movie is a masterpicie . This shows off the fPolanksis full potienal in theis surealist look in the a insaine mind. it obisouly shows its influence on directors like Lynch and Argento
1.0,repulsion,Deneuve showed that she could understand a director unlike any other actress who ever lived. Polanski's visuals and her acting make this one of the finest depictions of the descent into madness ever.
1.0,repulsion,Hands down the best Roman Polanski film in my humble opinion. And he's got a lot of good ones.

1.0,repulsion,"Early Polanski. If you have seen Knife in the Water and not this, imagine a movie that has just as many emotions as knife in the water, but represented through visuals of even more horror and beauty, you get this. Polanski's first horror film and arguably his best (maybe tied with Rosemary's Baby)."
1.0,repulsion,Polanski is great and knows how to make characters!
1.0,repulsion,"Repulsion, is an emotion you certainly won't feel while watching this intense, expertly crafted masterpiece."
1.0,repulsion,"An unsettling and unfortunate story which attempts to expound a virgin's fearfull perspective on sexual relations. This, combined with elements of real physical peril and mental illness, makes for a fascinated film. Typical slow Polanski build-up and revolutionary camera work."
1.0,repulsion,"Catherine Deneuve is perfect as the disturbed, sexually repressed young french girl in Roman Polankski's masterpiece about paranoia and sexuality. Amazing."
1.0,repulsion,"Absolutely terrifying, and beautifully filmed."

1.0,repulsion,May very well be Polanski's best film
0.0,repulsion,"Very disappointing. Pretentious piece of ""art""."
1.0,repulsion,This was made in 1965 and is still pretty impressive. The directing style is fantastic! Catherine Denevue's schizophrenia mixed in with her deep sexual impulses makes this film original and a gem.
1.0,repulsion,Very strange film about claustrophobia by roman polanski not really scary but it is a overall well done masterpiece for its time beautifully well done very thrilling movie and great screenplay co written by Polanski himself highly recommended

0.0,repulsion,polanski is a child rapist
0.0,repulsion,"Perhaps this was ""substantial"" when it came out, and is a classic that people reference, but nowadays it's simply terrible. Prepare to be bored out of your mind by a character you have no reason to care about, and distracted from the suspense by over the top techniques."

1.0,repulsion,this movie is cold! polanksi is greatness
1.0,repulsion,This is one of the creepiest movies I have ever seen. I was as paranoid about the protagonist as I was her antagonist - loneliness. This is the kind of movie that makes you want to lock your doors and put yourself in a straitjacket.
1.0,repulsion,"Outstanding Deneuve in taut,nerve-cracking,misogyne thriller.Shall not miss it."
1.0,repulsion,"An enthralling, if not enchanting, work of art in a habitual genre to its audience at the time, but supposing that not half of the world have known yet the young talented Polanski, this film would have been his first masterpiece to reach them in a remark it would be remembered as a historical piece."
1.0,repulsion,An unquestionably perfect film.
1.0,repulsion,"The character development, the repetitions, the maddening background noises, the surreal imagery, the flawless camera direction, the empathy, the symbolism, the widening cracks..."
1.0,repulsion,This is the film Black Swan wanted to be. A flawless early effort from Roman Polanski.
1.0,repulsion,"The movie was made in 1965, though it's incorrectly dated on here as 1997. That annoyance aside, the film was genuinely terrifying and really stays with you, whether you want it too or not. Right up there with Jacob's Ladder for my all time favorite horror films."

1.0,repulsion,"One of the first Roman Polanski movies, it's a chilling masterpiece about woman's decent into madness."
1.0,repulsion,hey .... why in title is year 1997? .... It's a movie from 1965 ...
1.0,repulsion,"I don't throw around 5/5 easily, but Polanski's first English film (1965 London) is spot-on perfection. 100% on Rottentomatoes."
1.0,repulsion,"Polanski's first film of his urban terrors trilogy is efective simply because you can't never guess what is coming up next; I'm not easily impressed, but this one made me jump off my couch three times."
1.0,repulsion,"GREATTTT! film, starts out a little slow then really gets crazy. One of Polanski's ""Apartment Trilogy."" They are all good, but this one is quite insane."
1.0,repulsion,"Wierd, Yet Entertaining"
1.0,repulsion,"Haunting and claustrophobic, Repulsion places you in the room with it's disturbed protagonist, her degenerating psyche creating terrifying hallucinations, until she lashes out with violence to stop them. A classic Polanski nightmare."
1.0,repulsion,The absolute best movie I have ever seen about a woman descending into madness apart from Woman Under the Influence. I should just make a note that the criterion edition of this is MAGNIFICENT. SO CRISP & SHARP.
0.0,repulsion,"Awfully boring, then it gets annoying, and at the end a little bit interesting. Only for respect of the old perv Polanski watched till the end."
1.0,repulsion,A masterpiece from Polish master Roman Polanski. One of the most pygoloically distrubing films out there. This film is a looking into the isane and delsional mind of Carol Ledoux(played by Catherine Deneuve). Sureal and very atosphereic. This film shows that anyone can snap even you and even me.
1.0,repulsion,"Film Psychedelikohorrifique, un chef d'oeuvre noir et blanc d'une justesse et sobri√©t√© implacable et prenante."
1.0,repulsion,Repulsion is probably the best psychological thriller I've seen. A true masterpiece from a real genius Roman Polanski (Though I know he's charged with a rape case!). Don't forget lovely Catherine Deneuve:)
1.0,repulsion,"Not comfortable viewing, but for a reason. Polanski devastatingly interpets what too much isolation can do to the psyche... Draw your own conclusions."
1.0,repulsion,LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVED THIS MOVIE.
0.0,repulsion,I know I will be in the minority here but I was really dissapointed with Repulsion. Being a big Polanski fan I had been meaning to see this for some time and had high expectations. Some disturbing scenes which were good but the film just didn't seem to connect with me unlike his other works.
1.0,repulsion,Excellent... might type more laters.
1.0,repulsion,"An unsettling masterpiece, with a brilliant performance by Catherine Deneuve."
1.0,repulsion,"Absolutely horrifying. Catherine Deneuve is stunning, but I'll never be able to see her the same way again."
1.0,repulsion,"No one does a classier rape scene than Roman Polanski, The Devil and Rosemary is at the top of the list, but there were multiple ones in this so.........."

1.0,repulsion,Disgusting. Shocking. Disturbing. Amazing.
1.0,repulsion,"The best movie Polanski has ever done, and along with The Hour of the Wolf the best paranoid movie ever."
1.0,repulsion,"This movie was a complete shock to me. I went in not expecting much, and came out hooked, compelled and excited. Barely anyone I know has seen this, but I recommend it. A slow burn that will build in tension, paranoia, and most importantly dread. Great oldie"
1.0,repulsion,"I'd have to say this is among one of my favourites now among the few really well done psychological-thrillers, such as Mulholland Dr. and Memento."
1.0,repulsion,Roman Polanski's first English language film (second overall) is perhaps the greatest psychological drama ever made. Check it out!

1.0,repulsion,"Alienation captured. We get to go into the depths of confusion. Polanski is able to strip away the veneer of civilization and manners. We see people in all of their rawness, and it isn't pretty."

1.0,repulsion,crazy film! definitely one of the most disturbing films i've seen. this has so much more depth than your average thriller. and Catherine Deneuve gives a very powerful performance.
1.0,repulsion,Polanski at his some of his most disturbing and innovative. Objects and lighting are key in progressing the unraveling of an already head-case. The dead rabbit is the thickest layer of visual metaphor. The violence has high anticipation but shocking in its honesty.
0.0,repulsion,color me unimpressed. there's a reason polanski ain't allowed in the u.s. he's a sick *#%$er.
1.0,repulsion,"The most unnerving film I've seen. The more closely I watch it, the more signs of the girl's increasing insanity I pick up on. The most disturbing thing of all is that anyone in passing may be about to snap. Anyone. If seen in a theater you may want to lock your car door for the drive home."
1.0,repulsion,the very best film of Polanski

1.0,repulsion,"a work of pure artthough it is dark, it conveys so much about the stream between normal consciousness and psychosis"
1.0,repulsion,Repulsion is the first of the tenant nightmares presented by Roman Polanksi. Brilliantly constructed. One of the best horror movies. Nobody understands horror movies like Polanksi.

1.0,repulsion,sultry psycho deneuve freaks out in swinging 60's Soho. silly rabbit!
1.0,repulsion,"I found this movie interesting. The way in which the camera moves to show the girls obsessions, fantasies and hallucinations is creative. Definatly different type of movie, for that era also. Very beyond its years."
1.0,repulsion,"Along with Eraserhead and Inland Empire, this is probably the best horror movie I've ever seen. If you are more terrified of mental illness than of men in hockey masks, this film is for you. Roman Polanski's debut feature and the introduction of Catherine Deneuve to the world. Remarkable."

1.0,repulsion,"beautiful movie, an atmosphere that can hunt you in your dreams"
1.0,repulsion,"Truly amazing. And that's all due to the lead actress' very convincing and hauntingly realistic portrayal of a disturbed young woman, as well as Polanski's rather incredible direction . This film is pitch perfect as far as eerie or just outright frightening psychological thrillers go."
0.0,repulsion,"I barely made it passed the hour mark before I shut it off. Not because it's so ""terrifying"" and ""shocking"" as some people seem to think, but because it's horribly boring. Psychological thrillers were never really my genre anyways."
1.0,repulsion,The ultimate mindfuck.
1.0,repulsion,"When it comes to claustrophobic, paranoid horror movies, Polanski is the king and this is definitely the best."

1.0,repulsion,This is a very good movie that no one remembers any more. Just look at the camera. A psychological thriller were the camera is the main character. The soul of a sick girl is revealed through the lens.

1.0,repulsion,"Another frightening, psychological masterpiece from Polanski. Its haunting, well crafted, briliantly acted."
1.0,repulsion,"I don't know what to say about this movie? The movie left me with my mouth open and speechless. If your a woman I'm sure you can relate with the main character and her discuss toward men, but never take it as far as she did. I definitely recommend it, Polanski is a deranged man!"

0.0,anatomy-of-a-murder,"Tedious and boring, might have been cutting edge in 1959. The only interesting thing about this movie was seeing how much more liberal we have become in society."

1.0,anatomy-of-a-murder,"This is Otto Preminger at the top of his game, and also James Stewart at the same top as well. The film is interesting, thought provoking, and still relevant to this day."

1.0,anatomy-of-a-murder,"it's not just murder mystery, it's involves social psychology of people."
1.0,anatomy-of-a-murder,The best court drama I've ever seen. Jimmy Stewart is incredibly convincing in his role. George C. Scott also gives an intimidating performance as Claude Dancer. The film also has a good balance of humor throughout.

1.0,anatomy-of-a-murder,A masterpiece of the courtroom drama genre.
1.0,anatomy-of-a-murder,"The intrigue of this movie comes from the fact that your mind will not agree with your emotions. As I was trying to determine the verdict for myself, my emotions were pulling me one way while my mind was pulling me the other. It was a great cinematic tug of war."
1.0,anatomy-of-a-murder,I think the best courtroom drama ever made. A slyly written and wonderfully acted movie. It's just another in a long line of great Jimmy Stewart films.

1.0,anatomy-of-a-murder,Court room drama at its best
0.0,anatomy-of-a-murder,This is too childish to be enjoyed.
1.0,anatomy-of-a-murder,Could this be the perfect courtroom drama? Stewart is exceptional when he alternates between slyness and almost pointless outbursts. The ending is perhaps no big surprise but that is a minor inconveniance. No stellar marks on the gender-meter though.
1.0,anatomy-of-a-murder,The best Stewart movie made. not least because it was filmed on location in the U.P.
1.0,anatomy-of-a-murder,This is a mature and brilliant courtroom drama with great performances and smart dialogue. It also pushes the boundries of what kind of dialogue and language was allowed in 50s films. James Stewart is excellent and the rest of the film is dramatic and suspenseful :fresh:
1.0,anatomy-of-a-murder,One of the best courtroom dramas ever.
1.0,anatomy-of-a-murder,"Another wonderful vehicle for perhaps the most loved actor ever to grace the silver screen.

1.0,anatomy-of-a-murder,"Wow. This is easily the best courtroom drama I've yet seen. Fantastic acting, an extremely complex story line, and blurred morality among every character makes the 160 minute running time never feel even the slightest bit boring. 5 stars."

1.0,anatomy-of-a-murder,It came out in 1959 not 1939. It was filmed in the Marquette Courthouse in Michigan in the up. The courtroom is still the same.

1.0,night_of_the_hunter,"I must have watched this movie at least a dozen times. It is wholly unique - its tone blackly comic, the storyline a hybrid of Grimm's fairytale and pursuit thriller. It is our loss that Laughton never directed another movie: with just this one work he proved he was one of the greats."

1.0,night_of_the_hunter,A chilling nightmare. Any film that has me literally clutching a pillow with white knuckles has accomplished something. Robert Mitchum is a terrifying villain who paints a religious allegory that may be more applicable to today's society than it was to that of the mid-50's.

1.0,night_of_the_hunter,"The Night of the Hunter raises important questions about the darker side of religious faith and the chilling ways in which people condone their actions through their belief. Expressing as much through its effulgent lighting as through its haunting themes, it is a film of incredible visual appeal."
1.0,night_of_the_hunter,"A masterpiece and one of the most beautiful black-and-white movies I have ever seen. If Terrence Malick wasn't at least slightly influenced by this movie, I'll eat my shoe.**not to be taken seriously."

1.0,night_of_the_hunter,"Fantastic and unforgettable movie. Mitchum is more than superb as a perfectly evil wolf in sheep's clothing.

1.0,night_of_the_hunter,One cannot approach this film with the usual expectations. But no matter the opinion of a viewer upon the plot - it must admitted Robert Mitchum's portrayal of a fanatic preacher-psychokiller is excessive and frightening - and to a delightful degree.
1.0,night_of_the_hunter,"Gothic tale with the most memorable villain, the most memorable visual, the most engagin script.

1.0,night_of_the_hunter,"An underrated American masterpiece that can't be conveniently placed in any one category. It contains elements of horror, fantasy, comedy and expressionism that blend together into a truly unique cinematic experience. Robert Mitchum's performance is one for the ages as well."
1.0,night_of_the_hunter,"Great suspense film with maybe the best use of children in danger in cinema, and perhaps Robert Mitchum's best performance. Too bad Charles Laughton didn't direct more movies."
1.0,night_of_the_hunter,A masterpiece. The thriller/horror directors of today could learn a thing or two from this film. Laughton's direction is stunning -- I wish he made more films -- and Mitchum is a force of nature. See it now.
1.0,night_of_the_hunter,"Excellent. The cinematography and lighting are some of the best of all time. If that's not enough, Robert Mitchum gives the best performance of his career. Dammit Charles Laughton, why was the ONLY film you ever directed???"
1.0,night_of_the_hunter,This is still bizarre and creepy 50 years later. No other movie is remotely similar to this.

1.0,night_of_the_hunter,"Two movies in one, 5 stars each, is it a 10 star movie?"
1.0,night_of_the_hunter,"The only film Sir Charles Laughton ever directed. Amazing and disturbing, this film boasts the first helicopter shot ever filmed for a movie. A must see, Shelly Winters at her best. Read the book if you get the chance!"
1.0,night_of_the_hunter,incredibly dark and frightening.truly one of the greatest thrillers ever filmed.
1.0,night_of_the_hunter,"This movie is best watched, late a night with all the lights out. Doesn't seem at all dated even after 50 years. Mitchum is far more scarier then anything Jason or Freddy could ever dream up."
1.0,night_of_the_hunter,Mitchum plays his characher so well its chilling. The scene in the basement when he is looking for the kids is really good.
1.0,night_of_the_hunter,Robert mitchum in his best role. Fantastic film and superb soundtrack.Hate and Love!!!

1.0,night_of_the_hunter,"The only movie ever from Charles Laughton, a real pity. Considered crap when it was released, it eventually garnered huge acclaim. I saw this in film class in 1996 and love this it. When my ex wife and I divorced, I kept her DVD of this. She wouldn't appreciate it."

1.0,night_of_the_hunter,"Surreal adult fairytale. Remarkable Freudian touch. In all its seemingly badly paced storyline weirdness one of the most interesting films I've seen.Especially the ""Look at your sins!"" - scene. God damn!"
1.0,night_of_the_hunter,"Clearly some people dont get this film. Mitchum's performance is meant to be completely over the top as he is playing something of a grotesque, fairytale villain. And thats what this film is; part expressionist fairytale, part horror thriller. It is pure concept cinema."
1.0,night_of_the_hunter,"Stunning, ageless and scary as hell."
1.0,night_of_the_hunter,"For some reason, this has always been one of my favorite movies. Mitchum is great as the creepy con man/pastor- one his best roles. Its a dark movie and you are not sure how it will turn out."
1.0,night_of_the_hunter,"I always think ""The Night of the Hunter"" is the most unintentionally perfect film ever made ."

1.0,night_of_the_hunter,Brilliant old movie that really shows off what good cinematography can do. Also has an amazing performance by Robert Mitchum and fully deserves its reputation.
1.0,night_of_the_hunter,"eerie,robert mitchums best role as a lunatic conman who infiltrates a small town by marrying a single mum played by the great shelley winters"
1.0,night_of_the_hunter,Robert Mitchum is the most frightening villain of all time and the scenes of the kids on the river are absolutely stunning.

1.0,night_of_the_hunter,"Visually, it's everything anyone who appreciates the cinema could ask for. Expressionist and surreal. Robert Mitchum is the very definition of ""menacing""."
1.0,night_of_the_hunter,"ce chef-d'oeuvre est une vraie merveille, robert mitchum incarne parfaitement le mal dans une histoire hautement symbolique, excellent, √† conseiller"
1.0,night_of_the_hunter,"I never liked Mitchum before, but this film made me a believer. Astonishingly surreal imagery, too. Even the sappy ending can't ruin it. I am waiting for an announcement of a big budget remake with Renny Harlin directing, so I can kill myself (kidding, kidding)."
1.0,night_of_the_hunter,First and last film with Laughton behind the cameras. Mitchum's was one of the best plays ever.
0.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"This has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting is okay. The story, characters, cinematography, dialogue, etc. is clumsy and incredibly, incredibly boring."

1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"In my humble opinion, Touch of Evil is arguably Orson Welles' directorial masterpiece. Only Chimes at Midnight rivals it."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Orson Welles closed the book on the traditional golden age of Film Noir with Touch of Evil. Aside from the incredibly skilled 3 minute and 20 second long take opening of the film, you also get to witness Charlton Heston play a Mexican! That's worth seeing alone!"
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"""If you are mean enough to steal from the blind, help yourself"""
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Just pure brilliance right from the start. Hypnotic and truly magic. It is films like this that make you believe in cinema as an art form
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,One of the best films of all time.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,One of the greatest films ever! And Orson Welles' best film - better than Citizen Kane. The predecessor of so many movie tropes its a pity so many can only now view it as an amalgamation of cliches.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Otra genialidad de Orson Welles, merece mas que cinco estrellas, con uno de los inicios mas impactantes y de una sola toma hechos en la historia del cine."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"It was Welles' penance. If he could bring it in on time and on budget he would get better choices. Well he did and the studio dumped it. The joke was on them, though, as it's a stunning film."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"OMG, the opening sequence! 'OMG' has finally found its gasp-inducing match. An achievement in every aspect of film-making.Delightful!"
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"As long as you don't find Charlton Heston playing a Mexican too distracting, you're in for quite possibly the most intense psychological thriller of the black-and-white era."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Essential to watch for any serious film fan or filmmaker. Incredible shots and innovative direction bring Orson Wells genius out forefront!
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Uma obra-prima de Orson Welles, mesmo n√£o saindo do jeito que ele planejou (j√° nessa √©poca os est√∫dios eram problem√°ticos), ainda sim √© um belo Noir (mesmo abrindo m√£o alguns elementos tradicionais do g√™nero) e o emblem√°tico plano-sequ√™ncia de abertura."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Love Charlton Heston, and Orson Welles' acting is excellent as usual. The shots are killer. It's not that they don't make 'em like they used to, they just don't make 'em like Orson Welles used to."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"An effortlessly stylish, thoughtfully emotional Crime/Thriller/Noir which feels suspiciously like a selection of previously separated narratives, now combined into a glorious affair of wonder for the mind and the eye; each step in the films winding continuation being more captivating than the last."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Personally I believe this to be Welles' best film over Citizen Kane.

1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Amazing in every aspect I'd argue and say this is Orson Well's best movie.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Orson Welles at his best. Even Heston's typical overacting cannot prevent this film form being great.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,An amazingly bold film for its time with still a lot of power even in this new century.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Masterpiece - every shot is perfect.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"It has a lot of flaws, but the cinematography and Orson Welles' amazing performance--one of the very best I've ever seen, are enough for me to give it a perfect score anyways."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Hollywood doesn't make films like this anymore because it doesn't produce directors like Orson Welles anymore. Hollywood is dead, but then again, unfortunately so is Welles."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Masterful direction. The king of the B-movies. Plus Charlton Heston as a Mexican!
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Saw the longer, 1998-release version of this (the one Welles intended), and it's fantastic."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Incredible...one of the most suspenseful openings to a movie ever.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,I'm not sure which is better: Orson Welles's performance or his direction.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Oavsett vad Orson Welles ""egentligen"" ville g√∂ra s√• √§r det h√§r hans b√§sta film. M√∂rk, svettig och r√• sl√•r den ner som en bomb i vilken filmsoffa som helst."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Better than Citizen Kane? Yes. Obviously. Duh. Why? Where else can you get Heston speaking 'mexican' and with that fantastic fake tan? Janet Leigh being menaced by lesbian bikers? Orson Welles in the greatest fat suit of all time? Dennis Weaver. DENNIS WEAVER.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Have you hear? Welles makes some amazing films. This is one of them.

1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"My introduction to Orson Welles, and it couldn't have been a better one.

1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Every bit as good Citizen Kane or The Trial. In fact, it's probably more visually interesting than Kane, though the material is trashier and has a bit less depth."

1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Suspenseful film noir with superb work from Heston, Welles and Leigh."

1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,This film is the real McCoy
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Charlton Heston is a mexican? goes to show how insensative hollywood was back then. But that didn't stop me from liking this movie. An impressive thriller by the great Orson Welles.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Kane was amazing. Ambersons was brilliant, but this is Welles finest film."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Film noir at its darkest. Great opening crane shot. One of Welles best performances. The rest of the outstanding cast also turn in excellent performances.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"While this Welles picture didn't have quite the historical impact of Citizen Kane, for my dollar it's just as entertaining. I still marvel at the technical prowess displayed in that opening sequence."

1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"The end of classical noir era and another example of Welles' genius, I must say. Needs to be seen as words can hardly describe. After opening scene/shot, you will realize (or not), what you are dealing with."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Absolute masterpiece. My pick over Citizen Cane.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,An excellent suspense film!
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,By far the greatest thing that Orson Welles has ever done.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"An American Classic, an under-watched film, its got its flaws, but every good film does, like thee supporting cast is a little weak. But over all a great film."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"I'd read about that opening tracking shot, and it really was possibly the most incredible shot ever."

1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Really an excellent film, everything from the acting to directing is great, especially since Orson Welles' directing, writing, and performance that blows your mind! Then the six or so minute long shot, come on now, fuckin' amazing."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Best cinematography ever?
0.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"This was an extremely disappointing movie. Uncle Chuck, Janet Leigh, Orson Welles, you'd think it'd be a surefire thing, but damn, it was just boring and bleah."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Note the continuous opening shot that follows the protagonists out of the building, into their car, and around an entire city block in one uncut shot at the beginning of the film. Welles used a crane mounted on a building's roof to accomplish this."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Orson Welles is fucking brilliant

1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,All of Orson Welles' movies should default to 5 stars.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Not only is this film brilliant on all counts, it's also reason number 2 why Dennis Weaver is one of the all-time underrated acting talents."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Un pur chef-d'oeuvre : le film noir absolu que transcende une mise en scene de genie. La scene du viol vaut largement celle de la douche dans Psychose.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"maybe 2nd best Welles, and yes with Chuck Heston as a Mexican"
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"The opening shot alone is worth buying the movie. Maybe it's a better movie than Citizen Kane, maybe not... apples and oranges. I will say it is probably the best film noir ever made... even with Charlton Heston playing a mexican."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,I still can't believe that's Orson Welles..
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,*the* film noir classic
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Touch of Evil is more impressive than Citizen Kane. His use of the camera instills the perverseness of the story and the characters. The best of film noir.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,best starting plan for a movie. ever. (was for a long time a record: 20 minutes without cut). a masterpiece.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"A very good 'film noir' film with excellent direction and a commanding performance from Welles, its only real flaw is Charlton Heston is cinema's least convincing Mexican."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Only Welles could take a trashy pulp novel and turn it into a piece of art. Genius. And just listen to that dialogue: ""You framed that boy - framed him!"" Classic."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Orson Welles' other best movie.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"For me this film and Citizen Kane stand almost side by side in movie history greatness. A well-crafted film noir of depth and mood directed seemlessly by, if not the greatest, the most important filmmaker in cinema history, Mr. Orson Welles."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,The ultimate Film Noir film. So intense it feels longer than 108 minutes. The best scenes are the beginning and the ending which is ideal for any film. A lot of fun to watch and basically flawless and perfect.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,One of Welles best. A cinematic masterpiece and arguably the last great film noir.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Another masterpiece by Orson Welles that was taken out of his hands. Here we have a murder mystery in which Charlton Heson plays a Mexican narcotics officer and Orson Welles plays a crooked investigator who will do anything to get his way. Janet Leigh is outstanding as Heston's wife.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Aside from the obvious well done writing, editing and shots way ahead of its time, I'd have to say what I enjoyed most was how fat Orson Welles was and how badly ""Mexican"" Charlton Heston looked."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"""What does it matter what people say about you?"""
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,A brilliant film noir. Perhaps not as ground breaking as Citizen Kane but Touch of Evil certainly stands out as one of the best of its kind and once again shows just how great of a writer and director Orson Welles truly is.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"I don't care which cut you see, the original theatrical or the ""director's cut"", just see it. Charlton Heston...as a Mexican! What more could you want?"
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,One of my favorite American made films. I'm in love with Orson.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"I love the story, and I just can't enough of Orson Welles's extraordinary cinematography."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"A superlative work of genius, from its bravura opening to its low-key final shot, this works on all levels, as only truly great films can."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Classic very well thought out - great concept
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Despite a few questionable casting choices, Touch of Evil remains a technical masterpiece and a wonderful example of Welles' fecund imagination. The story starts with a bang and never lets up, perfectly balancing noir influenced abstraction with a sense of gritty reality."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Brilliant. Fast dialogue, dramatic camera angles, Italians playing Mexicans; everything you could ask for in a film."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,One of my favorite movies of all time. The end of the classic noir era as only Orson can do it.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"The late great Welles' seedy,oily B-picture.Full of cinematic touches only the big man could conjure up.Police corruption and brutality down Mexico way...the bravura opening tracking shot...the litter filled grimy streets...the menacing Mercedes Cambridge...Marlene...He vas hellava man!"
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,This movie is just fantastic! Beautiful b/w cinematography and such wonderful odd characters. Unfortunately Welles's rough cut is missing.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,My favourite Orson Welles film
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Another Welles masterpiece. An amazing feat of acting, direction, cinematography, and writing. I liked it the first time through and loved it the second time!"
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Just get past Charlton Heston's poor acting and this film is a masterpiece.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Orson Welles is a genius, as always!"
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,The opening scene goes on forever without a cut.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Truly inspirational film with magnificent acting, grossly gloomy plot, and KICK ASS cinematography way ahead of its time."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,This is one of the great noirs. The newer cut (based on Orson Welles notes) is brilliant.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"""A policeman's job is only easy in a police state."""
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,an absolute masterpiece!
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,gripping and in parts terrifying
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Brilliant....this movie tops any other crime noir film to come from the original wave of noir films. It's dark and gritty and creepy and at times surreal and hallucinatory. How Orson Welles was veritably ignored for the genius that he obviously was in his time is beyond me.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Fantastic movie. The acting is top notch and the directing is fantastic. One sub character that was great was the night porter of the hotel.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,orsen welles is awesome!
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Orson Welles at his best. Brilliant direction and cinematography - the opening scene is a masterpiece. Classic noir - just ignore that Charlton Heston is supposed to be Mexican...
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Incredible film that feels like it should have been made in the 70s or 80s with the themes discussed.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Mesmerizing camera work is the most immediate feature of this Orson Welles production. Like Citizen Kane, the heart of this story is the unraveling of a powerful figure (in this case, a police detective). This is a smart film that creates uncomfortable situations with great skill."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,In my opinion Welles best directorial display. The first sequence is the best sequence in film ever. A classic noir film with all the best elements. Superb
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"now, this is a true B&W; movie... no guessing around"
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Quite possibly my favorite film of all time, a film that often makes me cry because it is just such a monumental artisitc acheivement."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Ultimativ medrivende krimi, hvor man hele tiden bliver i tvivl om, hvem man skal holde med. Fantastisk √•bningsscene hvor kameraet i √©t langt skud f√∏lger hovedpersonens bil ved gr√¶nseovergangen indtil.."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Great film! Go watch it! Orson Welles is awesome!
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Suspend disbelief enough to allow Charlton Heston to play a Mexican detective, and you will be able to enjoy one of my all-time favorite noir thrillers. This film grabs you with its spectacular first tracking shot (filmed as one long, continuous take) and never lets go."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Pelicula de fronteras: Mexico-USA, Cielo-Infierno, Dia-Noche, Amor-Odio. El son de una pianola y el ""adios"" de la Dietrich me alcanzan para saber de q lado estoy yo. Gracias Orson por tanta magia."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Wow. A Film Noir powerhouse!
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,The opening shot in this film is one of the best I've ever seen.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,My review is based off the re-cut version. I thought it was directed brilliantly with such confidence and expertise.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Orson Welles is a filmmaking master. That is all.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"My all-time favorite Orson Welles movie. Sure, it has Charlton Heston playing a Mexican with an American accent, but otherwise it works."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Cracking good noir entertainment.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Charlton Heston plays a Mexican detective, and does a good acting job. Two feats never to be repeated in cinematic history, to my knowledge."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Very amazing movie... good for watching over and over again.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Haunting latter-day film-noir from Orson Welles, who is unquestionably one of the all-time great actors AND directors. Chartlon Heston and Janet Leigh and both surprisingly good, too."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,uggghhhhh... nana nana.

1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"The ""Citizen Kane"" of film noir. Alright, that was just dumb."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,This crazy movie is one of the milestones of noir genre!
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,The definitive film noir
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Citizen Kane or Touch of Evil. Which is a better movie? Do we ever have to decide?
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Only Orson Welles could make a masterpiece out of a film starring Charlton Heston as a Mexican cop.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,This movie shook me the first time i saw it. Not already the 60's but you are going to see some extreme sequence there. A group of junkies try to rape and give drug to a pregnant woman that after wake up in a bed with a dead man staring over her.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"A jolt to the system. This movie reminds me so much of great moments I'd seen in Repulsion or Mean Streets or Blue Velvet, except it came first."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,We'll miss you Chuck
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"the now deceased Heston as a Mexican? WHAT? but seriously, a movie that jumps into frame with a bomb being planted in a convertible truck and features a scantily clad, drugged up Janet Lee chained to bed can't be all bad....actually it's AWESOME!"
0.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,sooo shocked at how bad it was
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Spectacular. The film that ended the film noir era. I find it to be more entertaining that 'Citizen Kane', but it's not as transcendent due to genre conventions How can you go wrong with Welles in a massive fatsuit? RIP Charlton Heston."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,The director's cut is the superior edition. This is one of Welles' best films for so many reasons. Charlton Heston as a Mexican!
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Uno de los grandes policiales de la historia, y la mejor pelicula de Orson Welles en mi opinion... (me cago en ti, Ciudadano Kane). Ah, es el ultimo film noir clasico..."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,An amazing nior with possibly the best opening scene of any movie ever. Just breath taking!

1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Orson Welles is brilliant. just brilliant.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,this guy is openly the greatest genius of the last century. A modern leonardo da vinci.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,No Kane but an exciting and well executed flick with plenty of nifty cinematography and some good character
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Orson Welles at his best. Even Heston's typical overacting cannot prevent this film form being great.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Cine negro del weno, Orson Welles rules!!"
0.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,I HATE orson wells! and this is perhaps his worse story! the guy and his stories are just... disturbing. and definitely not in a good way.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Flixster describes this as the greates B movie ever made. It's actually one of the greatest movies ever made. period. This is how film noir is supposed to look.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,One of the GREATEST film noir's I have seen... And has the best tracking shot in a film until Goodfellas. Amazing cast and Charlton Heston playing a Mexican is a must see!
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"I love this movie. This movie is perhaps the best noir movie ever made. The long opening shot is a real treat. The preformances suprise. It is almost a who is who of the era. Orson Welles as the slimy, always sweaing, overweight cop is incredible."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Orsons is brilliant as usual, but maybe even more in this film...They forgot to mention Marlene Dietrich as gypsy in the cast"
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,I thought it was better than Citizen Kane?

1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,A masterpiece! Nothing more needs to be said.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Excellent from the opening long tracking shot to Marlene Dietrich's final piece of dialogue. The only low point for me is the irritating jumpy motel nightwatchman, but that is nitpicking. An enthralling, and visually superior, film noir."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Very clever film noir. Welles basically showing off his unfair talent in this one.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Proof that Welles exemplifies the height of craft. Not the best screen story ever told, but maybe one of the best-told screen stories ever."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Orson Wells and Charlton Heston....Nuff Said!!!
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,One of the best movies ever...
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"Orson Welles was so in character, I didn't recognize him for a half hour.brilliant film."
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,A stunning movie visually and accompanied by a great story. I have also never seen a Director have so much fun with his camerawork in terms of story telling and pacing. Just perfect. The acting of Welles will also haunt my dreams.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Forget all the talk of the opening tracking shot. A great film. A great film noir. Track down the un-restored cut to see the difference. Great stuff.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,unbelievable!!!! b.quain
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,"The best opening shot in movie history, I think. Defines ""noir."""

1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Dark and enticing film noir classic.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,My favorite of Orson Welles' films
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Orson Welle's best acting in any film and the epitomy of what film noir is all about. Gritty and compelling. It also has perhaps the best opening long shot of any film ever made.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Star filled and well played film even if Orson Welles had problems with Universal during production this is a masterpiece of a grim film. The ironic ending still is extremely effective.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Dirk and Dane and Nana just completely didn't like this at all. They were pretty vocal about that.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Classic conspracy twist film. Not only the best of its genre but one of the greatest films of all time.
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Took him the best part of 20 years but Welles finally makes a film that can sit alongside 'Kane' as a masterpiece!
1.0,1021749-touch_of_evil,Orson Welles got really fat in a very short amount of time.

1.0,alien,"Horror, dark tunnels, big monster, death and lots of Americans screaming, what more pleasure, can one ask for in a movie. Fearfully acted and scored with sets that are truly brilliant. Despite its age this film still sends a shiver down the spine. Nibbles: Milky Way Chocolate."

1.0,his_girl_friday,Simply one of the funniest movies ever made.
0.0,his_girl_friday,I watched this movie because it is considered one of the classic American films. His Girl Friday shows that the definition of classic needs to be reconsidered. The movie is about men's power over women through and through. How many stars? Negative 3 on a scale of 1-5.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"The back and forth dialogue, the manipulative machinations of the plot, and the birth of the unromantic comedy. The thing that's most surprising about this classic is the style with which Howard Hawks pulls it all off."

1.0,his_girl_friday,Hilarious fast paced comedy. They just don't make movies like this anymore.
1.0,his_girl_friday,It's always bothered me that Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell didn't make any other movies together.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Classic! The dialogue, the acting...all while looking effortlessly gorgeous. The old cliche that ""they don't make 'em like they used to"" is SO true. The Grant/Russell chemistry is amazing."
1.0,his_girl_friday,Great movie with lightning speed dialogue.
1.0,his_girl_friday,la mayor burla al periodismo de la historia. los dialogos son mas rapidos q disparos de Tommy Gun! Es una de las mejores comedias q he visto (si no es la mejor). Creo q solo se le compara Dr. Strangelove...
1.0,his_girl_friday,Cary Grant. Rosalind Russell. Dialogue so fast it'll make your head spin. This movie is the gold standard for screwball romantic comedies.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"There is nothing I don't like about this movie. It's funny, exciting, topical, and even a little touching. Plus, the acting is unbeatable and the liberties taken with the original play really enhance the story and make it far more interesting."
1.0,his_girl_friday,cary grant is always awesome
1.0,his_girl_friday,The thing that really makes this film pop was the chemistry and competition between Grant and Russell. Much of the film is adlibbed and was encouraged by Hawks. The best scene is when they're in the bar sitting around the table...the entire scene was shot in one take and is 90% adlib. Brilliant!
1.0,his_girl_friday,Try to keep up with the dialog in this forerunner to today's romantic comedy! The pace is pitch-perfect and Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell are divine.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"You ain't sweet on this picture show? That's a lot of hooey. I'd put my arm in a fire for this movie, up to here!"
1.0,his_girl_friday,One of my 5 favorite movie comedies of all time! Howard Hawks' brilliant direction & the snappy dialogue delivered by Cary Grant & Rosalind Russell make this a classic for the ages!

1.0,his_girl_friday,By far the funniest film from the Screwball era. Both Rosalind Russelland Cary Grant are mind blowingly funny.
1.0,his_girl_friday,The best film ever of a now extinct genre. Many have tried to revive the screwball comedy and all have failed. The perfect version of very good story.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"One of those great, razor-sharp comedies they just don't make anymore."
1.0,his_girl_friday,cary grant....howard hawks.....most badass rapid fire dialouge ever.....badass
1.0,his_girl_friday,"An witty, clever comedy that was entertaining from beginning to end."
1.0,his_girl_friday,"With characters moving at speed and brilliant dialogue being delivered at a machine gun rate, this is one of the great screwball comedies and a kick in the teeth for the many actresses such as Katharine Hepburn and Claudette Colbert who turned down the role of Hildy Johnson."
1.0,his_girl_friday,"A perfect comedy. Intelligent, cynical, rapid-fire dialogue, a uniformly excellent cast with the stars on top of their game. A stage adaptation that never feels stagey and that gives us a great battling love story to boot. Showing at the NFT as part of the Screwball Women season."
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Simple and charming. The wit crackles. Cary Grant is both debonair and absolutely hilarious, and Rosalind Russel is tough, brilliant, and vulnerable all at once."
1.0,his_girl_friday,This explains my love of newspeople. Cary Grant will be my love in heaven.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"clever, incredibly quick paced newspaper comedy about Grant trying to win back ex-wife."
1.0,his_girl_friday,Best screwball comedy ever. Grant and Russels dialogue is absolutely unbelievable it is so quick. Also Ralph Bellamy deserves a mention as the brilliant straight man to those two.
1.0,his_girl_friday,A Classic. Cary Grant is amazingly devious and Rosalind Russell is taking none of it.
1.0,his_girl_friday,really really great. witty and clever and fast. and the last half hour was so incredibly funny.

1.0,his_girl_friday,The fast-talking movie to end all fast-talking movies. It changed the face of American comedy and holds up so well it could make a killing if released today.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Howard Hawks is a God. This movie is a train. It doesn't let anything stop it up. A woman jumps out of a window and in less than thirty seconds, it returns it's machine-gun pace and witty dialogue. ...why can't I be more like Cary Grant? ...oh yeah, I'm hideous and completely lack any charm."
1.0,his_girl_friday,The best of the best.

1.0,his_girl_friday,The first 40 minutes might be the best stuff Hawks and Grant have ever done.

1.0,his_girl_friday,"If you think you talk fast, watch this movie and compare. I love this movie."
1.0,his_girl_friday,Progressive cinema in the sense that it portrays modern gender roles for both female reporters and actresses being able to keep up with the male counterparts. Also progressive in the delivery of lightning speed banter.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Best fast-talking, classic Cary Grant comedy. If you don't listen UP you'll miss half the jokes. Just classically perfect!"
1.0,his_girl_friday,Seriously one of the best movies ever made. Lois Lane's character was inspired by this movie.
1.0,his_girl_friday,Classic film with humor that holds out today.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Inventive and vexing, the former for the time, the latter because, well, then a war happened, leaving people like me sitting around holding their dorks wunnerin: where could we have gone from there?"
1.0,his_girl_friday,Nothing less than five stars explains it. A completely entertaining and engauging movie. Cary Grant steals the show as always.
1.0,his_girl_friday,Talk about fast deliveries! This insanely fast paced comedy raises the bar regarding witty scripts. Cary Grant and the beautiful Rosalind Russell. Delightful.  The grandady of Gilmore Girls (if that ever helps).
1.0,his_girl_friday,Wonderfully witty and fast-paced. Cary Grant is superb (as always) and Rosalind Russell is great as well. Great film!
1.0,his_girl_friday,Howard Hawks doing it the way he duz best. Cary Grant and Roselind russell sparkle.
1.0,his_girl_friday,You can't stop laughing!
1.0,his_girl_friday,Hawks' fast comedy is just about the sharpest film I've seen. Russell and Grant were fantastic. They were so full of energy that it could only be actors with their level of skill who could make their entertaining exchanges work.
1.0,his_girl_friday,Perfectly written and performed screwball comedy. The fastest movie ever made.
1.0,his_girl_friday,There might be two lines of dialog in the whole film that don't make me laugh.

1.0,his_girl_friday,I have rented this many times because I thought this was a great Cary Grant movie.
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Fabulously witty, Grant's most funniest performance in a lightning paced newspaper comedy. Features some of Grant's distinctive ad libs. When asked to describe his ex-wife's new fiancee, misplaces his line and instead comes up with ""Oh he looks like that film actor, Ralph Bellamy"". Classic."
1.0,his_girl_friday,fast-paced madness - Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell are fantastic. How can they talk that fast?
1.0,his_girl_friday,I think that I learned how to be a woman by watching old Rosalind Russell films. She rocks - always one scarcastic comment away from being a bitch but still so sweet!
1.0,his_girl_friday,this movie is pure fun especially if you catch the hidden jokes.
1.0,his_girl_friday,Grant and Russell are spectacular in this hit from 1940. The fast paced script and the obvious chemistry between Russell and Grant provides for a wonderful movie. A MUST for all Grant/Russell lovers!
1.0,his_girl_friday,A perfect example of it's kind. Fast witted dialogue that overlaps brilliantly just as it would do in real life. Grant & Russell have great chemistry and Hawks keeps things moving at such a pace you feel the tension build even though it is very much a comedy.

1.0,his_girl_friday,Brilliant all the way around.

1.0,his_girl_friday,i love cary grant! and fast-talking reporters!
1.0,his_girl_friday,The perfect screenplay. The dialogue has yet to be matched to this day.
1.0,his_girl_friday,Cary Grant was always at his best playing a smooth-talking rogue. This fast-paced intellectual comic masterpiece is one of his best. Rosalind Russell is his match (though much of her motivation seems sexist in this day and age).
0.0,his_girl_friday,"This movie fails to remind me that a woman only got one thing on her mind, and that is the reason for its low rating."
1.0,his_girl_friday,"Cary Grant and Howard Hawks, badass."

1.0,la_confidential,Honestly worth anyone's time to watch!

1.0,la_confidential,Great movie. The main cast is superb. Each of them develops their character brilliantly. The plot is interesting and forces you to keep your focus on what takes place.

1.0,la_confidential,"All of the actors were outstanding and I felt transported back into a time where it was thought to be much simpler, but was it really?"
1.0,la_confidential,Suffice to describe this as masterpiece for the ages. The point to pander was why the main three mail rolls id not captured the Academy√¢(TM)s attention for any accolade.
1.0,la_confidential,"Great movie overall, and for a noir piece it's possibly the best one since Chinatown, and the golden age of film noir itself. The cast is stellar, and for those of you who are fans of the videogame L.A. Noire it's practically required viewing. 5 stars."
1.0,la_confidential,One of Basinger's and Spacey's best.

1.0,la_confidential,Neo noir doesn't get any better than this film.Great screenplay and across- the- board fine performances from a cast that has no weak link.A notable;there are no sympathetic characters. Major parts are played showing all the flaws that even well-intentioned people possess.

1.0,la_confidential,Most intriguing film i've seen in a while! :)
1.0,la_confidential,EPIC is an understatement...
1.0,la_confidential,One of the greatest films ever made.
1.0,la_confidential,"One of the best movies of the 90's, and perhaps the greatest detective mystery story ever told on film. The entire cast knocks it out of the park, and the script never skips a beat, making for infinite re-watchability. A modern classic and truly brilliant noir."

1.0,la_confidential,This film is a masterpiece. One of the best crime dramas of all time. I definetly had a ball watching this. Great work all done by a masterful team of cast and crew. Director Curtis Hanson puts real effort and detail to the period and locations in his film and it shows all so effortlessly.
1.0,la_confidential,"It's all mind games for the criminal underworld of Las Angeles. Oh, and plenty of shotgun and smooth jazz by Chet Baker."
1.0,la_confidential,Unquestionably one of the best crime dramas ever laid out on the silver screen. The story features a spectacular narrative that really puts you in the middle of the era it represents. Spacey is wonderful as usual and this was a coming out of sorts for two terrific imports in Pearce and Crowe
1.0,la_confidential,Probably the greatest LA-Noir film I've watched.
1.0,la_confidential,Russell Crowe at his best.
1.0,la_confidential,great noire movie. took me to some of the classic crime movies but with a grittier under tone.
1.0,la_confidential,"Deep, meaningful, powerful, and most of all fun; Noir homages seriously don't get better than this."
1.0,la_confidential,"Started my Ellroy kick. Looking back, Confidential is pretty tame considering how horrifying the novel is, but it's a perfect novelization."
1.0,la_confidential,"I LOVE THIS MOVIE! I love because it's smart, suspenseful, and smartly written.I think this movie deserved the 1997 Academy Award for best picture."
1.0,la_confidential,"Loved every minute of it in what I now consider one of my favorite films ever. Not to mention two of some of my favorite actors, Crowe and Pearce, were in it too."
1.0,la_confidential,"The best film of 1997. It's a shame that Titanic's special effects stole the best picture Oscar from LA Confidential's tremendous story and script, not to mention top-shelf performances from a phenomenal cast."
1.0,la_confidential,"10 out of 10. Perfect script for a perfect investigative narration.With such damn good cast, everything looked so convincing.A must watch for fans of ""Crime/Investigation/Thriller"" genre."

1.0,la_confidential,"Brilliant. Acting, writing, directing. Loved everything about it."
1.0,la_confidential,"Hey, Titanic is better than this movie according to the wizards of smart in Hollywood. Uh-huh, and The Godfather Part III is superior to I & II."
1.0,la_confidential,"Every performance fits and is executed perfectly. In my opinion this film contains one the ten best scripts of the '1990s and in the same vain as Chinatown, L.A. Confidential stands out as one of the best examples of what a Neo Noir should be."

1.0,la_confidential,One of my all time favorites!
1.0,la_confidential,One of My Favourites
1.0,la_confidential,A rare gem of a film. It was robbed of the Best Picture Oscar by the inferior and very cheesy Titanic.
1.0,la_confidential,One of the best movies I have ever seen. This is a great 50's crime mystery with flawless acting. This could be one of Crowe's best roles as he nails the troubled cop perfectly. If you pay attention to this slightly complicated plot you will love it.
1.0,la_confidential,"Add it to the list of movies enhanced by Kevin Spacey's amazing acting abilities, and the list of great cop movies."
1.0,la_confidential,I know I'm late but I have never watched it from start to finish. What happened to these types of films uh.
1.0,la_confidential,"i love this film, great acting, great script. and im a sucker for a good mystery"

1.0,la_confidential,I absolutely love it. It's thrilling and dramatic throughout and the acting is first-rate. Definitely deserved more Oscars. The only thing I wonder is the exact importance of Basinger's character. She certainly doesn't seem pivotal to the plot...
1.0,la_confidential,"This should have been 1997's movie of the year. Cameron's ""The Titanic"", in comparison, is just a sinking ship."
1.0,la_confidential,Definitely one of the best detective stories ever made.
1.0,la_confidential,"Violent, intelligent and entertaining thriller. The acting from Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce and Kim Basinger is electric, and the 50s setting is conveyed very well."

1.0,la_confidential,"An awesome mystery with an excellent cast. Crowe, Pearce, Spacy, Devito, Cromwell, & Basinger are all excellent. I understand how this movie was nominated for 9 academy awards. A very good movie I plan to watch again."
1.0,la_confidential,"A gripping story filled with more engaging characters to study than you can count, L.A. Confidential is the most versatile mystery around. It contains something to keep everyone entertained, and its depth allows for it to easily be enjoyed through multiple viewings."

1.0,the_dark_knight,Favorite movie of all time.
1.0,the_dark_knight,"Awesome movie. Some elements of the plot were confusing at first, however, but maybe that's because I'm not a hardcore Batman fan (like how Batman knew which cops were crooked at the hospital, until afterwards).

1.0,army_of_shadows,"This is not a film, this is a remorseless testimony. 'army of shadows' will mark you like (very) few films. Never did I see such a cold-blooded way to shoot a film, and never did I see such unbearable tension. No one but Kessel could have written it, and no one but Melville have directed it I guess."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Melville captured me with his long study of characters. These characters are freedom fighters in the resistance during WWII. The audience cannot help but be impressed by the conviction in these fighters. I want to see it again.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"ARMY OF SHADOWS is one of the greatest war films I've ever seen. It is a melancholy, deep and honest depiction of desperate people in a dark period of history. Riveting all the way through, this is an indisputable masterpiece from the great French filmmaker Jean-Pierre Melville."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"As of today, Army of Shadows is the greatest film I've ever seen. Never have I been as paralyzed as I was by a film's greatness. Genius flows in every frame."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"One of the great films about the French resistance, Army of Shadows was not well thought of when it was first released in 1969, but is now thought of as one of Melville's greatest films. Riveting."
1.0,army_of_shadows,One of the best movies I've seen in a long time.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"An engrossing, brutally frank story of bleak isolation and paranoid dread. A heartbreaking masterpiece."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"A work of precision, Army of Shadows while ill paced, is a profoundly philosophical investigation of humanity, morality and bravery."
1.0,army_of_shadows,as good as it gets as a portrait of courage and an anti-faschist polemic
1.0,army_of_shadows,my favorite french film
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Army of Shadows is a dark, harrowing & brutal depiction of the French Resistance with unforgettable scenes of heroism & danger."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Beautifully shot, gloriously atmospheric, and meticulously gripping. A rich film about the underground French Resistance during WWII. I'd rank it up with ""Battle for Algiers,"" ""Z,"" and ""The Manchurian Candidate"" for great political thrillers."
1.0,army_of_shadows,All I can say is wow.
1.0,army_of_shadows,One of the best war films you're likely to find.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"A film to be watched like wine is to be drank. Saviour this for all its subtleties, nuances and textures... it is so rich. Go slow and have patience."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Best film about any Resistance movement I have seen in a long time.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Slow movie but a great one about the french resistance.
0.0,army_of_shadows,Not something Id watch more then once
1.0,army_of_shadows,The best movie I've ever seen. No other movie has ever made me feel the amount of tension that Army of Shadows has. As close as anyone could ever get to being a member of the French Resistance.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Encore un classique !
1.0,army_of_shadows,Supremely realistic film that gets under your skin and stays with you long after the credits have rolled. One of the masterpieces of French Cinema and one of the best films I've ever seen. 9.5/10
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Melville is known more for his ""Le Doulos"" and ""Le Samourai"" but this brilliant film focussing on the French resistance is a rare piece of Cinematic genius.Multi layered,suspenseful,realistic and ultimately cynical,this is a keeper."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"For some strange reason this film was either banned or never shown in the US until recently. A powerful yet bleak view of so called heroism during WWII. You could even leave the cinema with a doubt about who are in the right in any war when it comes to torture, abuse and murder. Gripping stuff."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Wonderfully complex take on the French resistance. All drama is quiet, and while there is suspense, a good bit of it is generated by moral dilemmas and the lengths to which ""heroes"" must go during wartime."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"The price of espionage troops.Ventura,Signoret,Meurisse,the all-star cast of Melville was ready to drum the front-line of A-class film-making,of which the remains of it some decades later are distant echoes,entangled subplots,why...I'll admit only Hitler was missing!"
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Not so much a war movie as a movie about ordinary people doing what they can do, even if it appears futile. The performances are all outstanding and the colour of this movie (or at least the exemplary Criterion Collection edition) is so beautiful it remains with you for days."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Un film cr√É¬©pusculaire qui donnent √É¬† r√É¬©fl√É¬©chir sur le vrai visage de la r√É¬©sistance.

1.0,army_of_shadows,"Brilliant film! one of the darkest eras in history, done with grace and subtle humor. Obvious to see that many directors today have aspires to do what Melville achieved in this masterpiece."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Outstanding film. Superb. The cinematography is excellent and the mood is intense. See this.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"The French resistance in WWII are shown here in a very different way to any other depiction I have seen. The film is very bleak - the colours, the sound, the course of events. Absolutely brilliant."
1.0,army_of_shadows,one of the bleakest films i have ever seen. the cinematography and pacing of the film are so masterful!
1.0,army_of_shadows,"A parody on the tv series 'Allo, 'Allo."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"great film!I do not care for most war films, but this film I loved! meville's texture always gets my attention."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Melville's best non-crime film... then again, it's about underground resistance fighters in ww2 so it kind of is, and it has that dirty, cold feel that all Melville pictures have so well. It's really amazing, if long, and anyone interested in something from France on the subject should see it."
1.0,army_of_shadows,The best foreign language film I have ever seen after Das Boot. Masterpiece on all levels
1.0,army_of_shadows,A spy suspense thriller classic. Rich on not just entertainment level but also character development level. Intense and emotionally powerful.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Melville explores morality, rebellion and emotion amidst the Nazi occupation in France."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"One of the most challenging and beautiful films I have ever witnessed. Army of Shadows is a deep and complex study of Humanity in its darkest times, and all the greatness and horror that can come from it. Melville's masterful direction adds art and atmosphere to every frame."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"The struggles of the French in WWII, are finally given their due. Watch these cheese eating surrender monkeys deal with problems you could never imagine and make the decisions you aren't prepared to make. And such a pretty package too!"
1.0,army_of_shadows,Great resistance film. Best Melville film in my opinion.
1.0,army_of_shadows,None is fair in love and war.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Melville's best picture. It provides an emotional context for the rest of his work.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Un film impressionnante, comme tout chez Melville."
1.0,army_of_shadows,A film about the French Resistance that you will never forget.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Creative and amazing pacing, inspiring characters and inspired acting, strong and suspenseful story ... it's best war film I've ever seen and among the top films I've watched to date in years of moving watching. The antithesis of the American block buster."
1.0,army_of_shadows,insightful and humane look at the french resistance during WW2 - not miss!
1.0,army_of_shadows,Love this film. Reminded me so much of Munich that I can't help but think Spielberg ripped the look and feel of this movie off.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Absolutely brilliant. Puts his other films in a new perspective.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Simone Signoret at her best ...

1.0,army_of_shadows,I love a film that doesn't flinch and requires the same of its viewers. Brilliantly understated!
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Tremendous! Lino Ventura is a presence to be seen and seen again. Paul Meurisse and Simone Signoret together after ""Les Diaboliques"" is great! Melville's greatest film! Although just as great as ""Le Samourai"" or ""The Silence of the Sea."""
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Absolutely fantastic; utterly captivating. Great acting plus lots of tension and suspense. It's hard to believe this film didn't make it our for 37 years! It's long, but it doesn't feel like it -- I didn't want it to end."
1.0,army_of_shadows,After two days I'm still at a loss for words. All I can say is this: that was a friggin' journey.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Harrowing account of being in the French Resistance. Will resonate long after you've finished watching it, like years after you've finished watching it."
1.0,army_of_shadows,The problem with watching this movie is that you never get to watch it again for the first time.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Amazing! They sure don't make them like they used to. The film has been in the shadows for too long, this should be up there in the top 50 films of all time."

1.0,army_of_shadows,Epoch and extraordinary.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Beautiful film about friendship, brotherhood, patriotism and sacrifice. Army of Shadows shows the struggle of the French Resistence during the Second World War."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"So good. The fact that this came out just two years ago is a shame. Easily the best Melville work and a contender for best French film of the sixties, Army of Shadows shows us the fallout from the war on France, and the devastating tolls it exacts from its citizens."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"A wonderful masterpiece presenting the early days of the French resistance. Melville's direction is flawless, weaving scenes of great atmosphere and tension. To think it was almost lost forever makes its restoration incredible."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"This film is pretty amazing. its a film about the french resistance, during the German takeover of France. it may move a bit slowly, but it is a great thriller."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Proabably top three best all around movies i've ever seen. Very influencial to both Francis Ford Coppola and Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. Gripping and suspenseful through and through.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Classic.Ventura is just perfect. Dark, intense and really sad."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"melville never ceases to amaze. i'm no expert on art/film about the resistance, but this has to be one of the best. ventura is amazing."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Absolutely amazing and effecting view of World War II. Fully recommended.
1.0,army_of_shadows,This is a striking and beautiful film. Flawless. The ending was perfect. Very impressive. It is one of my favorites.
1.0,army_of_shadows,this is one of the most flawless movies ever made. it has that cold mechanical brilliance that made melville's le samourai the most flawless movie i thought ever made before i saw this one.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"This is not a film about the war, this is about humanity."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Thankyou to Criterion for introducing me to this film. It totally blew me away. Melville creates a mood unlike any I've experienced.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Melville had his shit together. I still prefer Le Samorai.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Best. War Film. Ever.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Excellent, excellent film"
1.0,army_of_shadows,Melville was a cinematic genius.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"An amazing film. Subtle at times in the violence, but direct in others, you can feel the tension, desperation and dedication to the greater cause, even when their formal training and discipline (or lack thereof) leads to the hardest decisions."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Remarkable in every way. A must see+++++
1.0,army_of_shadows,"A wonderful movie that turns the duel between good and evil into a struggle for survival and were heroes are forced to behave like gangsters. The coldness of the actors and of the light gives the impression that each character carries death on his shoulder, others' and his."
1.0,army_of_shadows,A masterpiece! An absolute must!
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Another late 60s masterpiece by Melville, no less a ""cool"" existential tragedy than Le Samourai or Le Cercle Rouge."
1.0,army_of_shadows,The greatest French resistance film finally is released in the states.
1.0,army_of_shadows,C'est juste le meilleur film fran√É¬ßais de l'histoire du cinema ...
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Perhaps Melville's greatest. Made in 69, it ended up being hands-down the greatest film of 2006 (when it was finally shown on the big screen in the US). This is the sort of ""war"" film Spielberg's tiny brain cannot even dream of cooking up"
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Excellent and depressing film about those who fought in secret against insurmountable odds, never to see the fruit of their labors. Also includes a rare documentary on the bonus disc with the footage of the last days of combat between civilians and nazi troops on the streets of Paris."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"The criterion cover is much better than this poster, btw! The most magisterial, and fully developed of all of Melville's films, it is a beautiful and poignant film which not only witnesses to the particularities of the time it covers, but touches upon the perennially human."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Melville, bien sur, le seul √É¬† pouvoir r√É¬©aliser un film comme celui l√É¬†. Magistralement interpr√É¬©t√É¬© par l'ensemble des acteurs."
1.0,army_of_shadows,It is all to telling that today in 2007 This film is more relevant ever.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Un film d'une rare intensit√É¬©. Tout y est glac√É¬©, comme la p√É¬©riode durant laquelle l'action prend place. Sans doute une des oeuvres les plus impressionnantes sur la r√É¬©sistance, sa violence comme mal n√É¬©cessaire."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Top du top Melville.
1.0,army_of_shadows,every one MUST see this movie. It's awesome and so powerful
1.0,army_of_shadows,masterpiece. Signoret is unique
1.0,army_of_shadows,LE film sur la R√É¬©sistance.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"The best film I've seen in the last year, this is a virtual masterpiece. The pace, the settings, and the acting are all superb."
1.0,army_of_shadows,This was the best film I saw all year.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Puisqu'il est question d'√É¬©difier les lyc√É¬©ens... Peut-√É¬™tre pourrait-on leur projeter cette oeuvre? Sans esbroufe.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Contains one of the best constructed scenes of intensity and desparation ever captured. Wholly engrossing.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Beautiful movie. Melville has done a wonderful job showing hope, when there is little or no hope to be found."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Days in the life of the French resistance. Uncompromising and unsentimental; Jean-Pierre Melville's finest film. Lino Ventura's face speaks louder about the dehumanizing force of war than just about anything else in all of cinema.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"The one thing I would change: iIwould put the opening scene back at the end of the movie, where it originally belonged. Other than that, I can't think of a flaw in it."
1.0,army_of_shadows,A French film not obsessed with fashion; who thought it possible?
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Wicked movie by a master of french cinema, Melville takes the french resistance and brings them to life in this harrowing tale of desperation during WW 2"
1.0,army_of_shadows,Incredibly rewarding.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Every frame of this movie deserves to be matted and hung on your wall, and the fact that you haven't done this makes you a worse person. The color, the shots, the mise en scene, the acting - this is marvelous."
1.0,army_of_shadows,This is probably my favorite movie ever. Jean-Pierre Melville is the master of this genre and gangster films and this is the truest film adaptation of the french resistance ever made.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Great melancholic and unsentimental - the resistance portrayed like sympathetic gangsters doing a difficul and terrible job.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Okay so it's basically the only film I've seen on the Resistance, but I don't doubt that it's one of the best as well."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Incredible French movie from the 70s set during WWII about the Resistance. Super-intense and gritty. Look-out for the parachute jump scene.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"A flick about the French Resistance, but in the style of a film noir. Not really much like a war movie, though... reminded me a lot of Brazil, or 1984... of brave, doomed heroes in their lonely struggle against hopeless odds."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Standing ovation. The Cahiers du Cinema had it all wrong, a rare mistake from the masters of the New Wave. Lino Ventura gives one of the greatest performances in film history. Too bad Melville wasn't around to see the reception the film has received in its 2006 North American release."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Ce que signifient patriotisme et sacrifice dans un pays d√É¬©poss√É¬©d√É¬© de son √É¬¢me par l'occupation. Un chef d'oeuvre qui montre ce qu'il y avait derri√É¬®re le mot ""r√É¬©sistance"", aujourd'hui bien galvaud√É¬©e."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"The exact title for this part of french history, by one of his lead director and formal underground ""actor"" of this war..."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"One of my single favorite movies. Extra slick, super elegant (with often perfectly noticeable, low budget) cinematography that is as evocative as the storyline: frumpy, sweet dude is actually a resistance fighter and down-and-dirty killer. A meaty opus from the French cowboy Melville."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Yet another great Jean-Pierre Melville flick
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Ce film doit √™tre vu , c'est tout..."
1.0,army_of_shadows,My favorite movie regarding WWII in Europe/occupied France. Almost unbearably tense at moments; definitely not for the sentimental.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Melville has become one of my favorite directors. I have only seen this and Le Samourai but there are no other movies like them. His style is so cool and perfect. I need to see more of his movies.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"This movie grabbed me and threw me into the French resistance along with the other characters. Leaving me feeling just as desperate and hopeless as the others, but still making me never stop to try and change it all and make a difference, even if it means dying for the cause."
1.0,army_of_shadows,It's hard to watch this film without gasping at the exquisite cinematography and top-notch acting.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Amazing and subtle. Exposing the true duality faced by people during wartime.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Absolutely incredible narrative that doesn't show you heroes in resisting the Nazis but explores the moral difficulty they often faced and asks if it was really worth it. The way the characters are presented simply and matter of factly makes this an absolute joy to watch.
1.0,army_of_shadows,The most perfect french resistance film ever.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Brilliant pacing. Brilliant acting. Look for color and use of camera as expression of message through technique. Melville does it all here. The depth of this political-thriller is one you'd seldom find in a genre often filled with little else beyond escapist aspirations and action/chase sequences.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"One of the best WWII films i've ever seen, incrediblely real and tragic."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"I really wish more directors could synthesize Melville (and Renoir)'s mix of realism and humanism. One of the great, great films of our time."
1.0,army_of_shadows,I'm really becoming a Meville fan. This movie has aged extremely well.
1.0,army_of_shadows,One of my favorite symbols: the Fallen Hat.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"A sad reflective film by Melville, dealing with the French resistance of Nazi Occupied France. Powerful and extremely moody. Has the dark somber feeling of his late films."
1.0,army_of_shadows,The French Resistance reimagined as a gangster movie!
1.0,army_of_shadows,Le plus grand film fran√ßais de tous les temps.
1.0,army_of_shadows,definitely effective. melville adds his personal experiences to the movie and creates this emotionally effective masterpiece movie that nicely avoids the traps of cliches.
1.0,army_of_shadows,A highly emotive and beautiful film. Artfully capturing the fear and tension felt by the French Resistance during WWII. Brutal and highly effective.
1.0,army_of_shadows,A perfect film from 1969. Why is it being listed as a 2006 release just because the yanks were a bit slow off the blocks? Amateurs the lot of ye!
1.0,army_of_shadows,probably my favorite movie.
1.0,army_of_shadows,A true classic! Everything about it reeks of brilliance.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Wow... no words for this...
1.0,army_of_shadows,Best movie i have ever seen
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Bleak, extraordinary, masterful: inexplicable why it wasn't released here for forty years."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Stunning, magisterial cloak and dagger drama about the inner workings of the French Resistance during WWII. Fascinating and endlessly engrossing, this lost masterpiece by Jean-Pierre Melville is one for the ages."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"A masterpiece that focuses on the real heroes of WWII, the resistance leaders. A landmark in French Cinema that shoulda been released back in the 60's as opposed to 2006."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Wow, best French resistance movie ever. I cried at the end."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Best film of '06, made in '69.Now this masterpiece is finally released in the U.S."
1.0,army_of_shadows,great great film about the French Resistance.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Sans doute le meilleur film sur la resistance...
1.0,army_of_shadows,Melville's film is flawlessly executed. Slow deliberate pacing unveils a full bodied portrait of resistance against an insurmountable foe. The viewer will be moved and perturbed at the film's slightest suggestions.
1.0,army_of_shadows,So powerfull so strong so tough
1.0,army_of_shadows,Resistance fights as dressed-to-the-nines gangsters.. Melville at his best. A classic.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Simone Signoret puts the icing on a perfect cake.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Incredible portrat of the French Resistance. Maybe be Melville's best.""His confidence restrains me more than any shackles."""
1.0,army_of_shadows,The best movie of 2006! (but it just so happens to have been made 40 years ago). May give an indication of the progression cinema has made.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Bleak, tense and mind-blowing. Melville's best possibly?"
1.0,army_of_shadows,"The fact that 26% of people want to see this and 74% are not interested proves my theory that at least 3/4 of the population is dumb as rocks. You're the same people who voted for Bush a second time, aren't you? Terrorists."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Heartbreaking. Beautiful. Flawless.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"A movies about the French Resistance by a man who was a part of the French Resistance. There's an invaluable amount of style in this film, also it's obviously very personal, so it's one of the best movies you'll ever watch."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Sad to think it took about 40 something years for this thing to finally come out over here. It's one of the best movies you can ever see.
1.0,army_of_shadows,What an exquisite film. Such implosive performances by Lino Ventura and Simone Signoret. A truly inspiring film of such beautful sadness.
1.0,army_of_shadows,This movie rocked me.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Simply amazing. One of the most suspenseful movies I've ever seen but it's intensity comes from the smallest things like leaving a train knowing that if security searches you, you are literally a dead man. This is a movie that I will spend the rest of my life harassing my friends to see."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Melville at his best.
1.0,army_of_shadows,Best film of 2006? So so... so haunting....
1.0,army_of_shadows,I think a critic just summed it up best. He siad it was a great film but also one of the most upsetting films I know.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"A haunting, complex work from master director Melville. This film is dark, and certainly not for those who need some happiness in their movies. Brilliant throughout, and expertly made."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Smart as hell. All about the personal and public costs of devoting ones self to espionage and one's country. It shows how in many ways, members of the French Resistance lost their lives before they actually died."
1.0,army_of_shadows,"This movie is SOOO good but SOO sad. It's incredibly done. It has nothing like 'a hollywood ending"" (cuz its a French movie, and is in French...)"
1.0,army_of_shadows,Tense and looming. War films are much more interesting when the internal wars dominate the action.
1.0,army_of_shadows,This movie took over my life. Absolutely terrific.
1.0,army_of_shadows,A very interesting message about war. Army Of Shadows is a beautiful looking film. This is Melville's masterpiece.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Such a great, great film. This is what its all about"
1.0,army_of_shadows,Best movie I've seen in a while. Maybe Melville's best.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Probably the best movie I've ever seen in a theater. Besids the general cinematic brilliance, it manages to empathize with the characters while NOT heroizing them. If anything the film shows that, in war, everyone is a villain."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Absolutely brilliant.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"Easily within my top five. Bleak, unflinching."
1.0,army_of_shadows,Brilliant on every level.
1.0,army_of_shadows,The machine gun execution is one of the tensest moments evere captured on film.
1.0,army_of_shadows,"""And now a short detour."" Nothing will make you support resistance to tyranny like this look at the French Resistance."

1.0,cool_hand_luke,Cool Hand Luke is heightened by a masterful screenplay and one of Paul Newman's most unforgettable performances.
1.0,cool_hand_luke,"Paul Newman carries this pcture in classic style. Its not that the rest of the cast, or the writing or the directing are bad or anything. Far from it. Its just that Paul Newman does so well in this role that the viewer will come away reeling from his performance. Its just so damn cool."
1.0,cool_hand_luke,"There are so many well known faces on display, it's unreal. This is a classic in every sense of the word. Newman should've won an Oscar for this and Kennedy did (richly deserved). I shouldn't have waited 30 years to finally check this one out."

0.0,the_wrestler,"Pitiful. Sure, a great performance but do you really want to spend two hours watching bloody violence and a man's life falling apart with no true happy ending. The reward mentioned in the critics' consensus is that the suffering is finally over when the movie ends."

1.0,the_wrestler,One of the best movies of the 2000's.
1.0,the_wrestler,One of the best character dramas of the last decade. I was totally absorbed into the lives of these characters. Rourke and Tomei are in top form in a movie that has the feel of something we'd have seen in the early 70's.

1.0,the_wrestler,most see for any wrestling fans!
1.0,the_wrestler,"The Wrestler proves that simple can be beautiful. Mickey Rourke's heart-wrenching performance reaches out to audiences and pulls them into the most sympathetic situations. If Randy ""the Ram"" Robinson isn't pitiful, then our audiences need some emotional work. Darren Aronofsky at his best."

1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,"STELLAr performance from Marlon Brando playing a psychotic alpha-male. I've only seen the director's cut of this movie, which is just a few minutes longer, so I can only imagine what a disservice the censors did to 1951 audiences by forcing Kazan to release a sanitized version of this film."
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,Hahaha. No consensus yet on Streetcar? Let's go ahead and agree on one. It's one of the best movies of all-time. Brilliantly written. Brilliantly directed. Brilliantly acted. It is the beginning of Brando's takeover of Hollywood as the best film actor of all-time.

1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,Top notch performances but the entire cast. Brando is electrifying as Stanley Kowalski. Vivien Leigh gives one of the great performances in cinema as the mentally unstable Blanche DuBois.
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,Boring chick flick. 1950s Lifetime television bullshit.And Tennessee Williams? Could you possibly have a more pretentious name? God! Wasting my time with these stupid black and white movies.

1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,"It's a dynamite explosion when a brutish, heartless man gets caught up in the life of an emotionally disturbed, incurably romantic, sensitive teacher. Brando and Leigh give epic unforgettable performances, aided by that quintessential supporting actor Malden in this tragic masterpiece."
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,Wow! How did this ever make it out in the fifties? The enforced modesty of the period only makes the film sleazier and sexier than ever. Could a producer do as good a job today?
1.0,1020333-streetcar_named_desire,"""A movie named Desire"" in my opinion. This one is one of those movies that you can watch over and over again. So, ""Stella! Come and watch this movie with me.

1.0,the_conformist,A movie that makes me remember why cinema is art.
1.0,the_conformist,"The Conformist is one of the most beautiful visions of life ever recorded on film, displaying Italy's architecture as monuments surrounded by tableau."
1.0,the_conformist,The ending. The very last scene in the movie. That look he gives without saying anything at all says everything about his character outline throughout the entire movie. I'm blown away.
1.0,the_conformist,"The Conformist is commendable for its lavish production and masterful photography, certainly, but where the brilliance lies is in its portrayal of a man who is in a constant struggle with not only his political affiliations, but with his marriage, his sexuality, and his life."
1.0,the_conformist,"Exquisite, poignant, and extremely alluring."
1.0,the_conformist,"Another take on the banality of evil, through the cowardice and desire for conformity even though he is aware things outside of such conformity. An entirely visual rumination on life, but difficult if to follow narratively."
1.0,the_conformist,The title says it all.
1.0,the_conformist,??...????????????...???????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
1.0,the_conformist,A must see film. Bertolucci is completely at ease and this is where it all starts.
1.0,the_conformist,"'Animula vagula blandula Hospes comesque corporis' (Little soul of mine, tender and soft, sweet companion of my body). Capturing Rene Magritte's surreal paintings, this film about identity portrays an unforgettable cinematic and dynamic style of beauty."
1.0,the_conformist,"One of my favourite films - a perfect cast, great cinematography, fantastic use of colour and space. Hard to beat."
1.0,the_conformist,"Far less deep than it appears to be, The Conformist is sustained by the beauty of its compositions and the elegance of its camerawork, which capture the false grandeur of fascist Italy and one man's attempt to evade its evil in order to live a ""normal"" life."
1.0,the_conformist,"Dialogues, performances, cinematography, soundtrack: everything works perfectly and creates a tense atmosphere that helps the film to become one of Bertolucci's great masterpieces."

1.0,the_conformist,So contemporary so beautiful.
1.0,the_conformist,"Simplesmente uma obra prima. Meio que uma mistura de noir com arthouse.. Puta que me pariu, visualmente lindo , atua√É¬ß√É¬µes perfeitas (destaque pra Dominique Sanda que alem de atuar bem, pqp que mulher..) de primeira pode at√É (C) parecer um pouco confuso, mas nada de mais.. recomendad√É¬≠ssimo."
1.0,the_conformist,"Gorgeous, possibly the best-looking movie ever made. Also some jaw-dropping direction and acting, and a huge story which is ultimately a bit too sprawling. But a must-see movie for anyone who loves movies."
1.0,the_conformist,"I could wach this movie without any sound, as it is such a great exercise in style. Bertolucci's masterpiece as far as I am concerned, and a sad reminder that the guy hasn't made anything approaching this level since the mid-70s. Resting on your laurels there, Bernardo?"

1.0,the_conformist,"One of the greatest movies ever. Has such a powerful theme of having to conform to ones society, obviously if you look at the title. Amazing cinematography, acting, directing and writing. This really struck a chord in me after watching it. Also one of the best endings ever."
1.0,the_conformist,A fantastic film about Italian fascism and beautifully shot as well.

1.0,the_conformist,Italian Cinema at its best
1.0,the_conformist,"THe film that annced a new master of cinema in the form of Bernardo Bertolucci... Before the REvolution was fine, 'Partner' was weird, but htis is the real McCoy. Stylistically brilliant, chic, immaculately acted and entirely memorable."
1.0,the_conformist,A masterpiece - Bertolucci's film addresses issues of self-betrayal and repression in a movie way ahead of it's time. The beauty of the film remains intact after nearly forty years.
1.0,the_conformist,"A terrifying picture of a person who commits atrocities by allowing others around him to take the actions. The acting is brilliant.

1.0,the_conformist,"A perfect existentialist film with a double-edged finale, enveloped in Plato's fable of the Cave. It builds slowly and steadily to the most devastating final fifteen minutes of a film anyone is likely to see - if you like novels like The Pigeon and The Tenant, see this at once."
1.0,the_conformist,Sick film. Great cinematography. Top notch acting. I love it. The assassination scene in the forest is one of the most brutal scenes you're ever likely to see. The two main actresses are super hot. This is never a bad thing.
1.0,the_conformist,"There is no doubting. This is an incredible film. The editing, performances, mise-en-scene, music -- particularly the way the framing isolates the conformist against the colour, movement and lighting of other objects."
1.0,the_conformist,bertollucci has done an unlinear story-telling from 1970!! what a great movie...
1.0,the_conformist,"Well-observed relationships, gorgeous photography. I'd like to see this again and again."
1.0,the_conformist,"A beautiful film, the most stylish of all. Bertolucci's drama focuses on intrigue, sex, and politics. Trintignant is a european Bogart."
1.0,the_conformist,Bertolucci's absolute masterpiece....
1.0,the_conformist,one of the most amazing pieces of art i've seen.
1.0,the_conformist,"The possible influence of Foucault in examining what normalcy is, might be, should be, could be makes for a great character study."
1.0,the_conformist,I doubt it is still possible to make a film like that...
1.0,the_conformist,I saw this about thirty times when I was 20. It has all kinds of subtexts that subvert the original storyline from the novel as well as the overt intentions of the director. Drenchingly beautiful with one of the finest movie scores ever.
1.0,the_conformist,"My favorite scene is Marcello Clerici's visit to his father in classical Roman bedlam. No, it's Giulia's dance in the apartment."
1.0,the_conformist,"Brilliant! Probably Bertolucci's best. We are taken into the heart of a shallow man. Should be inane, but it's gripping. Trintignant is riveting. The photography is magnificent. Master film making."
1.0,the_conformist,"the best foreign language film ever made. beautiful cinematography, classic use of light from the masters Bertolluci & Vittorio Storaro"
1.0,the_conformist,"LOOOOVED IT. Stylishly filmed, beautifully put together, all the characters are fantasticly written, it might even jump to a ***** after a rewatch. -Done ;)- Just see it."
1.0,the_conformist,The greatest cinematography of all time boosts a great film into the pantheon of the greatest films. Bertolucci created a great film that had a huge influence on The Godfather.
1.0,the_conformist,"Between Scarfiotti's art design, Delerue's period score, Storaro's lenses and Bertolucci's emerging operatic style, AND the beauty of Dominique Sanda and a young Trignitant juxtaposed against the spineless cruelty of fascist minds, it does not get better than this film classic."
1.0,the_conformist,[i]Review coming soon.[/i]

1.0,the_conformist,The mind's eye boggles
1.0,the_conformist,"Beautiful film about a sheep in wolves clothing. It occasionally overstretches itself in the style department and the metaphor with Plato's cave is pretentious, but is thought-provoking and brave in depicting the choices made in the rarely discussed (internally, anyway) fascist-era Italy."
1.0,the_conformist,"this movie is a combination of: some of the best use of light and shadow ever seen on film and an enormously engrossing story with extremely compelling characters. In other words, it is one of cinema's best."

1.0,the_conformist,Brilliant beautiful movie that must be seen in a movie theater to be fully appreciated.
1.0,the_conformist,"Visually stunning. It's rare when I finish a movie and want to immediately start it up again. Call it a short attention span or a continuing thirst for new stimulation, but either way, I needed to back and rewatch some."
1.0,the_conformist,Exceptional. Storaros photography is magnificent.
1.0,the_conformist,"bravo bertolucci, and with out Brando or naked French teenagers (disappointedly of course), bravo."
1.0,the_conformist,"i've never seen anything quite like this film. The marriage of story, camera, character and theme make it overpowering every time i watch it. So many virtually perfect scenes...the chase music...the swirling leaves...train sex...black/white, confession, the asylum..."

1.0,the_conformist,Most beautiful Film to date. I remember the first time I watched it on a big screen. I couldn't believe my eyes.
1.0,the_conformist,Un des films importants de ma vie. Une adaptation d'un roman de Moravia avec en toile de fond l'Allegorie de la caverne de Platon et en prime la tres charmante Dominique Sanda. Je voulais faire ma maitrise en litterature sur Bertolluci... J'y ai decouvert Platon et Georges Leroux.
1.0,the_conformist,Stunningly enchanting cinematography with so many layers in the story line that you can watch again and read new meaning
1.0,the_conformist,"The ""anti-realism"" of Bertolucci + Alberto Moravia's novel on Fascism and sexual repression = beautiful."

1.0,the_conformist,"bizarrely, if you've ever seen it, the movie I based my first student film on. Thank god Criterion released it on DVD - now I can toss my awful DVD dubs of crappy VHS dubs of a long unavailable laserdisc edition... Maybe the best film Bertolucci ever made"
1.0,the_conformist,Fantastic cinematography.
1.0,the_conformist,A sumptuous film that not enough people know about. Its credit is much overdue.

1.0,the_conformist,"Every scene is filled with beautiful cinematography, intense dialogue and unforgettable expressions."
1.0,the_conformist,Bertolucci at his best!
0.0,the_conformist,bad movie. Highly overrated.
1.0,the_conformist,This is worth watching for Vittorio Storaro's outstanding cinematography alone but this is also a highly intriguing character study of a man (Jean-Louis Trintignant) who is a Fascist agent under the Mussolini regime. This is Bertolucci at his very best.
1.0,the_conformist,A masterpiece of drama/eros/noir/politics and entertaining regardless of whatever language you watch it in (but you'd better not watch it dubbed!!) Pre 'Godfather' genious
1.0,the_conformist,"Light, colour, beauty and moral decay."
1.0,the_conformist,This film is part of the reason I want to do what I do.
1.0,the_conformist,"Visual feast, one of most cinematic films ever made and one of the best films ever"
1.0,the_conformist,"Absoluely beautiful in every single way. Dramatically complex, visually stunning - it puts a total spell on you."
1.0,the_conformist,"Probably one of the most beautifully shot films I've ever seen. The use of angles, light and color is among the best I've ever seen. Not to say the plot itself is slouching, as it's a great and horrifying story of what a man will do to be accepted by society."
1.0,the_conformist,"Beautiful film. Long tracking shots, sparse dialogue. Storraro is the real star of the film."
1.0,the_conformist,"Visually brilliant, this is THE filmmaker's film. The camera seems to be a character just as much as the actors, which makes it all the more entralling..."
1.0,the_conformist,Overwhelmingly beautiful. Haunting. Tragic.
1.0,the_conformist,One of the best films ever made. Seriously.
1.0,the_conformist,A total classic that still has the power and intensity that it held when it was first made.

1.0,the_conformist,"my favourite movie, the camera work is brilliant, a must see for all movie lovers!"
1.0,the_conformist,A terrifying look at how it can be worse to allow evil to happen than to do evil yourself. Cinematography of a nearly unparalleled nature.
1.0,the_conformist,One of the best films of all time - bar none. The camera work & photography here is almost orgasmic. Brilliant.
1.0,the_conformist,a beautiful amazingly haunting film who's poignancy and meaning still retains especially in our current world
1.0,the_conformist,Storaro at his best. One of my all time favorite films.
1.0,the_conformist,"Possibly the top 3 best movies ever seen in my life. The meaningful lighitng palette, the imaginative use of tilts and trackings, and more importantly, the arrangement of subjects within the frame, in other words, arbitrary composition"
1.0,the_conformist,A film which highlights the connections between conformity and fascism. A later sequel showed the connections between the Fashion Industry and conformity. The final part of the trilogy (called Fashionism) wraps everything up neatly. Watch this film.
1.0,the_conformist,Bertolucci is a true cinematic auteur.
1.0,the_conformist,Watched it again recently. Gets better with every viewing. A director and cinematographer at the height of their respective games.
1.0,the_conformist,I watched it on the big screen. It met me expectations in every single frame. The finest cinematography I have ever seen.
1.0,the_conformist,cinematography kicks all kinds of ass. The surrealism mixed with a noir wash is breathtaking.
1.0,the_conformist,"Excellent depiction of the effect of fascism upon a unique, complex man, desperate to convince the world that he is no different than anyone else. It builds slowly, but the final fifteen minutes are truly powerful stuff."
1.0,the_conformist,Stunning direction and camera work along with excellent performances and a truly fascinating plot make this an excellent movie that can't be missed by film buffs or Bertolucci fans.
1.0,the_conformist,I don't why you would call yourself a cinematographer or a director if you didn't make an effort to watch this flick. Storaro and Bertolucci collaborating. This film really influenced me the most visually.
1.0,the_conformist,bertolucci's greatest film and like vigo he was only 29
1.0,the_conformist,"This is a masterpiece of 1970's european cinema, made when Bertolucci was still only 30. I think it is his greatest film, shot on the border crossing between dream and nightmare."
1.0,the_conformist,One of the greatest films ever.
1.0,the_conformist,One of those you have to see 2x to understand. But one of the most attractive color films ever.

None of the characters were interesting or sympathetic, they just sat around with retarded looks on their faces. And there was no emotion or atmosphere in the entire movie."
1.0,tokyo_story,Bought this movie in college when I started getting into Japanese Cinema thanks to a World Cinema course I was taking. Tokyo Story is a simple story done perfectly.
1.0,tokyo_story,Expertly and delicately crafted. Characters will remain unforgettable.
1.0,tokyo_story,A great movie.No matter how much is said it will still be less to such a great movie.Seldom such a movie comes.Long live asian cinema

The movie questions the subtle things in relationships where the children amidst their busy life forget the parents. The parents soon become an object of nuisance. A must watch movie
1.0,tokyo_story,"Very mesmerizing watch, and I sympathise a lot with the optimistic, peaceful grandparents. Maybe slightly protracted towards the end, but otherwise, at least, an amazing film. Hoping to watch more Ozu in the future."

1.0,tokyo_story,I really just wanted to cry
1.0,tokyo_story,Cinema doesn't get much better.
1.0,tokyo_story,"A tad less focused than other Ozu films. Nonetheless, it's a beautiful and deeply moving film. Chishu Ryu's performance is stunning."
1.0,tokyo_story,"""Isn't life disappointing?""

Considered by international critics to be one of the ten best movies ever made."

1.0,tokyo_story,Wonderful! They don't make 'em like this anymore...
1.0,tokyo_story,A masterpiece! The inevitable passage of time

1.0,tokyo_story,"Life may be disappointing and cruel, but Ozu leaves plenty of room for simple human beauty. This film may be quiet, but it echoes deep within one's soul."
1.0,tokyo_story,Voyage √É¬† tokyo de Ozu est un monument de l'histoire du cin√É¬©ma. C'est l'histoire d'un couple qui va voir ses enfants tr√É¬®s occup√É¬©s √É¬† Tokyo. Un film touchant sur les liens familiaux qui se distandent. Tr√É¬©s grand classique.
1.0,tokyo_story,"Yasujiro Ozu shows that a beautiful and powerfully emotional story can be told using only stationary camera shots, without losing any of it's effect. Brilliant."
1.0,tokyo_story,One of my most treasured films. Perfection.
1.0,tokyo_story,Yasujiro Ozu's most famous film is a masterpiece in mood and pace. The film is also infinitely successful in managing to tackle life affecting issues in such an understated and selfless way.
1.0,tokyo_story,A gentle and exquisite masterwork that is instructive about the constant changes in life and family relations and the resulting ambivalence that arises from it. Not surprised that it's considered to be essential viewing for any film lover.
1.0,tokyo_story,"Shot with precision and simplicity, Tokyo Story touches very deeply without appealing to great conflicts. Silence is a constant, as well as hidden feelings that the spectator can sense but not necessarily identify."
1.0,tokyo_story,"An exquisite tale, of an elderly couple navigating the geography of their relationships with their children; the visual aesthetic, and the framing which reveals subtle gestures help us understand the relationships, make this an amazing film."

1.0,tokyo_story,Freakin' masterpiece!
0.0,tokyo_story,Could not believe any of the actors here.
1.0,tokyo_story,"There's few films as patient, beautiful, and perfectly composed as 'Tokyo Story'. Its influence is still felt directly (most recently 'A Christmas Tale', and 'Yi Yi' before it), yet it still holds more power than all the imitators that have come since."
1.0,tokyo_story,One of the best dramas of all times.All current drama directors should take note.Aspiring filmmakers should also take notes on how to effectively use stationary camera.
1.0,tokyo_story,"God knows how many times I have watched this movie, and it's still as great and masterful. Ozu rules!"
1.0,tokyo_story,"""Isn't life disappointing?"""
1.0,tokyo_story,"A poignant film and well worth the praise. A film about the drift in family, how we no longer make time for each other, distracted by our own lives and the ego of our own self-importance."
1.0,tokyo_story,"One of the saddest movies ever made. Ozu is a filmmaker that, once life is experienced more, tells the truest and most saddening stories."
1.0,tokyo_story,"Masterpiece, beautiful scenario, brilliant story telling...great acting, and the message...will be always there. This movie will teach you the meaning of life and love for others. One of my favourites by far."
1.0,tokyo_story,Only Ozu I've seen.. I know what the hype is all about now.
1.0,tokyo_story,"Yasujiro Ozu's astounding parable on family is a gorgeous and gentle masterpiece. It's a world-beloved movie (with good reason) and a prime example of the life-changing power of cinema. As one critic put it, ""Like people-watching from the point of view of a god."""
1.0,tokyo_story,A towering cinematic achievement full of life-affirming humanism.
1.0,tokyo_story,My favorite Ozu. One of the saddest story told on film.
1.0,tokyo_story,Beautiful. Ozu's best.
1.0,tokyo_story,"Tokyo Monogatari was a masterpiece narration. Ozu was one of the Japanese greatest film director. Unlike Akira Kurosawa who always portray the tragedy in an epic tale, Ozu prefer to crafting the poetic side of human life. Tokyo Story was superb."
1.0,tokyo_story,"Ozu's very best film, and not just because everyone says it is. It's just a sublimely photographed, written and observed family drama. The debate about whether Ozu is slow has gone on for decades - I guess some people have trouble getting into his style, but I loved this."
1.0,tokyo_story,This is the film that started my interest in Japanese cinema. A masterpiece.
1.0,tokyo_story,simplicity made film.
1.0,tokyo_story,"This film sneaks up on you. What appears to be a basic family drama slowly shades in each character until the finale, which packs such an emotional wallop that you'll feel dazed & confused for days afterwards. By far the best film about family dynamics I've ever seen."
1.0,tokyo_story,I want to cry just thinking about it.
1.0,tokyo_story,It's just an amazing movie.
1.0,tokyo_story,"Other than maybe Hou Hsiao-hsien, no one really has the courage and talent to make movies like this. I'm embarrassed by every scene or story I've ever imagined. Movie makers should be ashamed of themselves."
1.0,tokyo_story,The film that started my Ozu obsession. Classic.
1.0,tokyo_story,"Pretty depressing old school Japanese flick about kids living their lives and abandoning their parents. However, it's beautiful, sad, and absolutely wonderful. Ozu has such a unique eye and each shot is stunning."
1.0,tokyo_story,A morality play of family members representing a spectrum of filial devotion - I was amazed how I could feel and hear myself in all the characters portrayed.
1.0,tokyo_story,Ozu's comtemplative study of familial detachment is poignant and acheingly beautiful in it's simplicity and emotional resonance.
1.0,tokyo_story,amazing capture of human relationship
1.0,tokyo_story,One of Ozu's best and probably the most accsible to Western viewers. Elderly couple visit their children in Tokyo and end up being passed around by the children who don't have the time or money to waste on them. Typical Ozu formula of the disintegration of the pre-war traditional Japanese lifestyle.
1.0,tokyo_story,Ovviamente √É¬® del 53 e non del 72. La pi√É¬π grande opera d'arte su pellicola di sempre.
1.0,tokyo_story,DEspite the little woman sittingi next to me who was crying the whole movie I think this movie is excellent. Family relationships shown in simple way leaves you thinking about the complexity of values and family in today's societies.
1.0,tokyo_story,Probably my favorite movie... Subtle acting that brings out the core intricacies of human relationships.
1.0,tokyo_story,Very touching story done by great Mr.Ozu

1.0,tokyo_story,leaves you speechless
1.0,tokyo_story,"Simply one of the best, if not THE best movie ever made. Ozu's master work"

1.0,tokyo_story,One of the best Japanese films ever made. Ozu displays his profound insight into human nature.
1.0,tokyo_story,Simply one of the greatest achievements in film. This is simple and elegant storytelling with an ample amount of subtlety.
1.0,tokyo_story,Planted a seed of gloom in my heart recently.
1.0,tokyo_story,One of the best portrayals of intimacy and distance and all the complexities in between human relationships within the context of the family between two and three generations. Profoundly moving through it simplicity. One of the greatest films ever made.
1.0,tokyo_story,"The original of ""Lost in translation"" at Tokyo, but also in family and in generation gap. Hara Setsuko is divinely beautiful..."
1.0,tokyo_story,"yes,subtle, touching, brilliant."
1.0,tokyo_story,One of the three best movies I've ever seen.
1.0,tokyo_story,"Un chef d'oeuvre, un classique, parfait pour d√É¬©couvrir Ozu."
1.0,tokyo_story,This is in my top 3. It's got a subtle tone and a unique shooting style that fits the story line.
1.0,tokyo_story,Tokyo Story (and everything Ozu did) makes me feel naive... a simple story which cuts close to the hidden substance of human integrity and does more to convey the effects of circumstance in our lives than any other film i've seen - to the extent where i can't understand most of what it has to say!
1.0,tokyo_story,A slow moving movie that creeps up on you at the end. A sad story about apathy and loss of character and the difficulty of trying to survive as an empathetic person in an neglecting world.
1.0,tokyo_story,A Masterpiece. A movie which changes your life.
1.0,tokyo_story,One of the best movies ever made.

1.0,tokyo_story,"Any film by Ozu suits me, in fact I have four volumes of his dvd's, but this is the one that introduced me to the work of this remarkable director, and remains a firm favourite. His perceptions of human frailties and foibles are universal and absolutely spot on."
1.0,tokyo_story,"A masterpiece. The sadness and meaningless of human life and pettyness of human nature, told in an intimate and simplistic way, stylistically perfect. But why does this stupid Flixter say it's from 1972? It's from 1953."
1.0,tokyo_story,One of my absolute favorite movies and probably the best one of Ozu! A real Master piece!
1.0,tokyo_story,One of the most beautiful films ever made...Ozu at his most poignant...
1.0,tokyo_story,I cried for days... days.
1.0,tokyo_story,"Not surprisingly, since it was made by a perfectionist, everything about this movie is perfect. Highlights are the cinematography, camera work, script, and of course the acting - especially Setsuko Hara. Very moving with universal themes."
1.0,tokyo_story,"Less is more, one of the most simple and beautiful films I've seen"
1.0,tokyo_story,"Take a day off work, get a good bottle of wine and fall into what could well be the greatest film ever made."

1.0,tokyo_story,"Absolutely the best Ozu film I've seen next to Early Summer. I actually called my mother back home after the movie, just to check how things are.The aesthetic aspects of it is amazing, especially the expression of the mono no aware, is simply flawless."
1.0,tokyo_story,What a brilliant fucking movie...amazing. People who don't get this movie are not adults with real thoughts.
1.0,tokyo_story,The greatest Japanese film I have ever seen. Truly mild and subdued - probably the best showcase of the traditional aesthetic values of the East.

1.0,tokyo_story,"Ozu's masterpiece - Nothing seems of happen but then you reach the end and realize everything has happened, A quiet, subtle but profound life movie. The Flixster movie date of 1972 is wrong. Tokyo Story was released Nov 3, 1953"

1.0,tokyo_story,cinematographic excellence

1.0,tokyo_story,Absolutely amazing. Is that the U.S. release date? It was made in the 50s.
1.0,tokyo_story,"A direct but effective directorial style pervades this classic film. The variety of characters are magnificently real, and Ozo coaxes entire lifetimes out of their expressions. Subtle, touching, brilliant."

1.0,tokyo_story,Masterpiece dramatic movie. Ozu is the best. I always preferd his movies more than Korozawa's ones.
1.0,tokyo_story,"This is a ploddingly slow movie that would never make it on today's fast-paced world--but then again, that's exactly the point of the movie, isn't it? This is a beautiful, moving and painful movie about change, selfishness, life in the fast lane, and the generation gap."

1.0,tokyo_story,Wonderful film! A film that EVERYONE should go to see!
1.0,tokyo_story,"Justin Plummer,Perhaps you shouldn't be watching films of this caliber. You might hurt yourself. Not everyone lives in America, not everyone talks like you, and life isn't full of cuts. Your critique makes no sense. Don't be so ignorant of other cultures, moron."
1.0,tokyo_story,"Ozu's still camera quietly shows us the lives of a Japanese family. The subtleness of the story is reflective of the lives of most normal people, where many find themselves saying quite nonchalantly, ""Yes, life is disappointing."""
1.0,tokyo_story,yes i took film studies.
1.0,tokyo_story,The year should read 1953. An utterly shattering experience. Could be the finest film ever made.

1.0,tokyo_story,"Besides Akira Kurosawa, Yasujiro Ozu is Japan's greatest contribution to film, and here's his signature masterwork. This quietly haunting film will leave you wanting so much more, it's one of the 100 best films ever."

1.0,tokyo_story,Ozu's finest exploration of the human condition. One of the greatest films ever made. Period.
1.0,tokyo_story,Why does this flixter say this movie was made in 72? Didn't Ozu die in the 60's?
0.0,tokyo_story,"I can see how many argue that it ""captures real life"" with its long takes and bland dialogue, but that is no excuse for it being completely uninteresting."

1.0,tokyo_story,"One of the best and most deeply moving films I've ever seen. Ozu is a master at directing to achieve the perfect emotions and tone for this subdued, patient story of love, loss, and family. Probably as poignant and relevant today as it was during its release."

1.0,tokyo_story,"A beautiful, heartbreaking and mesmerizing masterpiece. No other film that I have seen has better captured the essence of an elderly couple's perspective of family chaos. Yasujiro Ozu was, quite simply, the greatest Japanese filmmaker of all time."
1.0,tokyo_story,"An amazing, timeless film. It hardly felt like two hours. Not from 1972, though. It's originally from 1953."
1.0,tokyo_story,"It's style and pace will seem completely off to most audiences. but Ozu's careful, patient, and sympathetic observations of the small painful moments that string a life together is a miracle to behold. Just try not crying towards the end."
1.0,tokyo_story,Heartbreaking and beautiful.
1.0,tokyo_story,"In it's quiet and subdued way, one of the most heart breaking films ever made. I need to see more Ozu."
1.0,tokyo_story,A quiet masterpiece.
1.0,tokyo_story,"At first I thought that the acting by the parents was poor, but it hit me that it was perfectly executed slow old people acting. Plus I hate to admit that I teared up while watching this movie."
1.0,tokyo_story,"Excellent, excellent, excellent. Ozu is incredibly simplistic with the camera work and lets the story flow very lyrically. Ozu clearly deserves to be mentioned in every conversation of great Japanese filmmakers."
1.0,tokyo_story,"Slow and meditative and certainly not to all tastes, but Ozu's most famous work distills all his formal obsessions and has some wonderful central performances subtly conveying the tensions which are concealed between family members."
1.0,tokyo_story,"Slow, but deeply affecting masterpiece drama by Yasujiro Ozu. A very meditative look into the life of a family and its genderation gaps. It's Yasujiro's best film."

1.0,tokyo_story,The film that started my Ozu obsession. Classic.
1.0,tokyo_story,"Heart wrenching, emotional film. I didn't expect it to be so sad, although I think the Criterion cover should've clued me in. The part that affected me the most was when Mother tells Isamu that she wonders if she will be around to see him become a doctor. Nice to see more trains in this film."

1.0,1010792-its_a_wonderful_life,"Maybe the best holiday film of all-time. There's some real magic at work here from Frank Capra, which is timeless. I almost tear up at the finish every time. I would say, however, that George Bailey probably owes his child's teacher an apology."
1.0,1010792-its_a_wonderful_life,"It's interesting to know that this timeless holiday classic actually wasn't a hit when it first came out on Christmas 1946, but was eventually embraced by millions. Cary Grant was considered for the role, but he was busy filming another excellent film, The Bishop's Wife, playing the angel Dudley."
1.0,1010792-its_a_wonderful_life,It's more wonderful every year I watch it. What makes me marvel at this film so much is how hard it would be to nail all these notes with a modern film.

1.0,1010792-its_a_wonderful_life,"Contrary to popular belief, I love this film because it's terribly depressing. Even with the love of family, Bedford Falls is the best you can hope for--for me, this is about settling, and while I might not agree with the message the story is told uncommonly well."

0.0,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,Started ok... until the anti-america propaganda. People torturing apes to the national anthem of the USA. What a joke. China and liberal hollywood cant make a movie without ruining it with their hidden messages.
1.0,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,"This is a spectacular movie. Despite its longer than average duration (2'20"") there was never a dull moment. The special effects were amazing And the locales breathtaking. A very satisfying sci-fi movie. Movies like these are what cinema is about."

0.0,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,A movie written by anti-fa. All nationalists are mental cases or Uncle Toms that are dead-set on enslaving other races to build a wall. The only ones that are to be spared are the voiceless blonde ladies they take with them.

1.0,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,"War For The Planet Of The Apes is a war film that puts character drama in the foreground to tell a stunningly captivating, sharp, cinematic and personal story. It's a masterfully crafted film heavily complimented with stellar performances and a beautiful score."
1.0,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,Amazing film. Fantastic special effects. This movie restores my faith in Hollywood's ability to deliver an involving story with characters I can be emotionally invested in. Very highly recommended. Here's hoping they follow this up with a sequel.
1.0,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,best film of the series. was a really satisfying end. i enjoyed this film beginning to end. i enjoyed the characters and the action. the developments were interesting and well plotted. this is a good film

0.0,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,I think this franchise has run it's course
1.0,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,War for the Planet of the Apes is among one of the finest epics of our time! Andy Serkis is still impressive and captivating to watch as the great Caesar!
1.0,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,"Although a very slight drop from the previous film (Dawn) being a bit long/slow at times, it does continue to entertain and keep the reboot collection in tact. Not common to see an original and two sequels all receive such high reviews... great job with the entire reboot for a new generation!"
1.0,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,Its a marvelous and poetic story about loss and what that does to people.
1.0,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,The third installment in the Apes trilogy is very powerful and emotional while telling the story of a biblical epic.
1.0,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,The final film in the Ape trilogy is a brilliant biblical epic that focuses on characters and how their pain changes them instead of mindless action.
0.0,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,"Boring, slow, cheesy, super cut of lifetime TV movie moments, plot didn't make sense, characters did things that did not logically make sense or were not true to character. Really aweful movie."
1.0,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,"War is one of the best films in general and one of the best third films in a trilogy that completes the arcs it created for its characters, tells a unique original story while also homaging that makes sense, but also does unexpected things with story and how it plays out."
1.0,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,Serkis and Harrelson sky rocket this movie into being perhaps better than it has any business being. Its commentary on the way we treat one another within society and what truly makes us human is astoundingly visceral and though provoking. Maybe the best film of 2017.
1.0,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,"Wow. That's all I have to say, it was brilliant. The story is complex and interesting, there were certainly a lot of emotional parts and the action wasn't the best but still one of the best I've seen in a long time."

1.0,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,"Perhaps the best film of 2017.

1.0,the_babadook,"One of the scariest movies of the decade (if not all time), The Babadook hits so close to home because it's actually a story about very relatable human emotions like grief. It's scary because what the Babadook stands for IS actually real."

1.0,the_babadook,"I don't remember the last time I saw a better, deeper horror film. Proof that the genre can produce a film with as much substance as anything with an Oscar nomination."

0.0,the_babadook,So very bad. I think people are just hopping on the band wagon with this one because I wasn't scared or intrigued what-so-ever. I'm all about supporting an independent film but this movie does NOT deserve the praise it is getting.
1.0,the_babadook,A masterpiece of psychological horror. The line between reality and fantasy isn't so much blurred as it is altogether obliterated.

1.0,boyhood,Maybe the best movie ever made?
0.0,boyhood,That it was filmed over 12 years is a good indication why you shouldn't make a movie like this again. Please don't. I hated every minute of it. Long and boring.
0.0,boyhood,"Patiently original, inaudibly nostalgic, but completely overrated. Watching Mason on screen is a dim but exceptionally unperceptive recasting of our own awkward acquaintances with growing up."

0.0,boyhood,"I really long, drawn out home movie, with very little plot. I don't understand how this movie had such high reviews. Maybe it's because it was filmed for over a decade is my guess. It was extremely uninteresting, and I was having to push myself to continue to watch it."

1.0,boyhood,"One of the most incredible, unique and completely original movies I have ever seen. Watching a cast and plot grow and change through 12 devoted years is what makes this film superb."
0.0,boyhood,"Beyond tedious. If you want to see a dull movie about dull ordinary people, this is for you. The use of the same actor over 12 years is a gimmick, and added nothing to the movie. Riveting scenes of parents telling their kids to do their homework. Snooze."

1.0,boyhood,"Boyhood (in my opinion), is one of the best films since 2000. It beats the no-plot present category, as the conflicts Mason (Ellar Coltrane) faces are all extremely believable. It contains the perfect amounts of drama, suspense, romance, and action."

1.0,boyhood,"Richard Linklater has the guts to make innovative films. First, he made the ""Before..."" trilogy, now with ""Boyhood"" he showed us that there are still new ideas to make movies.

1.0,boyhood,My personal best of 2014. The story of a boy from the age of 6 to 18. So beautifully taken. Watching the movie will remind us of our childhood which makes it even more special. Terrific performances by the actors. Richard Linklater had the guts to make something like this and nailed it.
1.0,boyhood,Extremely impactful to the mind and the heart. I think this is a creative work of art. Haven't seen anything like it. Love the young mans character and who he turns out to be. Spot on. Totally nailed it with the way kids of this generation frame up the world and society they are living in.

1.0,boyhood,12 years. Great story telling. Watching the actors grow up and older was so much better than make up.

1.0,boyhood,"Despite being a complete exposing of every teenage boy's life, its hard to find flaws in this passion project from Linklater, who seems to make us laugh and feel hurt as the family go from one pain to another as well as the touching moments of peace Mason gets with his father."
1.0,boyhood,"10. Bellissimo. Fantastico. Stupendo. Completo. Vero. Puro. Uno dei pi√π bei film che io abbia mai visto. Chiunque lo pu√≤ vedere, non ha et√†, e ognuno lo pu√≤ far suo. GUARDATELO."

1.0,boyhood,"A bit long, but very well thought out and executed drama."
0.0,boyhood,"One of the most boring movies ever made. I think people may be dazzled by the story of how the movie was made rather than the movie itself. Frankly, that's the only rational explanation I can find to explain all the whoopla surrounding this."

0.0,boyhood,"The only cool thing about this movie is that they showed all the characters age, but other than that, the movie went absolutely no where. It just dragged on and on and on.

1.0,boyhood,A 12 Year Phenomenal Masterpiece. Everyone should atleast see this once.
1.0,boyhood,Arquette and Hawk work their magic but would have liked to see a little more from Coltrane. The nostalgia of growing up in the early 2000's makes up for it though. Definitely lives up to the hype.

1.0,boyhood,An elaborate and rich approach for a coming-of-age by Linklater.
0.0,boyhood,"The main premise of this film seems to be that just when you expect that something is going to happen, nothing does.

0.0,boyhood,Pure dreck. More painful than doing at home dentistry.
1.0,boyhood,This is movie is really EPIC. It tells a common story of growing up and is shot over 12 years just like how the story takes place.
1.0,boyhood,"Boyhood is, obviously, a very personal film for director Richard Linklater. A moving epic filmed over the course of 12 years, sprawling with human emotion and capturing life, Boyhood is a flawless masterpiece with a stellar cast, including an Oscar-winning performance by Patricia Arquette."
0.0,boyhood,"Boring, over-long, and lacking in plot. A boy ages from age 6 to 18, and over the course of 165 minutes, very little happens that is interesting or engaging. Filming over 12 years with the same actors ends up being just a gimmick. Should not have even been nominated for best picture."
1.0,boyhood,Simply one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life so far.
1.0,boyhood,Almost three hours of boredom and absolute brilliance. So understated you completely forget there is any acting going on. Like watching a documentary. One of the more original flicks I've seen in ages. I loved Birdman but this movie deserved best picture.

1.0,boyhood,"Watching this film was, personally, a profound trip down memory lane. I'm afraid that anything I say regarding this film won't do it any justice... it was breathlessly touching. One of many things, I felt distressed for Mason's mom as she said ""I thought there would be more""."

0.0,boyhood,The only cool thing about this movie is the fact that it was filmed over 12 years and you get to see the same actors getting old... But it's so not worth the 2 hours and 44 minutes you waste watching it!
1.0,boyhood,I LOVE THIS MOVIE SO MUCH!
0.0,boyhood,Ive been having nightmares ever since I watched this movie. The nightmares are that it will never end. Almost 3 hours of absolutely nothing.
1.0,boyhood,Amazing film that shows the everyday struggles with getting older and wiser.
1.0,boyhood,"Can see why Boyhood got an Oscar Nomination. The film was shot over 12 years, of the SAME characters. I thought it was very good. Told a story of a lad in his teen years ie adolescence."
1.0,boyhood,"Compelling from start to finish, Boyhood is brimming with humour, humanity, nostalgia and is ultimately so much more than its filmed-over12-years gimmick. Though that is really cool too. This movie explores the journey of adolescence with honesty yet somehow still manages to be very entertaining."

0.0,boyhood,"Boring, uneventful. The novelty of true aging of the characters didn't make up for Patricia Arquette's poor performance."
1.0,boyhood,"A culmination of over a decade of investment, Boyhood captures the magic of life and growing up in such a simplistic approach that it feels as if we're growing up all over again while watching it."

1.0,hell_or_high_water,"Superb cast. Filmed like a western. Not a shoot-me-up type but more of a drama with great character development. Ben Foster is his typical self, nevertheless excellent. Chris Pine looking good and being bad ass as always. Jeff Bridges is smarter than he sounds."
1.0,hell_or_high_water,3 great actors just knocking it out of the park.. Great little heist film that you think would be predictable but is still fresh and suspenseful. Great character development.

1.0,hell_or_high_water,Hell or High Water delivers a familiar story on a smaller scale with so much raw human energy that it feels fresh against all the blockbusters we are so used to seeing today. Chris Pine shows us his full range here and stands out in this incredibly talented cast.

1.0,hell_or_high_water,Being from west Texas I obviously have some bias but I loved this movie. Bridges pretty much revises his character from True Grit and Crazy Heart to fill the roll as a modern Texas ranger. Great soundtrack that helps draw you into the environment.

1.0,creed_2015,"In the year of a seventh film in a franchise that started in the 70s with the same premise as the original, this is by far the best one. The filmmaking aspects of Creed honestly rival Rocky. It's criminally underrated, and easily one of the best of the year."

1.0,creed_2015,"Creed breathed fresh life into the Rocky series- one that had been buried by not only the world, but Sylvester Stallone himself as well. This spin-off movie not only pleases older Rocky movie fans, but also interests and excites a new generation of movie goers."

1.0,creed_2015,Excellent as good as the first
1.0,creed_2015,"What a fitting conclusion (?) to the Rocky story! This is probably the 2nd best entry in the series. It's a boxing story, love story and family story all rolled into one. And most importantly NEVER forget who you are and where you came from. Should have been nominated for Best Picture."

1.0,schindlers_list,"Schindler's List starts out as a historical-context buisness film, but becomes an emotionally tender story. Steven Spielberg puts on a massive display of honest humanity and bleak, horrific reality supported by Liam Neeson's fully-involved and dynamic portrayal of Schindler."

1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Absolutely Love it. One of my FAVORITES
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Henry Fonda gives possibly the best performance I've ever seen in film.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,John Steinbeck was so stunned by John Ford's adaptation of his classic he quipped 'I believed my own story again'.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"John Fords best film, IMO, you know you did a good film adaptation of a book when the original author liked it more than his own book."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Real gut wrenching film.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Almost as devastating and as superb as the book.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,John Ford's timeless adaptation of the John Steinbeck classic is quite simply one of the greatest movies ever made. It follows the book very closely (Steinbeck wrote the screenplay) and remains to this day both powerful and poignant.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,wow. Still wish I could find the 1989 Steppenwolf production on DVD
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"CLASSIC! About a family in the depression...if you think times are tough now, wathc this movie! Highly recommended! I love this film!"

1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"With the exception of a couple of melodramatic speeches from Ma Joad in the last ten minutes of the film, this is pretty much a perfect movie. Fonda and Darwell are terrific as Tom Joad and Ma Joad, and John Carradine is suitably prophetic as a lapsed preacher."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Must See! The thousands who have read the book will know why THEY DID NOT SELL ANY CHILDREN TICKETS to see this picture!

1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"Fantastic! One of John Fords best in a filmography of great films. I loved James Stewart in Philadelphia Story, but Henry Fonda should have won the Best Actor Oscar. Jane Darwell was one of the gretest charachter actors ever to live."

1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Classic American motion pictures this unsentimental are rare. It might be Ford's best (without Duke anyway)
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"This is a movie better than the book. Don't get me wrong Steinbeck outstanding writer, but America at its best doesn't need socialism. AS moive point the New Deal is better"
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"Loved the novel, loved the movie, simple as that."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,So many John Ford movies to pick from. This is certainly one of his greatest works ever.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Truly a great movie. Perhaps it is because of the honesty it portrays in the characters.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Change movie making and storytelling entirely/.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"Wow. One of the only older dramas that is still very gripping. A great pace and story, wonderful characters. What is it about this and To Kill A Mockingbird that we don't have anymore in movies?"
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,A Classic! Henry Fonda's performance was amazing. This movie shows the crushed human spirit.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Warning to students. The ending of the movie is radically different than the ending of the book.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"One of my favorite all time movies. Brings the meaning of ""dirt poor"" right home."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"amazing. the film was made so realistically, and helped to expose the terrible conditions that these people faced at the time.."

1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Truly great film with great performances. Almost as moving as the book.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,A classic that is just as powerful today as it was upon its release over 65 years ago. For me Henry Fonda's performance ranks as one of the greatest of all time. This is what movies were meant to be.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"A perfect and emotional motion picture. Beautifully written, directed and performed. The cast evokes a collective spirit rarely felt in contemporary cinema. A classic."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"A great film. On every level. ""We're the people!"""
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,*sighs* thats what we do... never give up.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Not as glamourous as some of his Westerns but I still think that it's John Ford's best work. Henry Fonda is so engaging and the mood and feel of this film is perfect for the subject matter.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"I wish more movies today had plots like this. Had filming like this. I think the most prominent special effect was the lighting, and it did so much for the story. The acting was classic...brilliant."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Steinbeck is just as good onscreen as he is on the page.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"Not only is the film rich in plot and acting, the direction and lighting is heavenly. Henry Fonda is truely a master of the art. Too bad he wasn't given an Oscar until the 1980's."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,A history lesson and a great film classic. I wish they make this kind of high-standard movies nowadays.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"Steinbeck's Dust Bowl story by way of Ford's poetic realism. Fonda and Darwell, among others, shine."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"No sex,no violence of any note and it's obviously not in colour. The film though pulls you in until you are 'virtually' part of the family and you experience every emotion they do...at 14 years, seeing this film is what made me a man...I wanted to be a Tom Joad!"
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"Intense, A classic amongst classics."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,John Ford's greatest achievement and one of the finest films ever made. Henry Fonda gives his finest performance ever and Jane Darwell is immortal in an Oscar-winning portrayal of his mum.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"Astonishing piece of cinema that I really wanted to go on and on. Both dialogue and direction excel at lifting from the pages of the book a true masterpiece, slightly spoiled by a Hollywood ending. Aside from that it was cinematic perfection."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,What solidifies its greatness is John Ford's ability to blend the personal and political without causing damage to either characters or themes.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"John Ford made this Steinbeck classic to a ""T"". Fonda's portrayal of Tom Joad is wonderfully real and charismatically appealing. I love this story because of its historically based storyline. The plight of the working man vs. mr. banker. / inspired Bruce Springsteen to write/"
0.0,grapes_of_wrath,"Its actually more painful to watch the movie than it is to read the book, kind of like concentrated torture."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"Not easy to make a film as good as a Steinbeck novel, but with Henry Fonda and John Carradine, this was one of the all time best in film."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Another movie I watched with my Dad. He really helped me connect with the storyline by telling me about his own childhood as the youngest of 7 children born to a family forced to migrate during the Great Depression.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"Not as detailed as the book, but captures the essence of it."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"Humanist, idealistic, beautiful..."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"An amazing film, I just loose myself every time I watch it."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Wonderful film. Fonda has never been better. Jane Darwell is magnificent. Their last scene together is one of the greats of cinema. Heartbreaking.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Probably the best political movie out of the US of A.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"Not many films have come from the USA with a Socialist message, but hey quality counts for something!"
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,One of the greatest American movies ever made.

1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"Ok it√Ç¬¥s from (1939?) 1940 and it has been sanitized a little, to make it easier for mass audiences- but still a great movie and an even better read!"
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Steinbeck and Ford at their best
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Another addition to Ford's resevoir of masterpieces. Fonda and Darwell truly seem like mother and son. I loved this film since i was a kid.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"You are Tom Joad. You just got out of prison for stealing, not because you got off for good behavior, but because they simply couldn't afford to keep you anymore. The only difference is that it's not the year 2010"
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"This is a great movie, it will stir your heart."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,a great depiction of the great depression
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,A movie based off of the book about the great depression. Henry fonda is fantastic in this film. Not his best role but one of my favorites. It really portrays the struggles and hardships occuring during the great depression. It's not boring at all.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,An absolute classic tale of human suffereing. A great adaptation of a classic.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"What can I sat, when Ma Joad is putting her things in the stove when they;re leaving their farm behind, I bawl like a little baby. Sure there are a few hammy parts near the end, but darn I start to breaking up again when Tom sings Red River Valley while dancing with his Ma."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"Excellent.....only word I can use to describe this film. Arguably Henry Fonda's best performance, and one of the most noteworthy historical films of American cinema."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,A movie that lives up to the book.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"Har inte l√§st boken, men den kan inte g√§rna vara b√§ttre."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Flawless. Few stories have been portrayed as powerfully and with such emotional connection. Gritty realism at its best.
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Another rare film that outdoes the literary classic it is portraying
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"An emotionally poweful tale set during the Great Depression, about a destitute American family from the plains who go through suffering and despair in order to find work in a country that was itself in despair. Henry Fonda gives a career-best performance as the headstrong young Tom Joad."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,The lighting techniques are awesome and erie

1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"Once upon a time, there was something called 'US Socialism'. There was Debs, there was a 'dangerous' movement of immigrant labor. Then came the 'New Deal', crushing it all. Oh well."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"A story of poverty, corruption, capitalism, anarchism and activism, but mostly the story of a family struggling to survive and stick together in depression-era United States."
1.0,grapes_of_wrath,One of the greatest movies of all time and one of the few movies that rival the novel form. Henry Fonda's performace was absolutely inspiring and this is the most realistic movie I've ever seen.

1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"This movie should be shown to every high school student today. People need to be reminded that there was a time not so long ago when the country seemed on top of the world, and then everything crashed. This movie is a heart breaker and a life changer."

1.0,grapes_of_wrath,"This definately enters into my Top 50 films...erm maybe top 20. The acting is mediocore, but it's the 1940s afterall. I recommend this movie to people even if they aren't into these kinds of movies. Fairly accurate to the novel..."

1.0,grapes_of_wrath,Amazing movie. Ford and Fonda near the top of their game.

0.0,star_wars,"The movie was extremely generic, lacked character development to the point that if every single one of the main/supporting characters died I would not even be close to caring. Lucas as a director failed to deliver a good or even an original plot which was very disappointing."

0.0,star_wars,Overrated. Honestly all of the characters come off as punk ass whiny white boys/cunts.
1.0,star_wars,The start of the legendary franchise. Although it came out 10years before my time it's easy to see the impact it had on the way blockbusters were made ever since. The Mythology behind these films is so good its had generations hooked for nearly 40years.

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,Wonderful film. I have seen it twice and look forward to watching it again. The sweet way that Charlie falls for Rose is something that only two wonderful actors can portray. The scene where Bogart imitates the hippos and makes her laugh is adorable. The wedding is unforgettable.

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"John Huston filmed his World War I epic on location, which was an unusual decision at the time, but the grittiness and festering of the jungle perfectly matches the griminess of our main characters, played by Bogart and Hepburn."

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"The 1951 classic that won Humphrey Bogart an Oscar and inspired the Jungle Cruise at Disneyland was every bit as awesome as I had pictured it. The special effects are definitely of their time, but that doesn't stop it from being a timeless film."
1.0,the_african_queen_1951,The first of a series of boy meets girl and they take on the world. Once again a classic movie with two of the greatest actors to ever live. Joe versus the Volcano might be said to be a take off of AQ. Very loosely. Same struggles different picture.

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"The relationship between Bogey and Hepburn is marvelous, as they first despise each other and then long for one another. Charlie Alnut is one of cinema's best characters, often overshadowed by Bogey's own Fred C. Dobbs. A trek well-worth the taking."
1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"There are a couple stars in each generation that steal our hearts so completely we'll watch anything they're in. Bogey and Kate are both such stars, and to see them together in a well-made (John Huston) film is a delight worth savoring again and again."

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,Bogart and Hepburn clicked! This was a wonderful flick.

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"This little gem has it all. Good love story for the girls, and enough action to keep a guy from squirming too much.One small compliant, I would have drowned Hepburn when she dumped the first bottle of gin overboard, but that's just a personal reaction. A definite classic!"
1.0,the_african_queen_1951,"One of my favs... for me this film is a clever metaphor for marriage. It is a poignant and smart story about negotiation, disguised as a trivial comedy. Just lovely!"

1.0,the_african_queen_1951,One of my all time favourites! The chemistry between Bogart and Hepburn is indescribable.

But alas this movie does have a happy end and we do see a marked change in both characters.

1.0,bicycle_thieves,The use of neorealism gives this film it's edge! This film gives us empathy to the characters that are in it so that we can look at the positives in our life. What a sad story seeing the way Italians lived in the fascist era near the end of World War II.

1.0,bicycle_thieves,"Seeing it for the 2nd time yesterday, I was once again thrust into Victorrio De Sica's world; The Bicycle Thief is a nakedly honest view of the slums of Italy, that does not hide it's themes among melodramatic plots, but puts in plain view, and therein lies it's wonder."
1.0,bicycle_thieves,"Lyrical and beautiful, yet political to the core: by focussing so intensely on one man's desperation De Sica illuminates a much larger theme with great humanity. But it is unarguably the case that the film is too long and drags at times."
1.0,bicycle_thieves,A tragic masterpiece.

1.0,bicycle_thieves,"Has less a primal pull than Umberto D, that masterpiece of the imperiled puppy genre. Still, this is dramatically wrenching, and a vivid exploration of the economic life of a city besides."

1.0,bicycle_thieves,Got to screen this in class today. I always forget how brilliant it is. I think I prefer Umberto D as an example of Neo-Realism but this still an emotionally devastating experience.
1.0,bicycle_thieves,The greatest Italian neo-realist film. A boy loses his innocence and a man becomes what he hates most. Simplistic yet universal and timeless. What I find most astonishing about this gentle film is how the most tender and simple images can evoke such a strong emotional response.

1.0,bicycle_thieves,Touching. Heart-wrenching. Sometimes comic. Little Bruno will absolutely be your favorite character. A charming story and charming approach to telling it.
1.0,bicycle_thieves,This powerfully constructed film examines the themes of desperation and justice (or the lack thereof) surrounding an event as seemingly insignificant as a stolen bicycle.

1.0,bicycle_thieves,"Simply brilliant. De Sica adds such a sense of realism that you feel like you suffer along main character, Ricci. Bicycle Thieves fortunately doesn't follow the stereotypical Hollywood movie of that time and ultimately delivers a powerful social commentary."
1.0,bicycle_thieves,"De Sica's humanization of poverty still stands out in today's time, when the only difference is perhaps the nature or geography of the extreme situation he portrays."

0.0,birdman_2014,"Insanely boring and unwatchable, I tried keeping up with the characters and plot but was simply unable to penetrate the sheer inanity of it all. This must have been a movie for the critics. Also, wasn't impressed by the monotone artsy score. It detracted from the movie."

0.0,birdman_2014,Just awful. I could care less what happened to any of the characters. It's a movie made for movie people and anyone who said it was good is lying to themselves to make themselves appear more cultured.Terrible. So disappointed. Great acting ... but that does not a good movie make.
1.0,birdman_2014,This film never lets you take your eyes away from the movie. You will be fixated on the screen the whole time you watch. Birdman Is as character driven a movie you will ever see. Every actor gives their all in what was my favorite movie of 2014.
1.0,birdman_2014,"Quite simply a milestone in cinematic achievement, not only is Birdman more visually impressive than most summer blockbusters but its as witty as a Tarantino film, as deep as a Nolan film and exposes more about the film industry as a forbes magazine could even dream of.

1.0,open_city,"A great early Italian Neo-Realism film, a must see."
1.0,open_city,"Unusually tight plotting for a neorealist film, though just as moving."
1.0,open_city,Open City is unquestionably one of the strongest dramatic films yet made about the recent war. And the fact that it was hurriedly put together by a group of artists soon after the liberation of Rome is significant of its fervor and doubtless integrity
1.0,open_city,"""We mustn't be afraid now or in the future,"" says Francesco, ""because we are on the just path."" Loaded with the kind of raw power that sneaks up on you and slaps you in the face, Rome Open City is totally devastating and immediate, a masterpiece of the post-war Italian realism movement."

1.0,open_city,An excellent film about the german occupation of Italy. Its unbelieveable that this film was shot in 1946 during which some of Italy was still being liberated. The performances are great and Rossellinis very subtle style is perfect for the subject matter. An incredibly important film.

1.0,open_city,Try and get the Criterion Collection version as there is VERY interesting commentary on this film that portrays how a country can get on again after (what is basically) a civil war.
1.0,open_city,Anna Magnani is the heart of the movie in this key film of the neorealistic period.

1.0,battleship_potemkin,Maravillosa propaganda
1.0,battleship_potemkin,"As a film major, I am pretty much required to give this 5 stars, because of the revolutionary standard it set in terms of editing. However, this film was funded by the state, and it shows. Story is pretty much propaganda for the revolution that had recently taken place."

1.0,battleship_potemkin,"The most important film ever produced. Without this films would not be made as they are today. Anyone who has an opinion on film that has not seen this, is not entitled to an opinion as this is like saying Protons are the best car when you don't know what a Ferrari is!!!!"
1.0,battleship_potemkin,"I've seen untold ripoffs of Eisentstein's clever visual devices. Despite his politics, his moveimaking was phenomenal. It's still emulated today...though not as well usually."

1.0,battleship_potemkin,"An epic movie - in both its contribution to the language of films, and its story of the rise of the oppressed against the powers that be. That scene where the pram rolls of the stairs and the lady gets shot in the eye... it sort of sticks, you know..."

1.0,battleship_potemkin,One of the most important films ever made. A landmark in cinematic history.
1.0,battleship_potemkin,"A marvelous feat of editing and, to a lesser extent cinematography, masquerading as a soviet propaganda film."
1.0,battleship_potemkin,It should be made compulsory to watch this film -- and that statement coming from a self-confessed right leftist/left rightist/whateverist should be enough.
1.0,battleship_potemkin,"An iconic piece of film-making by a pioneer and a master.  Eisenstein's theorys of editing and directing have influenced (directly or indirectly) every film-maker that has followed.  All that aside: this is a really good movie, too!"
1.0,battleship_potemkin,This is the best film I have ever seen. The Odessa Steps sequence is unbelievable cinematography.
1.0,battleship_potemkin,"The birth of editing as we know it to date! A movie where the hero is the ""people"", the battleship is more like a collective soul of the mob. It has one of the greatest scenes on cinema, the stairs of Odessa, breathtaking and depressing to watch. Brilliant film!"

1.0,battleship_potemkin,"Want to know everything about cinematography? Don't go to the college, watch ""Battleship Potemkin""."
1.0,battleship_potemkin,Just watched the 2005 restoration released by Kino last year. By far the best DVD version available.
1.0,battleship_potemkin,"Considering it was made in 1925, it would be rude not to award this five stars. Visually stunning, the film charts the beginnings of the Odessa uprising from the crew of the Potemkin. It's easy to see why this, at times brutal film, is viewed as a masterpiece."

1.0,battleship_potemkin,"If you love movies watch this, if you only want to be entertained don't bother. This is where good cinema starts. Amazing film given the time and the technology, you will need to watch it more the once."
1.0,battleship_potemkin,"Very dramatic, exciting, and sometimes heartbreaking Soviet Union silent film about one ship's rebellion and the revolution it inspired. The Odessa steps is the best silent film sequence I've ever seen."
1.0,battleship_potemkin,This film is only good for the famous step scene. But boy what a scene. See the version with the muisc by Shostakovich which adds to the drama of it.

1.0,battleship_potemkin,"Eisenstein's silent classic is a cornerstone of 20th century Russian cinema. So much is expressed through the absolute disillusionment and anger of the sailors.

Everything from the maggots on the meat to the fading images of the men hanging from the poles to massacre on the steps of Odessa, are some of the many reasons this movie was far ahead of its time."
1.0,battleship_potemkin,A Soviet silent gem. This movie was the inspiration for so many other great films. Eisenstein was a genius of his time and his own life would make an excellent movie.
1.0,battleship_potemkin,"Perhaps Eisenstein's greatest film; a perfect example of his dialectical theory of montage. The narrative and cinematography are nothing like what we're accustomed to today, so be prepared to do some work on the audience end in order to get what Eisenstein's up to here."

1.0,french_connection,"It is of course a classic, and cool to see how this 1971 movie set the trend for a different kind of realism in cop dramas. And Hackman and Scheider are so young."

1.0,french_connection,"A tense, thrilling, powerful and fast paced thriller, The French Connection is easily one of the best thrillers around and its helped because of its outstanding performances and impeccable direction."
1.0,french_connection,A masterpiece from Friedkin. Popeye Doyle is probably my all time favourite cops. Hackman is on fire and that fricking car chase. A wonerful tale of cat and mouse.

0.0,french_connection,"It may have had relevance as a new style in 1971, but this film has little appeal today. TFC has been outdone by better directors since its release while the genre has been copied more times than logically possible for decades.

1.0,french_connection,"The most realistic cop movie ever. It is slow at times, but that is because it recreates the pace of a cop's job. Gene Hackman's best performance and an strong sense of time and place more than makes up for it."

1.0,french_connection,"Well, this ""dirty cop"" drama is quite odd, but of course as humorous, expertly well-acted, and action-wise the most thrilling of all-time. A 1971 Pontiac LeMans vs. an elevated train (with a fleeing hitman onboard) is what makes this film famous."
1.0,french_connection,"The original gritty, urban cop movie. Gene Hackman proves you don't have to be pretty when you know how to kick ass."
1.0,french_connection,"Slick, well-plotted, and with a terrific cast. Hackman never fails to deliver, and Scheider is great as well. This is a phenomenal movie, and a defining film of its generation. The critic that gave this a rotten should be tarred and feathered."

1.0,french_connection,"Flawless, only Harry Callahan can top Popeye Doyle when it comes to cops on the silver screen"

1.0,french_connection,"Along with Dirty Harry, the greatest cop film of all time."
1.0,french_connection,Tied with Bullitt for the best cop film of all time. Hackman & Schieder make a great team. Some amazing car chases & cool shootouts.

1.0,french_connection,"Great movie, fantastic car chase. Can't beat 70's cinema."
1.0,french_connection,"A movie that goes far beyond a memorable car chase scene, The French Connection maintains full force to date by the raw picture of urban decay, and above all by the coldly pessimistic ending, possible reflections of the North American political scene of then."

1.0,french_connection,"I don't have time to give this a proper review right now, but all you need to know is that it's the best detective film ever made and you should go out of your way to see this masterpiece! Popeye Doyle (Hackman) more than gives Dirty Harry a run for his money."

1.0,french_connection,"Arguably the greatest crime film of all time; it's intensity is felt throughout, and it's action sequences, particularly the car-train chase scene, are some of the most dramatic of it's genre. The ending is poignant and strikes a nerve, and it just feels oh-so perfect."

1.0,french_connection,Excellent crime drama. Gotta love that chase scene.
1.0,french_connection,One of the best Gene Hackmen Movies you will ever see!
1.0,french_connection,"Best Cop movie ever. Best Car Chase in a movie ever, Bullitt sucks. Popeye rocks!"
1.0,french_connection,Ambiguity is what elevates this film above typical cop/action genre. The moral uncertainty encountered throughout the movie perfectly characterizes New York City in the 1970s- not a happy place to be. Futility is the name of the game.
0.0,french_connection,"yes the car-subway train car chase was pretty awesome in this, but the rest of this was dull as hell."
1.0,french_connection,Awesome. One of the best chase scenes.

1.0,french_connection,"Excellent award-winner is gripping and visceral, yet as cold in tone as a New York alley on a cloudy day..."
1.0,french_connection,"probably one of the most underrated police dramas even though it won the Academy Award. Gene Hackman and Roy Scheider are simply fantastic as two New York City Narc detectives. Has a really good car chase, one that could even rival the one in ""Bullitt""."

1.0,french_connection,"Along with Bullitt and Dirty Harry, this is one of the best of those gritty action movies that came out in the late 60s/early70s. Hackman's ""Popeye"" Doyle is blundering and borderline incompetent - ultimately more human than most movie cops, if not more sympathetic. Check out the sequel as well."

1.0,french_connection,Among my all time favorites. I don't know why.
1.0,french_connection,"Absolutely spectacular cop film from director William Friedkin. Gene Hackman is Popeye Doyle, a New York cop who has a method all his own. The action and excitement don't let up for a second, and this film won the Oscar for Best Picture, 1971. Don't miss it!"

1.0,sunset_boulevard,Even though All About Eve is a masterpiece as well Sunset should have been awarded with Best Picture Oscar because it's arguably the best film about Hollywood. Perfect media satire. Timeless.
1.0,sunset_boulevard,"For a movie about an incredibly over-the-top individual, Sunset Boulevard is nothing short of being one of the most grounded, tragic, and thematically rich American films ever made"
1.0,sunset_boulevard,"""The poor dope - he always wanted a pool. Well, in the end, he got himself a pool."""

1.0,sunset_boulevard,A classic film that features one of the greatest performances with Gloria Swanson as aging silent film star Norma Desmond.
1.0,sunset_boulevard,A must see classic. Sunset Boulevard revolves around a past actress and a screenwriter set in 1950 Hollywood it gives us a great insight on the film business back then. A must see movie.
1.0,sunset_boulevard,It is everything I could have ever hoped for from Film Noir film!
1.0,sunset_boulevard,"Critiquing the fleeting nature of fame and the emptiness of Hollywood, ""Sunset Boulevard"" is a classic filled with dark symbolism, scathing wit, and an absolutely iconic performance from Gloria Swanson."
1.0,sunset_boulevard,"One of the very bests, Sunset Boulevard boasts an excellent cast, an incredible screenplay and the typical outstanding Wilder direction."
1.0,sunset_boulevard,"""Back in the pool again, the one I always wanted.""-Joe Gillis (William Holden)Would the next chimp step in line.""I'm ready for my close up Demille""-Norma Desmond (Gloria Swanson)Hollywood/insane"
1.0,sunset_boulevard,Watching it on TCM way way back and now makes me wonder why did I not appreciate it more. Guess I did not have a taste for this back then. *sigh*
1.0,sunset_boulevard,"One of the great film noirs, this movie stands the test of time. Brilliantly written and brilliantly acted."
1.0,sunset_boulevard,"One of my all time favorite films. This is as good as movies get. The comedy, the noir elements, Swanson's campiness and melodrama are all a perfect fit. The Hollywood setting just memorializes the movie. Billy Wilder is one of my favorite directors, and this is him at his finest"
1.0,sunset_boulevard,"Incredible. One of the best movies about Hollywood ever made. Great performances, great music, great writing, and great direction from Billy Wilder."
1.0,sunset_boulevard,"In the end I think the message of this great film is a testament of the old adage about the camera stealing the soul. Also has that interesting technique of staring a movie with the end and then building the story from the beginning, which Quentin Tarantino popularized much later."
1.0,sunset_boulevard,"Embarrassed at how long it took me to get around to this incredible film, which was easily one of the best of the 1950s. Billy Wilder was a genius."
1.0,sunset_boulevard,"Although it dragged in some parts, I loved this movie. It was brilliantly acted, especially by Gloria Swanson. She plays Norma Desmond, a former movie star who goes borderline insane. I highly recommend it for any psychology, sociology, or film classes!"

1.0,sunset_boulevard,Absolutely phenomenal!! I cannot believe I've gone this long without swing this!!
1.0,sunset_boulevard,MASTERPIECE!! IT'S OVER 4000
1.0,sunset_boulevard,Great film! Can't believe it took me so long to see it.

1.0,sunset_boulevard,"A perfectly crafted work of art that fully engages its viewer in it's story of desperation. The demented star is portrayed to perfection by Gloria Swanson, William Holden is perfectly cast as the B-movie screenwriter."

1.0,sunset_boulevard,Gloria Swanson... that is all.

1.0,sunset_boulevard,"Packed with stunning performances, particularly on Swanson's behalf, and a haunting script, Sunset Boulevard tackles it's unusual subjects head on without making the film too outrageous."

1.0,sunset_boulevard,"Masterpiece. Filmed with great skill (lots of lovely Kane-like shots of the huge house), great actors, awesome screenplay. Worth every penny."
1.0,sunset_boulevard,"Billy Wilder's classic is a film noir, a dark comedy, a psychological drama, and the greatest film about the illusion of stardom."
1.0,sunset_boulevard,This film screams iconic which is ironic because it is the fall of the icon and the foolishness of taking stock of such a thing in the first place that this tragedy hinges upon. Those who know the history of the medium will appreciate this film more.
1.0,sunset_boulevard,At first I was only interested in this movie because of Carol Burnett. I wanted to know who Norma Desmond was. It's become one of my favorite movies!!
1.0,sunset_boulevard,"Bill Wilder creates this amazing Hollywood film-noir masterpiece about Hollywood, with towering performances, unforgettable quotes and an entertaining story."
1.0,sunset_boulevard,The ending scene alone is enough for me to call this film epic!
1.0,sunset_boulevard,"A great movie, but you'll be disturbed by the end."
1.0,sunset_boulevard,"One of Hollywood's best -- and a satire of Hollywood itself, one that gets better with age."
1.0,sunset_boulevard,A character study of an aging silent film star through the eyes of a struggling screenwriter makes for one of the greatest films about Hollywood. Another masterpiece from Billy Wilder!

1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"Great movie. Endlessly cynical, and the killer dialogues could make anyone's day. Burt Lancaster should have won an oscar for his brilliant performance as the seedy, malevolent J.J. Hunsecker. And Tony Curtis is a tour de force on his own.I think I can watch this movie again and again."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"""You're dead, son. Get yourself buried."""

And with amazing, probably career-best performances by Burt Lancaster, Tony Curtis, and the almost movie-stealing Barbara Nichols. I loved it! I would put t up there in my favorites!"
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"This is my type of film. The two main characters are downright despicable. Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis are both amazing in this film.

1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"Like Casablanca, this is one of the great classics that even someone ""not into black and white films"" will love. The dialogue, performance, story, and cinematography are all legendary. Watch it already!!"
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,Tony Curtis is great in this surprisingly dark tale about the underworld of New York's gossip collumnists and press agents. The film features some stunning black and white photography and is very much an oft overlooked classic.
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"'Cat's in the bag and the bag's in the river.Just a flat terrible movie, but it pulses rhythmically like the beat of a drum and grows on you because of that hip, street wise dialogue you only wish you had the literate wit to say in normal conversation."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"The plot has its twists and turns, but where this film really grabbed me was in its witty dialogue and wonderful performances, especially main man Tony Curtis.Grade: A / Views: 1"
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,Absolutely brilliant.
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"Before America took capitalism for granted these guys ""looked"" bad. So it's kind of like normal assholes portrayed to look like vampires or deranged zealots. Hitchcock couldn't have made these jerks any more creepy."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"A wonderfully cool, stylish movie that dissects the sleazy world of PR and gossip masquerading as journalism. Tony Curtis is remarkable as the desperate PR guy, hungry for success and losing everything that matters as he chases it."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,LURVE Burt Lancaster
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,one of my all time favorites. Burt Lancaster rocks!
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,If you are a Lancaster fan and wish to see him at his very best-- watch this film!
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"I love this venal little movie -- what JJ Hunsecker would undoubtedly call a ""cookie full of arsenic"". Tony Curtis and Lancaster at their finest."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,Incredible performances by Curtis and Lancaster. Top it off with a freaking incredible storyline. And you have a SUCCESSful movie. Wow.
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,Burt Lancaster y Tony Curtis ofrecen unas interpretaciones devastadoras en este negro relato sobre la codicia y el deseo.
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,A great film. An intense drama superbly acted and nicely made. Tony Curtis is excellent but this is Lancaster's film. His performance is one of the all time greats - a brilliant fusion of ego and menace.
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"Every single character in this nightcrawling noir masterpiece is tainted, corrupted and compromised. Add Clifford Odets' and Ernest Lehmann's poetry-of-malice dialog and James Wong Howe's photography and it achieves a rancid perfection."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"A film noir that proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that humans of all types, not just criminals and gangsters, can be full of malice, deceit and a smooth, serpentine evil. Scary."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,Just a masterpiece. One of the tightest and sharpest scripts I've ever come across.
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,this is a movie with modern sensibilities beyond its age. strong characters and an unremorsfull plot makes this a truly vintage piece of cinema
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"Autre chef-d'oeuvre de violence psychologique, et critique impitoyable des m√É¬©dias, le tout dans un monde o√É¬π tout est corrompu et sordide, ""Sweet Smell"" a des allures de trag√É¬©dies greques, avec un arri√É¬®re-plan d'inceste assez courageux pour l'√É¬©poque. ""Match me, Sidney""."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"They simply do not make 'em like this any more. Razor sharp dialogue, perfectly delivered performances -- the kind of film Network, Wall Street and Boiler Room could only hope to aspire to, but never match."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,What could be better than seeing that irritating cop from Adam 12 framed for smoking the devil weed? Just kidding...this is the best movie of all time.
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"Excellent film-noir without guns, reminded me of Night and the City with its quick pace largely dialog-based conflict. Also, pretty clear commentary on McCarthyism."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,a razor blade of cynicism and human nature at it's worst...
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"Lancaster is a slimeball, Greatly acted film by the entire cast."

1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,Burt and Tony in a stone-cold classic. The line when Burt comes out of the night club and says 'I love this dirty town' is just perfect. They really don't make 'em like this anymore.
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"stylised dialogue done the RIGHT way, none of this ""honest to blog"" bullshit."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"A true classic! I've already cast the remake.. Clooney as JJ Hunsecker, and Christian Slater as Sidney Falco"
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"Oy, this is a nasty film. If you think humanity is the shit, watch this to cure what ails you. If he were alive, I would want to meet Burt Lancaster, except he scares me."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"I LOVE this movie - dialogue is fantastic, look is all noir, the weird unspoken unconsumated incestuousness on Hunsecker's part in a 50's movie, all the evil motivations of the people, & probably the best performance of Tony Curtis' life."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"Tony Curtis is amazing in this movie; the cinematography is beautiful; the Jazz angle is silly but WOW, what a movie"
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,J.J. Hunsecker is one of the great movie villains.
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"Great chemistry and performances from Lancaster and Curtis, awesome dialogue by Clifford Odets plus gourgeously done NY nightlife tableau."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,It only gets better with every viewing. One of the darkest scripts ever to surface.
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"When it comes to noir, here's the most venomous of them all. Lancaster and Curtis go head-to-head spewing acid like it's going out of style. It pulls no punches, hits about as hard as Ace in the Hole, and features one of the most brilliant scripts in film history."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"Stayed good, stayed sharp, stayed brutal, didn't stay staid."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"Sharp like a knife that kills. This movie bites, scars, scares; tells you who you are. This is one movie I watched on my knees and never blinking!"
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"Probably the best script in movie history. Just poisonous. It's honest and dark and brillant. And funny, deliciously darkly funny."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,One of a kind in basically everyway. This movie is like a well-placed dagger.
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"Unfortunately, I've yet to come across a situation in my own life where ""Match me, Sydney"" would be both germane and pants-wettingly scary. Also, this movie is weirdly all about race without ever mentioning it."

1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,Some of the best dialogue ever written.
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"This acerbic and sharp-tongued film noir fills no punches. Burt Lancaster as the newspaper columnist who can make or break careers, and Tony Curtis as his sniveling helper are both extremely quotable."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,Film Nior and the dark side of Hollywood.This film was roughly based on Walter Winchell. It is seedy as it gets in a fifties movie and goes one better than LA Cofidential.

1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,Watch this movie for the dialogue. It has some of the very best stylized stuff you'll ever see on screen. Both Lancaster and Curtis play scum but in very different types. Evokes a different time with alot of style.

1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,Match me Sidney....Burt Lancaster and Tony Curtis are dope incarnate in this film..plus the added value of a great soundtrack AND Chico Hamilton making a cabaret performance. This is a great film.
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"Intensity on a stick. Thats what best describes this film, the people in it, and the writing. Exceedingly dark and filled with amazing performances. Lancaster and Curtis steal the show as equally cruel men who utterly despise yet need eachother."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,Maybe the best dialogue film of all time.
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,One of the best movies ever made. J.J. Hunsecker is one of the ickiest people ever.
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"Sweet Smell of Success delivers a very important message: Powerful people will do anything to suppress the truth and in a dirty city, being good is being stupid. The peculiar bond between J.J and Falco makes us love this movie."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,I got to see this in a screenwriting class and now I own it. It's a rare gem and is as badass as any movie today without using a million f-words.
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,"One of my favorite works of noir. I really enjoy the stark potrayl of New York and show buisness which is usally just seen in musicals during this period. Really enjoyed everyone (Curtis, Lancaster...) especially Martin Milner in a pre Jack Webb role."
1.0,sweet_smell_of_success,Hoo hoo! Burt Lancaster is soooo badassed in this!

1.0,double_indemnity,"The greatest of all the classic film noirs!!! All the elements are here... the femme fatale who seduces & corrupts the boring loner, the flashbacks, the dark atmosphere, the whiplash dialogue, the sharp lighting contrasts. An amazing film that really sinks its teeth into the viewer!!!!"
1.0,double_indemnity,as twisty/turny as it gets
1.0,double_indemnity,"Fantastic film noir, in every sense. Classy and awesome."
1.0,double_indemnity,A beautiful film. Perfection. Whatever you do...don't watch the seventies made for tv movie. watch the original...it remains one of the best I've ever seen.

0.0,double_indemnity,omg... I thought I was going to stab my ears as the movie was narrated throughout... I did like the film noir cinematography but the dialogue was not my favorite.
1.0,double_indemnity,"One of the best Film Noir ever made such a Twisted Story, Dooming Darkness, Bombastic Soundtrack and Charming Actors and it's always a Pleasure too see that Little Robinson Fella with his Cigar in the Mouth"

1.0,double_indemnity,"While it holds a strong atmosphere of being the best film noir, Double Indemnity has brilliant actors showing a story of evil love."
1.0,double_indemnity,"Extraordinary motion picture, perfect is the right word to describe it. A lot of suspense, intrigue in a perfect film noir in every way."
1.0,double_indemnity,"Classic film with a excellent cast, plot and acting. Crafty, enjoyable and suspenseful film noir filled with anti-heroes, mystery, morals, and just good all-round entertainment."

1.0,double_indemnity,"dua kata, Noir mahakarya..."
1.0,double_indemnity,"Great original film noir. When I first saw it (after I was exposed to all our modern pop culture) I thought ""so this is where all that came from."" Too classic. Also happily unpredictable."
1.0,double_indemnity,Billy Wilder's extraordinarily dark film noir masterpiece. A pitch black atmosphere and brilliant cast led by Barbara Stanwyck at her most deliciously evil make the film a must see.
1.0,double_indemnity,Fantastic movie... Quite absorbing and thrilling. I am quite impressed by the story and directing.
1.0,double_indemnity,The perfect film noir. Barbara Stanwyck is my all-time favortie femme fatale. I just heart her period.

1.0,double_indemnity,Excellent film noir from Billy Wilder.
1.0,double_indemnity,"The greatest film noir ever made (in my humble opinion). MacMurray, Stanwyck, and Robinson go great work, and Wilder's direction is exemplary."
1.0,double_indemnity,Maybe the best Film-Noir of all-time. Many suspenseful moments keep the viewer on the edge of his seat from start to finish. Avoid the 1973 remake at all costs. Richard Crenna and Samantha Eggar are awful at trying to re-create the sexual tension between Fred MacMurray and Barbra Stanwyck.
1.0,double_indemnity,"Absolutely incredible writing. Although Wilder and Chandler did not get along... at all, they produced an incredible screenplay and what has been named the best Film Noir picture of all time. ""Hold on to that cheap cigar,"" cause this is a classic you cannot miss."
1.0,double_indemnity,"Absolutely fantastic. MacMurray and Stanwyck excell in their performances. Though in my opinion, Edward G. Robinson steals the show, even though he plays a bit part. A great example of Film Noir. Possibly the greatest."

1.0,double_indemnity,"A perfect noir. Great characters, ultra-witty dialogue, and a plot that seems predictable, but doesn't go where I expected."

1.0,double_indemnity,A good film noir to start with if you are just a beginner.
1.0,double_indemnity,This is a fantastic film noir that deserves all the acclaims it has received. Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck do an excellent job of their roles but the shining here is the great Edward G. Robinson.
0.0,double_indemnity,"I realize that Noir means that morals and values are up for debate, but I didn't really care for anyone in this movie. It was very well done, and I feel that it succeeded in what in originally intended to accomplish...but Double Indemnity is just not the movie for me."
1.0,double_indemnity,"One of the top ten films of all time. More wit than a comedians convention, more naked lust than a WI calendar & lines fresher than just picked fruit.Clever, sassy & sexy."
1.0,double_indemnity,"Misty, melodramatic and hilarious."
1.0,double_indemnity,Just wow! What a suspenseful story!
1.0,double_indemnity,"As the saying goes, this one is straight down the line."

1.0,double_indemnity,"It was amazing! It's like CSI from the 1940's! It's also a lot like the Post Man Always Rings Twice, but not as long which I appreciate. Barbara Stanwyck is the ultimate Film Noir Femme Fetal."
1.0,double_indemnity,By far the best Film Noir ever made. Billy Wilder's dialog is masterful in this film. Barbara Stanwick is gorgeous and Fred MacMurray is dry as ever. A MUST SEE by all.
1.0,double_indemnity,Barbara Stanwyck is the ultimate femme fatale in this classic film noir.
1.0,double_indemnity,A superb movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat with its interesting characters and engrossing storyline. One of the first film noirs and it sets the bar pretty high.
1.0,double_indemnity,"Holly fuck, this film left me jaws wide open. America's top ten film noir, and my no 1. A tale of lust, murder, and betrayal, showing that even the best of plans can go array."
1.0,double_indemnity,Archetype meme du film noir
1.0,double_indemnity,Five star super intelligent film. Done with class and style.
1.0,double_indemnity,"One of the best crime dramas from any era. Remade several times in one form or another. Surprisingly, several of those films also hit the mark! But there's nothing to improve on the original. Fantastic dialogue. One of My 45 Perfect Movies."
1.0,double_indemnity,Interesting story. Good classic film noir. Go see this movie. Two thumbs up!
1.0,double_indemnity,"With a stellar cast and an excellent screenplay, this classic noir is one of the primary reasons we have so many great thrillers today. Edward G. Robinson and Fred MacMurray are perfect, but Barbara Stanwyck is just plain wicked."
1.0,double_indemnity,this is the noir that all other noirs wish they could be like
1.0,double_indemnity,Excellent movie. Film noir at its finest.
1.0,double_indemnity,"fantastic film. normally I'd be complaining about a film with relatively no subtext, completely story driven, but I don't know that I've ever seen a story so perfectly told from beginning to end. The only thing that comes close on a pure storytelling level is The Shawshank Redemption."
1.0,double_indemnity,The original film noir.
1.0,double_indemnity,"Absolutely great movie. My first ""film noir"" flick and this was definitely the perfect choice as an introduction to this genre."

1.0,double_indemnity,"Terrific story, amazing acting, love Stanwyck, film noir period piece that is well worth more than one viewing."
1.0,double_indemnity,"Freaking amazing. It's tempting to say it's one of the best dramas ever, but it's more like one of the best MOVIES ever, period."
1.0,double_indemnity,"I can watch this again and again, always entertaining"
1.0,double_indemnity,"Billy Wilder is one of my big movie heroes and Double Indemnity is one of his very best films. I hadn't watched this one in years till it came on TCM and I found myself just as mesmorized as when I first saw it as a kid. Anyone studying film, especially screenwriters, should not miss this one."
1.0,double_indemnity,"CINE NEGRO en su maxima expresion. Wilder maneja el suspense a sus anchas, gracias a un guion, unos dialogos y unas secuencias inolvidables...""No oia mis propios pasos, eran los de un hombre muerto..."""
1.0,double_indemnity,This is definitely one of my favorite noirs now. The film was really suspenseful and felt kinda like a Hitchcock movie.
1.0,double_indemnity,"""Love and murder at first sight"" Fred MacMurray is sunk by his crave for money and for the enticing Barbara Stanwyck. Amoral, snappy and tense exercise of suspense; and probably Miss Stanwyck's finest hour. Rounded noir perfection."
1.0,double_indemnity,"What's amazing about this movie is that it had me sweating and biting my nails as much as any contemporary movie could, if not more. Plus it was extremely badass. Also well lit, acted, and structured."
1.0,double_indemnity,Classic of the 1940s film noir genre. It is also a mystery movie at its best.
1.0,double_indemnity,"There is a reason why Billy Wilder is my favorite director ever--this movie is it. This is the definitive film noir classic. The story and interpretation are as fresh today as they were in 1944. Riveting, engaging, and knock-your-socks-off chemistry between MacMurray and Stanwyck. Whoah!"
1.0,double_indemnity,My quintessential Noir story. Chandler's dialogue is pure ear candy here and with more twists than a five-foot curly frie it's fresh each and every time I watch. So damn good it should be made illegal.
1.0,double_indemnity,"It doesn't get any better with MacMurray and Stanwyck, so combined with Robinson and that hard-as-marble Chandler/Wilder dialogue, well, it's just over."
1.0,double_indemnity,"Line for line, this is arguably the best dialogue ever filmed. And any argument would be short, loud and probably contain the word sh@thead."
1.0,double_indemnity,"This deliciously evil and passionate tale of greed and betrayal is perhaps one of the darkest yet finest pieces in film noir form. Stanwyck shines like a beacon, but it is Wilder√¢??s direction that is the genre√¢??s trailblazer."
1.0,double_indemnity,"If I could give it a sixth star just for Edward G. Robinson, I would."
1.0,double_indemnity,The greatest noir film ever made!
1.0,double_indemnity,"This is one classic that certainly lives up to it's reputation. It is a thrilling noir that is expertly written and shot, and has fantastic performances by all of the leads, particularly Edward G. Robinson. I highly recommend this to anyone looking to appreciate some good classic American cinema."
1.0,double_indemnity,great movie with funny dialogue. Still want to try to do that thing he does with the matches.
1.0,double_indemnity,Very entertaining on more than one level. I wish they still made movies in black and white because it really captures the air of mystery so much better.
1.0,double_indemnity,"- 8:30 tomorrow evening, then?- That's what I suggested.- Will you be here too?- I guess so. I usually am.- Same chair, same perfume, same anklet?- I wonder if I know what you mean.- I wonder if you wonder... Jeez!!!"
1.0,double_indemnity,"You cannot go wrong with Billy Wilder and this film proves it. Babara Stanwyck is, as always, deliciously evil and sultry. Top notch film noir."
1.0,double_indemnity,The Essential film noir
1.0,double_indemnity,"So, so good. Barbara Stanwyck smolders as Phyllis Dietrichson, but the relationship between Fred MacMurry as Walter Neff and Edward G. Robinson as Keyes is the heart of the film. One of the best examples of the noir genre."
1.0,double_indemnity,"If like me, you grew up watching reruns of My Three Sons, film noir Fred MacMurray will be a revelation to you. This excellent noir features MacMurray as a hard drinking, tough-guy insurance salesman ensnared into a murder/insurance fraud scheme by the femme-iest and fatale-iest of femme fatales."
1.0,double_indemnity,"Walter: You'll be here too?Phyllis: I guess so, I usually am.Walter: Same chair, same perfume, same anklet?Phyllis: I wonder if I know what you mean.Walter: I wonder if you wonder."

1.0,double_indemnity,The paragon of film noir.
1.0,double_indemnity,"The quintessential film noir, full of double-crossings, 40's lingo, and enough smoking to give you cancer. Suspenseful all the way through, starting with the opening credits, carried by a dramatic score. In a word, ""Timeless."""
1.0,double_indemnity,"Incredible. So gripping, stylish and written to perfection. Certainly up there with The Big Sleep, Sunset Blvd. and Body Heat (may not be as classic but a personal fave) as the crowning glory of Film Noir for me."
1.0,double_indemnity,"""I wonder if you wonder..."" Best. Movie. Line. Ever."
1.0,double_indemnity,"A well written and gripping thriller-noir that captures your attention from the opening scene, and won't let you go."

1.0,double_indemnity,I never realized how fucking SEXY Fred MacMurray was until this movie. My Three Sons does him no justice. Oh yeah the movie's awesome too!
1.0,double_indemnity,"dated, but still compelling on it's own. The atypical type casting is brilliant, and as the standard bearer of Noir, this is must see. Wilder broke the rules he so well understood to create something referenced by a gazillion other films ever since."
1.0,double_indemnity,"Great performances, crisp dialogue, perfect lighting and cinematography and Billy Wilder as director make this the best Film Noir movie ever made."
1.0,double_indemnity,"Great piece of film noir. Anyone interested in getting into noir, this would be a good starting movie for you."
1.0,double_indemnity,"This is a perfectly executed movie, in the sense that no shot or scene is too long or short. Everything falls into place and just works together...perfectly. Add that to the great cineamatography, subtle yet fine performances and gripping plot, and you have a masterpiece!"
1.0,double_indemnity,Damn thats a good movie! The amount of thought that went into both the story and the film making is something that I don't normally see in an old film like this. (Your Hate Mail Here).
1.0,double_indemnity,The most fun you can have with film noir. The dialogue is so snappy and sexy cool you just want to put on a trenchcoat and fedora and go get some information out of someone.
1.0,double_indemnity,"truely of the greatest film noirs of all time, the characters are flawed and corrupt and the dialogue is one of the best written i ahve ever seen, a must see!"
1.0,double_indemnity,A fabulous film noir. MacMurray and Stanwyck are incredible. Billy Wilder keeps you guessing till the very end.
1.0,double_indemnity,One of my top films of all time. The scene wiith the first meeting between Walter and Phyllis is some of the finest writing in movie history.
1.0,double_indemnity,"I ate this up, but my wife thought it was a little corny. What can I say? I love film noir. Plenty of classic crime drama dialogue and voiceovers that the genre is famous for."

1.0,double_indemnity,"THE quintessential film noir with a sharp, witty script. Brilliant."
1.0,double_indemnity,"The definitive film noir; dark and narcissistic. The opening is one of the best you will ever see, and the performances are perfect; MacMurray as the weak insurance man, and Stanwyk as the femme fatale who brings about his downfall."
1.0,double_indemnity,"A flippin' fabulous example of film noir! Also...screenplay by Raymond Chandler, of the hard-boiled detective novels about Philip Marlowe. Awesome........definitely a must-see movie."
1.0,double_indemnity,Excellent film noir directed by Billy Wilder. Barbara Stanwyck plays the classic femme fatale pitch perfect and Fred MacMurray carries as the leading man caught in her web wonderfully. Keeps you on edge until the the end. One of the great all time classics.
1.0,double_indemnity,We had this in my film class in college. We watched one scene and I was hooked. Fred MacMurray stole my heart with his character and his lines. Classic Film Noir!

1.0,city_lights,"Despite some gaps in logic such as the cure, and the eccentric millionaire parts, this film contains the most tender romance in the history of film, and thus, rightly deserves its masterpiece status. It is Chaplin's crowning glory, and possibly the greatest ending in the history of film."
1.0,city_lights,"(SPOILER ALERT) This film gave me another definition of comedy: ""A misunderstanding blown way out of proportion"" -- this is evident when our beloved Tramp is mistaken for a burglar, even though his millionaire friend gave him one grand to give to his leading lady."
1.0,city_lights,"Falling in love with a blind flower girl and befriending a suicidal millionaire are just a few of the Tramp's antics in this fun Chaplin classic. Although the plot and resolution can seem a little far-fetched and ridiculous, I would argue this to be Charlie Chaplin's finest work."

1.0,city_lights,"Another Chaplin masterpiece. What 'Modern Times' stands out of its humor, this one stand out in its charm. It is oh so beautiful, when the ending more classic then the movie itself. Chaplin's themes are totally universal, this will be loved for centuries to come."
1.0,city_lights,I can't think of a happier or sweeter ending to any movie than the one in City Lights.
1.0,city_lights,"this is the best silent film ever made, near-flawless."
1.0,city_lights,"The epitome of Humanist Cinema. Anyone who can get through the final frames of this Film with dry eyes should undergo a drastic reevaluation of his/her life. For if it be so, something has been torn from his/her soul somewhere along the way --- possibly never to be regained."
1.0,city_lights,"If ever a comedian pushed the limits of a genre that gets little to no critical recognition, it was Chaplin. This film sums up all of the greatest possibilites you can acheive when you dangerously mix comedy and sentiment. He pulls it off beautifully in this film."
1.0,city_lights,"A combination of classic filmmaking technique, comic invention, and human beauty. More sweet and uplifting than most anything I've ever seen. Truly a beautiful film. And it's freaking hilarious."
1.0,city_lights,Probably my all time favorite film
1.0,city_lights,"Ladies,This is how you make a romantic comedy."
1.0,city_lights,"A masterpiece. Chaplin's greatest film. The ending is one of the most phenomenal moments I have ever seen in a film, and was one of the few times I experienced true magic watching a movie. A work of absolute genius."
1.0,city_lights,"The absolute best ending of any movie I have ever seen. This movie is funny, entertaining, sweet & sentimental. It totally blew me away."
1.0,city_lights,Great! classic and a must see far better than most films today
1.0,city_lights,"It the legend, no one can argue, this is an act of a true thespian, par non"
1.0,city_lights,the best of the Chaplin films.
1.0,city_lights,I'm revisiting all the Chaplin films for the first time since watching them with my grandma as a kid. This is a magical revelation. It's amazing how much emotion you can produce without a single word.
1.0,city_lights,The last scene slew me...
1.0,city_lights,Timeless Romantic Comedy
1.0,city_lights,"One of the best movies ever. Totally groundbreaking at that time. Chaplin is capable to blend different sublime sketches into one harmonious storyline. Every scene,every part fluidly rolls into the other, the acting is perfect and hilarious."
1.0,city_lights,Charlie Chaplin can express more with a look than most can with a torrent of words. Subtlety at its finest.
1.0,city_lights,"see it, we are watching a legend here"
1.0,city_lights,Chaplin's masterpiece. City Lights remains 77 years later one of the most moving films I've ever seen and one of the great movie love stories. Chaplin remains one of the funniest actors in cinema and his films remain some of the most perfect and sentimental.
1.0,city_lights,I loved it!! It was so great. Chaplin never fails to get a laugh.
1.0,city_lights,OBRA MAESTRAAAAAAAAAAAAA
1.0,city_lights,"Absolutely brilliant. Heart wrenching, hilarious, such a prime example of what film can really be, so early in the medium's youth."
1.0,city_lights,"One of the best movies. Sweet, romantic, funny, silly, kooky. . .just superb"
1.0,city_lights,Fully lived up to its reputation.
1.0,city_lights,One of the most wonderful films I've ever seen.
1.0,city_lights,Chaplin's first masterpience
1.0,city_lights,"Best Movie ever made...the comedy is funnier; the romance is more genuine; the pathos is pathos-ier... if you get a chance, see it with an audience."
1.0,city_lights,"City Lights is the #1 Romantic Comedy according to AFI and I agree hands down. If you enjoy the genre this masterpiece is a must see. It will make you laugh, cry and it will linger in your thoughts long after watching it. How many movies can do that?? Not many."
1.0,city_lights,I don't know if a movie can ever get any better than this.
1.0,city_lights,so sweet and funny. it's so fun watching this movie over again and noticing all of the things that have been referenced in so many other films and tv shows.
1.0,city_lights,He he. Morsom film som m√• sees. Ikke bli skremt av at det er en stumfilm.
1.0,city_lights,Charles Chaplin is a movie-making genius. I dare you not to laugh!
1.0,city_lights,Deffinently one of Chaplin's Greatest films.
1.0,city_lights,I think this is Chaplin's best film. Chaplin is at his best and the emotional roller coaster ride you go on in this movie leaves you exhausted by the end (in a good way). You can't help but feel for The Tramp as he does everything he can to help this blind flower girl.
1.0,city_lights,"A la fin, quand la jolie fleuriste d√É¬©couvre l'identit√É¬© de son bienfaiteur, impossible de ne pas fondre en larmes."
1.0,city_lights,"Beautiful set pieces. The blind girl. The Tramp. And the flowers. A great romantic delight from start to end. The prizefight part is one of the early comedies greatest achievement. And the final scene is just hearbreaking, despite the fact that the couple find each other in the end."
1.0,city_lights,The best Charlie Chaplin film!
1.0,city_lights,My favorite Chaplin performance and one of his best ever. Both poignant and prodigious in the era of Silent Films. An ardent display of great pantomime comedy and solemn romance that has an ending that will make you reach for a tissue.
1.0,city_lights,"The ending of this movie says it all. If you can watch it and not shed a tear you are in need of a doctor to check for a pulse. This movie is moving, funny, and a true classic."
1.0,city_lights,"This film just makes me feel overwhelmingly happy! A rare occurance, and probably the only romance I will ever like."
1.0,city_lights,Wow. This is something special.
1.0,city_lights,Easily one of the best movies ever made. =]
1.0,city_lights,Great movie. For a silent film it manages to have humor and romance blended in well together. The final scene is impeccable.
1.0,city_lights,Definitely one of the best endings to any film I've seen.
1.0,city_lights,"Not only is the film funny, but it contains a great measure of poignancy. End scene is *the* most moving in cinema."
1.0,city_lights,Classic silent cinema from a great pantomime. The resolution with City Lights may be one of the best in cinema. A funny and charming narrative with the beautiful Virginia Cherril.
1.0,city_lights,"Bellissimo. La scena finale √® la pi√π commovente della storia del cinema. E' divertentissimo, ma √® anche drammatico, √® romantico ma √® anche impegnato, la musica (dello stesso Chaplin) √® incredibile; c'√® tutto, manca solo il sonoro ma non ci si fa proprio caso..."
1.0,city_lights,"One of those shows which directors repeatedly pay homage to, and deservingly so. The acting, comic timing, visual gags, and the lovely lovely ending make this timeless. And the boxing match is arguably one of the best comic scenes ever."
1.0,city_lights,Chaplin's most emotionally rich film. The final scene is a tearjerker.
1.0,city_lights,"This seems to be considered Chaplin's ""masterpiece"" by many, but my favorite is still Modern Times."
1.0,city_lights,"La mejor historia de amor se cuenta en silencio. Definitivamente una de las peli¬≠culas que uno debe ver para decir ""yo he vivido""."
1.0,city_lights,Absolutely priceless...This film set the bar for all romantic comedies to come and very few (if any) have managed to live up to it.
1.0,city_lights,"tho i still think ""Modern Times"" is Chaplin's best...this one nearly ties it.....an absolute must see..the scene where the cat knocks the pot onto Chaplin's head while he sniffs the girl's flower is HILARIOUS...also the boxing match-PRICELESS..and then of course the tearjerker ending =masterpiece"
1.0,city_lights,Beautiful! I haven't been able to stop thinking about it.
1.0,city_lights,"Whatever superlative you like, use it."
1.0,city_lights,"It may be a silent movie, but the movie speaks volumes."
1.0,city_lights,A silent movie so good that even my 9 and 5 year olds love it.
1.0,city_lights,simply amazing. the ending truly is one of the greatest in cinema
1.0,city_lights,"Excellent Charles Chaplin film. Behind 'Modern Times' and 'The Great Dictator' for me, but it was amazing. One of the simplest definitions of a romantic comedy before the genre lost its touch along the way."
1.0,city_lights,"If the ending doesn't make you cry, you have no soul.Endlessly brilliant, funny, and so delightful; no matter how many times I watch it, it remains fresh, and further proves the genius of Charles Chaplin."
1.0,city_lights,My favorite Chaplin film. Everyone should see this movie about Chaplin's love for a blind flower girl and his attempts to get money from a drunken millionaire to restore her eyesight. The boxing scene is classic Chaplin and the ending is sure to bring a tear to your eye.
1.0,city_lights,THE LAST MINUTE.OH MY GOD.
1.0,city_lights,Chaplin's best film. An absolute joy to watch. One of the most poignant love stories as the Tramp tries to woo a blind flower girl. The ending is pure gold and brings a tear to my eye.
1.0,city_lights,"Arguably Chaplin's greatest silent, ""City Lights"" is a true masterpiece. With the universal message that love is blind, ""City Lights"" is a comedy that could make you cry (if you're the type--I personally never cry during movies)."
1.0,city_lights,"Saw this in my film class and enjoyed it quite a bit. Charlie Chaplin was hilarious, but the scenes with his crush were what stood out for me. Just a great movie overall."
1.0,city_lights,"Perfection in pantomime. Absolutely the best film ending, ever!"
1.0,city_lights,Beautiful romantic comedy
1.0,city_lights,Funny and sweet. A beautiful film all around.
1.0,city_lights,Comic gold. Charlie Chaplin was a genius. Absolutley splendid.

1.0,city_lights,"One Of Chaplin''s Best films, amusing comedy sets up SPECTACULAR ending"
1.0,city_lights,Hilarious as well as touching; the ending is pure perfection.
1.0,city_lights,"Funny, touching, brilliant. One of the greatest film endings ever. I love this movie."
1.0,city_lights,One of the best Chaplins of all time. Also was listed as the top romantic movie according to the AFI. The boxing scene is also one of Chaplin's most classic+hilarious gags. Just a phenominal piece of movie making.
1.0,city_lights,I'm a big fan of Chaplin and hadn't seen it yet. When I saw recently that it was chosen as AFI's top romantic comedy of all-time I figured I was really missing out. I was right. It's a sweet story with great performances.
1.0,city_lights,His final smile is priceless. Chaplin shows more romantic passion here than most other movies without the benefit of a single spoken word. Timeless.
1.0,city_lights,One of my absolute favorite movies.
1.0,city_lights,Nobody does it better.
1.0,city_lights,Beautiful story... still fresh!

1.0,city_lights,Toda la pelicula y en especial la escena donde la cieguita confunde al vagabundo con un rico son geniales
1.0,city_lights,"AFI recently named this the greatest romantic comedy of all time. I agree. This movie combines pathos and comedy in a completely unique way. Probably the best final scene of all time in a movie. If you only see one silent film in your life, this would be the one to see. Long live the Tramp!!!"
1.0,city_lights,A very cute love story!
1.0,city_lights,One of the greatest movies ever made!

1.0,city_lights,amazing funny and much better than many films today! very original
1.0,city_lights,"Chaplin, come ha fatto Benigni con LA VITA E' BELLA, riesce a toccarci in cuore cosi' puramente attraverso la commedia. Il suo personaggio Il Tramp e' puro e sincero in ogni sua azione di tenereza, pericolo, malinteso. Alla fine di questo film, lei veramente riesce a vedere lui!"
1.0,city_lights,The most touching scene in movie history is at the end of this film...if you are not moved to tears when you see it you must not have a heart

1.0,city_lights,"Chaplin is the city lights. He saved the millionaire and helped the blind girl. The irony is that the millionaire never recognize him and the girl cannot see.  At closing, the girl reunited Chaplin via a touch of hand. How sentimental."
1.0,city_lights,Uma das melhores atua√ß√µes do Chaplin!
1.0,city_lights,Chaplin's masterpiece.
1.0,city_lights,A very good classic black and white movie. It is sad and hopeful. I would really like to know what's happening AFTER the end. (My daughter's favourite part is the boxing game. She is 5 years and loves Charlie Chaplin.)

1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,"One of the most influential, epic, moving, and understanding war films that I have ever seen. It shows the value of innocence and how war will tear that innocence apart so easily. This is one of the best films ever to be made."
1.0,lawrence_of_arabia,"The film that David Lean and Peter O'Tool will no doubt be remembered for; it's a mysterious wonder that doesn't grow dated, and treats the protagonist as a human, instead of a contemporary movie hero."

1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,This is about as perfect of a movie as you'll ever find. It was made in 1948 and holds up better than most films half its age. Adventure films today don't even come close. Highly recommend this one.

Bogie rocks as always and Tim Holt is a striking and likable second-fiddle who isn't as interesting only becomes he doesn't succumb to greed. Walter Huston steals the show though as the smartest, and funniest, of the trio."

1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"If all you've seen of Humphrey Bogart is Casablanca, it's easy to overlook the fact that he was as well known for playing villains on the big screen as good guys. This film certainly qualifies as one of his villainous roles. An interesting character study and well worth the watch."

1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,A classic so ahead of its time. A deep and brilliant story that is as mythical as it is realistic. I feel it's Bogart's best acting performance ever and the movie feels so incredible real. This is one of the best classics of all time.
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"The arc of Bogart's character's movement into paranoia and madness is brilliant. I defy anyone to maintain their civility when there's so much gold at stake.

1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,This could be the greatest film of all time. It totally exposes the worst in the human experience and the irony is fabulous. Huston has outdone himself in this movie and Bogie should have won an academy award for this. Fred C. Dobbs is the quintessential Bogart character.

1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,I loved this movie. Great acting and a classic story that shows where greed can take a man. A fantastic cinematic adventure.
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,Badges? Just kidding. The combination of Huston's unfailing eye for directing along with Bogart's best performance makes for a piece of art to be reckoned with.
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"Whenever I think of how good people can become corrupted and distorted by money and power, The Treasure Of Sierra Madre comes to mind. The Godfather is this movie's only rival when it comes to the story of a honest man's descent into evil.Definitely worth seeing."
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,Not Bogart's best film (that'd be Casablanca) but probably his best performance. A lesson on greed and mistrust that has timeless resonance.
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,Bogart blew my mind. Watching his mind becoming corrupt over the idea of getting this money was a trip. I'm a big fan of movies about greed destroying men cause its so fascinating to watch. And this was one of the first to do it really well. John Huston is a hell of a director not just an actor.

1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"Bogart gives a superb performance in this sharp, well-executed thriller. It's been made predictable through countless imitations (including a SIMPSONS episode), but it still works."
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,Bogart never ceases to amaze me. This is arguably his best performance.What a ballsy script for 1948... or at least violent. And possibly one of the few films of the era without some sort of romance in it.

1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,Without a doubt the best movie ever made about greed and its accompanying paranoia. Humphrey Bogart was never better than as Fred C. Dobbs. This is a classic movie that everyone should see. Supremely entertaining!
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"Bogart usually annoys me, but he was perfect as the insane paranoid greedy psycho. This movie is awesome as it successfully shows how even the best man can be changed by money."
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,an allegory of greed
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"A film that proves Bogey can really act, and not just be the same tough cool guy. Also a great story about the greed that lives within each man."
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"Classic Movie.. Talks abt ""Men & their Greed for money""..."
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,I revisited this film recently. It's still one of the great adventure stories but at the same a fascinating morality play on the corrupting nature of greed. Humphrey Bogart gives one of his career best performances in this one. His descent into madness in nothing short of superb.
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"We don't need no stinking badges! No, seriously, this film will rock your socks off. Keep an eye out for Walter Huston's crazyman dance and maniacal giggling, he completely outdoes himself and upstages Bogey."
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,Perfect for a contempory remake. My Dad made me watch this so many times when I was a kid. Great picture about jealousy and greed.
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,I remember watching this as a kid and it still impresses me. Watch it and peel away the layers.
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,One of the best treasure movies of all time. John Huston and Humphrey Bogart score once again in this brilliant classic.
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"Bogart's Finest Performance . In the year of the Westerns ,everyone should see this classic ."
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"""The Pardoner's Tale"" in distinctly American clothing, this is another Bogey favorite of mine. Until I saw ""Nashville,"" this was my all-time favorite movie. It's still up there on the top shelf."
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,Best Bogart movie ever!
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,Fantastic. The treasure is found right when they get there- and the rest of the adventure is trying to hang on to both it and their sanity. Fantastic tale- not sure why Bogie's top credit (probably because he's the man) this one belongs to Tim Holt hands down.
0.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,A boring over rated hollywood golden age peice of shit.
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,One of my top 5 favorites.
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"What more could be said about this classic? In my opinion, movies simply do not get any better than this."
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,Humphrey Bogart's best film and a tale well worth telling. They just don't make 'em like they used to. This is probably the best movie that searches into the evolution of materialism and the downfall of the greedy.
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,"Hard to classify adventure movie, one of Bogie's best performances. Great human drama that hits at the dark core of humanity in some chilling scenes. In its quiet way, the film builds slowly to a surprising and darkly ironic climax that is unforgettable."
1.0,treasure_of_the_sierra_madre,great portrait of the corruptability of men

1.0,once_upon_a_time_in_the_west,"Bronson replaces Eastwood and is the fucking balls. Morricone's soundtrack especially 'Man with Harmonica', the opening scene, that final showdown and a smoking hot Claudia Cardinale. Jason Robards offeres up good support and Henry Fonda is a right nasty cunt."
