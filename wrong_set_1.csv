0.0,moana_2016,"Moana brings song and cheer and glee with a tidal baptism into paganism. Due to its apologetic breadth of revere for the occult, this may be Disney's darkest film to date.",1289
0.0,1011615-king_kong,"This is one of the few films where the remake is more entertaining, simply for the fact that King Kong is less of a joke and is the big monster (without the noticeable strings on the cardboard tower) that everyone fears yet loves.",1644

1.0,no_end_in_sight,"A staggeringly skilled look at the many, many mistakes made by the Bush Administration from the fall of Baghdad on. THIS is the type of movie that should be making money at the box office and winning awards instead of biased propaganda-fests like Fahrenheit 9/11.",28431
