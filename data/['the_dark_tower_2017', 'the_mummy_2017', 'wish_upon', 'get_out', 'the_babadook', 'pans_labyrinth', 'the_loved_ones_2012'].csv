0.0,I painfully made it through the whole movie. It is now on the top ten worst movie list. I found it boring and annoying. The acting resembled something you'd watch with a homemade movie but quite possibly worse. I do not recommend this movie for anyone.
0.0,It's as bad as the reviews indicate. I laughed once. The charisma of the two stars is completely wasted.
0.0,"This film is absolutely terrible. The script is awful, and so are the performances. There isn't even a single funny moment. Skip this one at all costs!"

0.0,"I only saw the first 10 minutes of this movie, but that was such a sad experience I had to turn it off. A waste of Witherspoon's talent. Wish I could give this 0 stars."
1.0,Reese and Sofia did amazing in this movie
0.0,It's a female buddy road trip picture and it's terrible. Sofia Vergara's amazing melons are about the only thing worth watching and even they can't redeem this shitslopper. Don't waste your time.
0.0,Really bad version of the heat
1.0,"loved, loved, loved it.Those two together are so hilarious. I would watch it a million Times and laugh beginning to end each time."
0.0,"Hot Pursuit is like a really long, egregiously unfunny SNL skit. Reese Witherspoon was just nominated for an Oscar for Wild. Watch that movie instead. Steer VERY CLEAR of Hot Pursuit. It's not worth it."
0.0,The best part was when the ex-Eastenders actor appeared
0.0,"This is one of the worst comedies I've seen this year, and it's definitely one of the worst movies I've seen this year! 0.5/5 stars."
0.0,This movie is a waste of your time and money. STAY AWAY
0.0,"This is exactly what you do not want to see in a female comedy. With the ""humor"" rooted in depicting women doing things women do not traditionally, there is a limit on what can be seen as funny. Hot Pursuit finds this limit almost immediately."

1.0,"People need to calm down and just laugh! I have never laughed so hard during a movie! Me an my friend both agree it was hilarious. Not every movie has to be Oscar worthy, sometimes it's fun to laugh at goofy comedy. Stop analyzing and have fun! That's what this movie is about."
0.0,"Possibly the worst tripe I have had the displeasure of watching this year. The jokes do not work, the chemistry between the leads feels forced and flat! The script and plot are god awful ..:: avoid like the plague"
0.0,bad don't waste your time
0.0,Terrible movie. I'll never get the time back I just wasted watching it.
0.0,A candidate for worst film in 2015. Reese Witherspoon and Sofia Vegara do a lot of acting in this over-the-top attempt at comedy. Too bad it is the wrong kind of acting. There are painfully unfunny scene after scene and the actresses are embarrassing to watch.
0.0,Not that many funny parts . Sad movie and a waste of money.

0.0,Not funny. Run as far away as you possibly can.
0.0,save yourself the trouble and sit in a hot bath with some candles for an hour.
0.0,"Hot Pursuit is supposedly an action comedy film, although it is far from both, as this film offers little to no laughs at all, and completely mediocre action scenes. Reese Witherspoon's voice alone is somewhat cringeworthy, although her opposite, Sofia Vergara, does her best to deliver."
1.0,This movie made me continually laugh!!
0.0,Armed and sort of dangerous.
0.0,A horrible way to spend 84 minutes. Simply devoid of laughs or smiles or producing anything that isn't a frown. I pray that Witherspoon's career never sinks as low as this again and that this is removed from screens as soon as possible to prevent further torture.
0.0,One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Both leads seem forced and trying to hard to be funny. Struggled to watch it to the end
0.0,Hot Pursuit is a painfully unfunny film. It is a bad ripoff of The Heat. None of the jokes land and the plot is very predictable. This is a poor movie that you shouldn't watch.
0.0,"Not that I say a Oscar nominees shouldn't take a comedy, but this is the kind of movie so called ""the script write funny""."
0.0,"This movie is pretty bad. Didn't even get to the end, and have no intention of trying to."

0.0,Contender for worst movie in history?
0.0,"It really is your typical Cop+Fugitive Road Trip story, with some attempts at comedy thrown in. We've seen this tired tale flop on the big screen countless times before, and Hot Pursuit is no different. The movie was headed for the gutter as soon as it began."

0.0,How bad was this movie? REALLY FREAKIN BAD.
0.0,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. The only scene I loved in the movie was when Christopher Walken was in the one scene. Christopher Walken was the only redeeming factor. Apart from his scene, the rest of the movie is crap."
0.0,Definitely as bad as advertised. I don't buy Affleck and Lopez has mob enforcer and the dialogue is AWFUL. Only watch this to remind yourself what truly bad movies are.

0.0,This the worst movie in the film story
0.0,si hubiera menos una estrella seria esa su calificaci¨®n
1.0,"Love this movie, one of the best of the 21st century."
0.0,"Not as bad as you've heard, but close, with obnoxious characters (Affleck is particularly annoying) and a very poor script. Kazan, Walken and Pacino provide the film with its only bright moments, relatively speaking, but even they can help this turkey."
0.0,"Wildly acclaimed as one of worst movies of all time, it unfortunately lives up to it's lack of hype."
0.0,I tried watching this. I really did. Beyond awful does not even begin to capture this thing.
0.0,Some of the worst dialogue ever written for a movie.
0.0,"Another film that doesn't allow a 0 star rating system. This film was the ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" of It's time, except Plan 9 was classic..."
0.0,I'm glad affleck rose above this. His acting in this movie was some of the worst I've ever seen.
0.0,A career ending movie!
0.0,When people say this is one of the worst movies of all time .... believe them.
0.0,One of the only Ben Affleck movies I hate. It was pretty bad. There were a few good one-liners but mostly it was crap.
0.0,"I saw this movie because it had such a bad reputation. It is the worst movie, not just in the history of cinema, but also the worst piece of drama, since the dawn of time. I gave it half a star because in came in a DVD case........."
0.0,The things you have heard about this film are true.
0.0,As bad as its reputation would lead you to believe.
0.0,I am a Ben Affleck fan so reviewing this beyond a star rating would be cruel.
0.0,My most hated film of all time.
0.0,Is there a way to give this a 1/4 a star?
0.0,Horrible Horrible Horrible movie. Her lecture about why the vagina is lovely is the dumbest scene in the movie.
1.0,"this movie rocks! to call it a movie would be an insult to its sheer brilliance and cinematic prowess, this is the definition of a true film, on par with some of the greatest films of the modern era"
0.0,"Ridiculous in its premise, vomit inducing in its sentimentality and everyone involved should be thoroughly ashamed of themselves. It's like the screen plays for Chasing Amy and Midnight Run we're spliced together by someone on Ketamine."
0.0,This movie was horrible.
0.0,One of the worst movies I've ever seen.
0.0,"...If you don't think this movie is a horrifying, brutal, torture-filled experience, you haven't seen it...but please don't for the love of God ever see it"
0.0,One Word :eeeeeaaaaooooouuuueeeeaaaaaaaguuuuuuuraaaaaghhhh!
0.0,movie fucking sucks.
0.0,"Incredibly stupid and surprisingly bad movie, I actually think Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez are great actors/actresses but they deserve a whole lot better than this piece of crap."
0.0,"Where Ben Afleck once was and JLo still is. This is the type movie that should be banned from being released. This movie gets a half star since I am sure Ben got him some a**, so you can't blame they guy."
0.0,"Yeah, I needed to try a viewing because I felt a little bad for it. Until I watched it."
0.0,Hahaha! The part where they have sex WITH CLOTHES is so funny!!The only good thing of this movie is the performance of Justin Bartha.
0.0,"It may be a cliche to say it, and it may be a cliche to apply it to this film. But it is, it truly is, the worst film ever made"
0.0,"I finally checked out this movie, and it did not disappoint, it was horrible. Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez were miscast and the dialogue was extremely painful: ""gobble, gobble."" The scenes with Walken and Pacino were like scenes from some other movie spliced into this one."
0.0,Probably the worst movie ever made. Pediod.
0.0,"""It's Turkey Time... Gobble Gobble""  Quite possibly the worst line of dialogue ever uttered on-screen."
0.0,one of the worst movies ever!!!! painful and insulting to sit through. no wonder lopez's and affleck's career are in the crapper. can you believe al pacino was in this? plus it was directed by the dude who made scent of a woman. something went wrong here.
1.0,It'll change your life.
0.0,"Truly awful. I watched it thinking that it can't be as bad as it was made out to be, but it was! Terrible story, awful acting, woeful dialogue, I could go on and on but I'll cut it short, simply because if I don't I'll go in to detail on why every scene if abysmal."
0.0,It's films like these that make me question why the stars were stars to begin with. A thin story fueled by a mediastorm we remember as Bennifer. It's a shame that good money was thrown down the rabbit hole on garbage like that.
1.0,"It may not be the best of Affleck and Lopez's movies, but just such a crack up"
0.0,Can't speak... so evil.... repressed memories of BLEUGH!
0.0,"I had to see it to see why there was all the negativity. Now I see. For the record, lesbians don't suddenly change their sexual orientation because of Ben Affleck."
1.0,HILARIOUS... even if unintended.
0.0,"Quite worthy of all the scorn heaped upon it. Incredibly lame. One thing that baffles me though: you can imagine z-grade actors like Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez being in something this crap, but what the hell were Al Pacino and Christopher Walken thinking?"
1.0,"Although I never saw it, I would have to put it on my movies of the decade for the sole reason that it united us in a strong dislike of Ben Afleck."
0.0,AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!
0.0,I hate the fact that Al Pacino was in this horrific movie.
0.0,"This horrendous quote from the movie says it all: ""You wanna be my bitch?"""

0.0,"So horrifyingly bad, it's entertaining"
0.0,The one good thing about this is that it more or less ended Ben Affleck's career.
0.0,I can't believe someone trusted either of these two with monologues!!!!
1.0,Watched it with no sound. Jenniger Lopez is hot.

0.0,honestly. the WORST movie ive ever seen.
0.0,"This is a horrid movie. Horrid. Boring predictable story, wooden acting... Two hours of my life I will never get back. *sigh* If you want to see Ben Affleck persuing a lesbian, watch Chasing Amy."

0.0,"Dear god, what the hell was that?"
0.0,"I'm not really sure where to start with this one...I suppose that this movie will prove to Hollywood that attaching attractive ""actors"" to a bullshit movie won't make it a hit."
0.0,Oh My God! I'd rather watch vomit congeal!

0.0,Christopher Walken is superb! Shame he's only in it for 3 minutes

0.0,Still better than the Happening

0.0,"I hated it. Ben Affleck's character was absolutely irredeemable. The acting was fine, I just hated the plot and the characters. I found Afleck's character completely offensive."
0.0,possibly the worst film i ever half assed watched
0.0,"This movie is one example that both Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez can't act. This movie didn't suck because they were dating, it suced because they are pretty bad actors."
0.0,"Shitness from go to whoa. A hitman falling in love with a lesbian assassin? Dear god, HELP US ALL! And to think they wanted to get married in real life. Truly tragic stuff."

0.0,Will almost certainly be studied in the future as one of the defining moments in the collapse of western civilization..... they really should have gotten married!
0.0,This movie requires negative stars!!!
0.0,This isn't THE worst movie ever...but when I saw this on T.V I realized it was really awkward. Part of the reason why a lot of people dislike Gigli is because of Benifer. They were an awful couple.

0.0,This movie turned me off of Benifer forever
0.0,"this was terrible, but it's just a bit better than ""the worst movie ever"" like most people say."
0.0,"If I could give zero stars, I would. This is an insult to film as an art. There is no coherent plot, the dialogue is dreadful and offensive, and the soundtrack sounds like the rejected B-sides from The Lion King 2. I actually felt physically ill watching only 1 hour of it."
0.0,"Terrible terrible movie. We all know how bad Jennifer Lopex and Ben Affleck are, but the really sad part is watching Al Pacino getting involved in this kind of outright crap."
0.0,Bennifer never sunk so low. Their onscreen chemistry was lukewarm at most. I can't believe that they were an item in real life you don't believe it on screen. We could also have used maybe some plot or storyline any would do.

0.0,"Awful awful film. Though I'm happy that I've seen it - it guarantees that I'll never ever see anything as bad ever again. As I say to my missus when we see a stinker ""Well. That was terrible. But not as bad as Lost in Translation"""

1.0,"Scarlett Johansson and Tokyo skylines, what more could you want?"

1.0,Great movie with good performances from Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson
1.0,Sofia Coppola se revela como una gran directora y Bill Murray y Scarlett Johnasson nos entregan unas actuaciones fuera de serie. Un tono perfecto y un ritmo absorbente convierte a esta pelicula en un cl¨¢sico instant¨¢neo acerca de lo que se gana y lo que se pierde en una relaci¨®n.

0.0,"Hard to watch, entire time I wondered when him and Scarlett were going to fuck. Did they?"

1.0,Sofia Copplia's Lost in Translation is the greatest film of all time in my opioun because it shows that why these films are made and how it can be important to people. Bill Murray gives his best performence ever in his carrer.

1.0,"pretty blatant racism & american nationalist agenda aside, this is a remarkably well-made film."

1.0,"If I told you Bill Murray could play a character so subtle and sentimental, that the comedy of the film strengthens the films overall artwork, it would be hard to believe. But it has been done. Scarlett Johansson was also phenomenal, and it was a shame she wasn't nominated for an Oscar."

1.0,Getting lost never felt so good!
1.0,She'll probably never top this or Virgin Suicides.
1.0,"Second viewing nearly a decade later, and I find it difficult to express how this film resonates with me. A story about unrequited attraction/love that is a film of contradictions; funny, melancholic, bittersweet, wistful, serious. Its power and pathos cannot be understated."

0.0,"Boring. Not Bill Murrays finest, not even mediocre."

1.0,"As long as Scarlett Johansson is involved, I'll get lost anywhere."

1.0,One of the most interesting movies I've ever seen.

1.0,"Sophia Coppola's best film is also the most artistic film by her. By using the surreal setting of Tokyo, we go through a journey through both the physical and mental states of our two protagonists. It is a film which proves that a coming of age story doesn't just apply to children."

1.0,"Plot a little predictable, but Gandolfini and Louis-Dreyfus made me not care!"
1.0,This was incredibly entertaining; a bittersweet reminder of a genuine acting talent. You can't help but think that this is the perfect movie to serve as the ending to Gandolfini's career. It shows you just how far he can stray from the persona for whom he will most be remembered. Awesome.

0.0,This movie was complete shit.
1.0,Wonderfully done comedy - drama has more to it than one might think. The nastiness of the job being done by Clooney and his pupal may turn off those who have been fired by such characters. On Blu-Ray.

1.0,You think you have life all figured out. And then you don't...
0.0,Anna Kendrick is excellent. Clooney is awful. There is no real conclusion or proper ending to the movie. i watched the end 4 times and still had no conclusion. Bad directing and writing. I do not like movies with the Ugly Clooney.

Credit to Clooney for delivering a spot on performance here, and of course to Jason Reitman for making great cinema."

1.0,Good movie! Oh and I love you Anna Kendrick! :*

1.0,"Geweldige film die je verweesd achterlaat. Je lacht bij aanvang, maar op het einde weet je eigenlijk niet meer waarom."
1.0,Cannot believe I went so long without seeing this film. Not the biggest Clooney fan but the acting in the film is amazing and a killer plot that leaves me pitying the lives of the characters by the end.
1.0,"A wonderful movie, led by charismatic performances by its three leads, with a smart blend of humor and emotion."
0.0,"Another boring movie that drags on forever. I'd pass on watching. This movie is ""fired"" so to say. Lol."
1.0,"Hard truths, funny trip to get there, all made enjoyable by great script smart direction and engaging performances."
1.0,"Vague message about career choice and relationship, but it makes you think. Basically, figure out who Iam and what i want to do/be then decide work/relationship I want to have"
1.0,A good movie starring Goerge Clooney. Basically it's about career choice and relationship. I like how the message is vague but makes you think about it.

1.0,"A really well-done film with a story that is both sweet and bitter simultaneously. A great ""sign-of-the-times"" movie. It also is one of the most realistic romances put on film in a while."
1.0,"I'm a sucker for anti-mainstream dramas, and this movie is just about great."

1.0,"Amazing performance from the three leads and a much more subtle performance than Bateman usually gives. Smart, funny, and has a surprising amount of heart."
1.0,It's much scarier than a horror movie that hold my nerves and makes me think of the reality. We are not definitely swans but sharks!
1.0,Anna Kendrick is amazing
0.0,"Mediocre movie. It was well acted I'll give it that but it had no real message to the story. Ultimately about a selfish guy, who doesn't really do any good in the world, and subcharacters that are unlikable. And depressing"

1.0,Best soundtrack ever.
1.0,"Every time I watch Up in the Air, I always see something new. Some little nuance of the characters, or some tiny line of dialogue that changes how I previously saw the film. And each time I watch it, it gets better. I don't see any reason that this film should get any less than 5/5 stars."

0.0,"from the beginning i was bored and angry, i quit 50 mins in."
0.0,You can barely call this 90 minute apple commercial a movie. It is terrible. Another example that Liam Hemsworth can't carry his own film. He is extremely unlikable in this. What are Ford and Oldman doing in this train wreck?
0.0,Garbage! The title doesn't even make sense once you sit through this mumbled mess...just a reason to see Liam in a nice suit and what a waste of Gary oldman talent
0.0,Very bad acting. Very bad story. Surprising considering the caliber of actors. Horrible movie.

0.0,"A techno-thriller movie that lacks techno-thrilling. It had a good premise, but the way it was shown was terrible. Ths script was so boring and cliched that it didn't creat any tension at all. All I can say is that it was a bore of a movie."

0.0,This movie was beyond horrible -- I blame the person who green light this script
0.0,Another wasted talent for Harrison ford and anyone else in it why bother with uninteresting plot
1.0,"Not really sure what this movie has been rated so poorly. Paranoia is an excellent film from start to finish. Two rival companies, their creators whom were friends at first, battle for the top seat in the industry stopping at nothing to reach the top. Espionage thriller"
0.0,"Maybe it should be called Underwhelma.... seriously Liam has no screen presence, a slice of Ham could have had the same film presence here. Sure you do get Ford and Oldman chewing the scenery up, but they're not given much to work with... terrible film"
1.0,Great movie. Worth the watch

0.0,"it was pretty much all over the place. nothing new. well, at least Hemsworth and Heard were pretty"
0.0,I went into the movie theater with a headache put left with a migraine. this movie gets sucked in to its own attempts to be clever and as result there is very litttle to understand or enjoy.
0.0,This movie is ridiculously stupid. Do not watch it. Its only redeeming factor (if you can count this as redeeming) is that the star-studded leads give categorically average performances.
0.0,WH??AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?
0.0,"No. Not even for such actors in the support as Gary Oldman, Richard Dreyfuss and Harrisson Ford. The half-star is just so I can post this on FB. I really wanted to slash my wrists after seeing this."

0.0,"La cinta tiene buenas actuaciones, incluso buena m¨²sica, sin embargo es bastante aburrida, su desarrollo no le ayuda bastante, es una pel¨ªcula plana, sin chiste alguno, sopor¨ªfera, en si Paranoia no vale mucho la pena."
0.0,"This deserves every Razzie nomination for wasting Josh Holloway's time, Gary Oldman's time, Harrison Ford's time, and mine."

1.0,Very nicely done. Good story and acting
0.0,"Gary and Harry, why?"
0.0,Boring. Stupid. The opposite of sexy.

1.0,I really enjoyed this movie Gary Oldman is always great no matter what.

0.0,why did I trust a movie with only two critics liked it at a moment
0.0,Bad dialogue coupled with poor acting and a plot that's totally cliche'
0.0,"Even Gary Oldman can't save this one. TERRIBLE adaptation of the novel. Even if Luketic claims it was 'fine' with the author, it's not 'fine' with most of the audience, including those of us who understand a movie can never stay completely true to a book. A travesty of directing, and screen writing."
0.0,"Don't even bother. Acting is unreliable, plot is artificial, technology references are stupid, and generally the whole movie is one big yawn. I have never watched such a redundant film as this one."

0.0,"The Book of Henry is one of the most misguided movies of the year, which ranges from being offensively exploitive to laughably incompetent, with terrible direction by Colin Trevorrow, and a plot that ranges from being Bridge to Terabithia to a hospital soap opera to Day of the Jackal."
0.0,THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN. It makes me not want to watch movies anymore. If I could I would give it 0 STARS. The acting was bad the plot had twist that made me think I was in the twilight zone. Also the production of the movie was terrible.

1.0,Slow burn but the last 30-40 mins are tense.
1.0,"Absolutely terrific! I remember when these events took place those many years ago. So I found it even more interesting to find out details of the release of those held captive and about Canada's involvement in their rescue! Edge of your seat exciting!

1.0,"Affleck proves (again) how much of a credible director he is...and for those who say isn't the best of actors, perhaps that's down to quality of previous scripts he has worked with. This proves that he is one of the finest actor/director's working in Hollywood today."

1.0,"Initially I wasn't interested in seeing this, however it's really worth the watch."

1.0,Was not expecting 'Argo' to be as good as it was. Unbelievably tense. Don't hesitate to watch.
1.0,"Ben Affleck just looked straight out sexy in this one, good suspense and action I give it a give for the handsome beard and long hair 70's style. Affleck one good-looking member of the beard gang."

1.0,"Absolutely fantastic, Ben affleck's best. My favourite movie of 2012"

1.0,"Very engrossing story. Even if you come into it having read the back story (as I had) it's still a very engaging story with great performances by the cast and crew alike. Hopefully, this is Ben Affleck's Oscar picture. He deserves it...for his directing, at least."
1.0,"The ending was inevitable, but the suspense was so great I was sitting on the edge of my seat for 30 straight minutes. Kind of hurt my butt honestly."
1.0,"I found nothing wrong with this nail-biting, tense, edge-of-your-seat popcorn fick; a very deserving oscar winner for Best Picture and for my favourite film list of all time!"
1.0,"Terse and tightly constructed in a way that is somewhat rare from Hollywood. It's not quite a masterpiece, but it's not the ethnocentric piece of patriotism that some critics have said it is. Affleck is a masterful director (his acting here ain't even that bad) and he shows it. Amazing movie."

1.0,"Odli?en muvi. Sem ostal kar presene?en. Zelo pristen 80s feel in na splono mi je zgodba zelo lepo izpeljana, nevsiljivo in nepretenciozno, okusno. Reija primerna zgodbi, igralska zasedba itak izjemna, tako da zelo priporo?am."
1.0,"Don't expect any high action battle scenes but this movie will still keep you tense to know how the outcome of all the hard work will turn out. I don't want to give out too much of the movie but as it states, this is all based on true events. You'll see what I mean."

1.0,"Ben Affleck directs and stars in this slickly made suspense/docudrama. The intensity is balanced out by humor (at the expense of late 70s Hollywood), creating a near perfect film. With this and his previous directing/starring effort (The Town), Affleck has really come into his own."

1.0,good suspense and a great film
1.0,"Great film, great true story an kept me on the edge of my seat!"
1.0,"Despite bending the truth here and there, Argo is quite an amazing film. In fact ti is one of Ben Afflecks best director wise. It tells the story it needs to, with a lot of suspense throughout. Not to mention the A+ acting that really brings this film together."
1.0,"Finally saw this. Had seen some negative reviews which kind kept me from watching it. Honestly may be my favorite 2016 movie now. Definitely not an action movie, but such a smart thoughtful experience from beginning to end."
1.0,"Holy crap!! You need to watch it for yourself. It may start slow, but adding the pieces of the plot together along with the characters leads to a fulfilling ending."
1.0,Seen in cinema- excellent!
0.0,Awful. Turned it off after. 15-20 min
1.0,"This movie is AMAZING. It is so high quality and original. It is a lot like Interstellar, but I felt my mind being left in an intellectual stupor even more so."
1.0,possibly my favorite movie ever

1.0,"Loved it, a really interesting film"
1.0,Watched it for the 10th time today - and still gets me.
0.0,"How did this movie get such great reviews?? This movie was horrible, boring, anticlimactic and had an ending that made absolutely no sense. Waste of time."
0.0,"So...""Arrival"" was basically the 2007 Sandra Bullock movie ""Premonition"" combined with ""Close Encounters of the 3rd Kind."" Cinematically, it was pretty. Story/Plot-wise, it was predictable and boring. I fell asleep watching it."
1.0,Good for what ails us right now
1.0,A sci-fi movie about an anthropologist saving the world!! Amazing!
1.0,Just amazing! Very complex and confusing but there's a beautiful message.
1.0,"great sci-fi, great drama, great film!"
1.0,"Amazing movie, exactly what I want from sci-fi"
0.0,"Worst movie since ET. Amy Adams is helpless and hopeless. People act in completely unrealistic ways that make no sense. ""Then a miracle occurs"" is the premise of the move."
1.0,"Made me think. The ideas were intriguing, and there was kind of a plot twist / surprise in the end. A little formulaic about the reactionary nature of humans (or maybe just realistic). I loved the idea that time is nonlinear. And I want to meet those aliens!"
1.0,Very well done. Amy Adams is perfect. Best Sci-fi movie since Contact.
1.0,Give it all the praise!!! Amazing movie
1.0,"Both Villenveuve and Adams are at their best here. Visually and emotionally stunning. I am, and always will be, dumbfounded that Adams did not receive more recognition for her role in bringing this story to life. The character work and use of misdirection is peak storytelling."
1.0,WOW this is truly a SFX masterpiece!!
1.0,"A smart, expertly paced and acted sci-fi thriller. Arrival, once again, proves director Denis Villenueve is one of the modern masters of our time.5/5 stars"
1.0,A great film to leave you pondering the human experience.
1.0,one of the best scifi
0.0,This movie was TERRIBLE! How did it get such a high rating? OMG. It was slow and boring for starters. And the end was just... Dumb.
1.0,Great acting and a great story! The plot twist at the end is one of the best I've seen in a long time! A must see for Sci Fi fans!
1.0,This is a special movie. It's not an action movie. It's not a thriller. Its not singular. It's nothing so pigeon-holed. It's f-ing smart. It's beautiful. It's masterfully crafted. Stop reading this. Go watch it.
1.0,Imagine the thrill of Close Encounters combined with the awe and wonder of 2001 A Space Odyssey. Director Dennis Villeneuve and Writer Eric Heisserer are now at the top of my list of favorite directors and writers.
1.0,Sublime. Perfectly executed and a fascinating look at perceptions if reality.
1.0,"I am generally not a fan of science fiction or thrillers, but Amy Adams successfully helms this excellent film that questions our pre-conceived notions of what science fiction really can be."
1.0,"A very thought invoking, and inspiring movie. I am blown away by the script, the direction and acting."
1.0,Amazing sci-fi movie!
1.0,Arrival movie is absolutely Glorious
0.0,"What a waste of my time, confusing and utterly stupid. WTF is what came to mind at the end. I only watched all of the movie waiting for something to tie together, never did. Had lots of questions that were never answered, just like tv show Lost."
1.0,I think this is a beautiful movie
1.0,A well-executed science fiction thriller that also carries a thought-provoking concept down to its structural core.
0.0,"Best movie by far to fall asleep to! Other than that...overrated, boring, and nothing special. Wish I never saw this movie. What a waste of time and money."
1.0,Enjoyable sci-fi quasi-thriller with some familiar themes from Contact.
1.0,"Incredibly powerful movie, a true ""statement of the human condition"".This story is a Shakespearean Tragedy masquerading as a sci-fi movie. That it didn't win multiple academy awards is shameful."
0.0,Normally I agree with the tomatometer and audience score. I found this the most boring movie I have seen in a long time. I actually watched it to the end in the hope that it would redeem itself but no luck on that front.
1.0,my favorite film <3
0.0,"Incredibly pretentious. This is a ""chick flick"" disguised as sifi. The style is ridiculously slow. The concept of the aliens was very good, but the interesting part of the movie, how to understand language was skipped over. Silly movie how it got 94% ratings from the pros is a head scratcher."
1.0,"Thoughtful, emotional and very moving. Something we all think about but can't quite fathom the logistics of meeting intelligent life outside of our own. Amy Adams shines."
1.0,"Loved this movie, the plot was so brilliant and i feel like it desserved more awards."
1.0,An absurdly good contact movie made with believe communication and an incredibly dense plot. One you'll want to pay very close attention to.
1.0,Inspiring! Stunning sound effects.
1.0,For once a symbolic story that goes against the typical vilified alien invasion type plot. A beautiful message linking advance communication and precognition skills. One of the most emotionally driven sci-fi movies of all time.
0.0,"Slow, stupid plot, ridiculous ending what a waste of timeWorst movie of 2016"
0.0,What a confusing mess. This movie was loaded with suspense...and then had zero pay off. This movie is easily one of the biggest wastes of time I've seen.

1.0,"This movie is moving, well thought out, beautifully presented, and a wonderful performance but Adams. The best movie of 2016 and 2017."
1.0,"Absolutely, fantastically, interesting throughout."
0.0,One of the worst movies I have ever saw.
1.0,"beautiful, slow in certain moments but definitely worth it for the ending!"

1.0,A fantastic movie that makes you think. Really beautifully done.
1.0,A masterclass science fiction that takes multiple viewings to truly appreciate and understand.
1.0,"Not only looks great, but remains grounded, sustaining a very human and emotional element to the science fiction genre, having a spirit all of its own."
1.0,"One of my 3 wishes, which for some reason extend to all humanity is to give everyone a common language so 'lost in translation' ceases to exist. This movie shares my desire, thought provoking and beautifully acted."
1.0,"This has been one of the best movie experiences I have ever had, the imagination and creativity the moviemakers used is excellent."
1.0,"I love a movie that keeps you thinking after its over, this movie delivers. Amy killed it and Im definetly rewatching this masterpiece."

1.0,Amazing. This movie is so innovative and interesting. The story and plot line are creative.
1.0,One of my favourite movies of all time. Amazing. Moving.
0.0,"I liked the timing and the main topic of the movie. But, the movie proceeds so slowly until the point that it was driving me crazy. I think the exact same plot with exact same acting quality could be done, half the time that this movie took (which is 111 minutes)."
0.0,"The more I reflect on it, the worse it gets."
1.0,"This movie is a masterpiece. Every line and every scene is significant and very well though/planned out. The subject matter was brilliant as well, communication...it shines a light on just how complicated it is. This is the best movie I have seen in recent memory."
1.0,Arrival is an intelligent film that gives a great performance from Amy Adams with language aspects
1.0,Fantastic. A Must see.
1.0,"Arrival is something different to the other sci-fi movies, it?s more focus on comunication and inteligence of the humans than the aliens. Amy Adams is amazing so as the story that it will blow your mind at the third act of the movie"
1.0,One of the best movies I have ever seen by far.
1.0,"Great movie!!! I am just left with questions, I'll have to watch again and get the answer!Would gladly watch a sequel if there is one!"
1.0,couldn't take my eyes off the screen. the atmosphere of this movie is truly captivating.
0.0,Not sure how this show got 93%! Was all excited to see it and boy was it a waste of time. First 45 minutes shear boredom. It was so dark I could hardly see each scene. Could have been so much better. Wish I could get me money back. Human Human Human ink blot ink blot octopus are now aliens!
1.0,"A really good movie. Im a smart person but I don't know if I'm smart enough for this movie. I really liked it, not one I'll buy but one I'll watch when ever its on to try and better understand it."
1.0,A tour-de-force. Equally riveting and revitalizing as it is meditative and poetic in its exploration of humanity.
0.0,This was easily the worst movie I have seen in a while. The boring drawn out plot that had such a poor careless ending. I literally would put this movie on any time you're having insomnia as it is guaranteed to remedy that issue. It only deserves 93% as sleeping medicine. Absolutely awful flim
1.0,"One of the most underated movies of 2016. An amazing original story, great cast and cinematography. But the music waa on another level. The actors did not have to speak, the music told the whole story."
0.0,"One of the most boring ""aliens come to earth"" movies I have ever seen. The plot is also implausible and forced. Other than some of the visual effects, the film is unwatchable."
1.0,"Simply marvelous. Excellent script, actors, everything was amazing"
1.0,It's not really a complex movie it's pretty easy to understand...it's just meh. Starts strong then gets a tad slow for a hour then gets going last 20 mins. Not really a great story but does make you think about what if you knew your future.
1.0,Smart sci-fi for adults.
0.0,Quit possibly one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time
1.0,Never thought I'd see a movie so thoughtful about Squid aliens and language. But I couldn't be happier about it.
1.0,A total tear jerker!
1.0,"Though you will see plenty of nods to past sci fi films and plenty of re-hashed themes, Arrival amply creates an amazing thought provoking sci fi with human morality. Amy Adams is on top of her game once again and once you fully grasp the film and its heady concept, you will be blown away."
1.0,wonderful music&timeline;

0.0,One of the worst movie I have ever watched!
1.0,I absolutely loved the film. It's a quality benchmark for all scifi to come.However... I wonder how would our audience and critics' ratings and reviews would be if there was a review page just for Arrival's Ending (2016).
1.0,"Can't think of anything I didn't like.Fascinating hard sci-fi, free from ridiculous OTT action scenes, sensible tonality, inventive cinematography.Very experimental, and very welcome."
0.0,"Just too confusing for me. I have no idea what happened at the end, but I didn't care. Was just glad it was over."
0.0,"This movie absolutely sucked ass. Horrible! I lost 2 hours of my life watching this piece of trash, waiting and waiting for it to go somewhere or get remotely interesting. Great actors and acting but the plot and story of the movie were just plain shit."

0.0,Pretentious AND boring... an almost unbearable combination. I hate almost everything about Arrival.

0.0,Wasted money to see this. Uggghh
0.0,First sifi film I have ever fallen asleep to!
1.0,This is one of the best constructed movies I have ever seen. Denis Villeneuve definitely knows his shit and he has a strong understanding on craft.

1.0,What can I say? I only regret not seeing this movie sooner. If you haven't seen it please do so.
0.0,Well there's 2 hours of my life I won't get back. This movie made no sense to me and even with such good actors it was extremely boring.
0.0,"Still unsure what I just watched. Their really was nothing to gain from watching this film. Spider aliens come to Earth, one person figures out how to communicate with the aliens within days, the aliens already know English, and they leave. Oh and they get married. Waste of time."

1.0,Muy interesante e inesperada

1.0,"At first viewing - on a plane - brilliant! Ambitious and largely intelligent, it's more successful than most in bringing big themes from the world of sci-fi literature to the big screen."
1.0,Definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's mind-blowing and yet I still understood it.
0.0,Nothing happens. Aliens come to save humanity in hopes that one day humanity will save them. One woman is the key and saves both. Aliens leave. The end. No action. Incredibly slow. Nothing to engage the audience. Would never recommend to anyone.
1.0,"Arrival is a highly inspiring movie, setting up the topic of extraterrestrial visitors from a whole different point of view. The intelligent storyline and a tense yet not overly thrilling narrative make this movie a great sci-fi experience."
1.0,Arrival is a unique story that it's not just a simple sci-fi movie but an incredible journey of our human existence as well as presenting unity between people. Strong performance from Amy Adams and brilliant direction from Denis Villeneuve.

1.0,So well written and acted
1.0,"A new sci-fi favorite (with some of the most interesting bits not even being science-based)! Thought provoking. I left with a mix of emotions (in the good way).

0.0,I'm only giving this move 1/2 a star because I can't seem to give it 0 stars. It was terrible.
0.0,"Totally confusing. Impossible to understand until I read the explanation on a website afterwards. Wish I'd read that before I watched. Actually, it would not have made the movie more interesting. Probably helps if you are SERIOUSLY into strange time shifting science fiction."

1.0,Intelligent sci-fi. Amy Adams is a national treasure.
1.0,"One of the greatest, if not THE greatest movie I have seen. From the cinematography, to the storyline and the performance of the actors and actresses. This is a must see movie that will move you on a deep philosophical level."
1.0,The GOOD movie from 2016 about Amy Adams and aliens the government doesn't quite trust. Arrival is smart and stays smart all the way to the end rather than just turning into a CGI action movie in the third act like a lesser movie would have. The twist is great and it makes you think.
1.0,"Wow... this movie was basically perfect for me. Great sci fi (my writing passion), linguistics (my education), smart story, & an almost gut wrenching finale when the truth comes together & my mouth is left gaping from the mind-blowing outcome. Phenomenal movie."

1.0,"So much deeper and heartfelt than I'm sure most people expected, and that's an amazing thing. What a movie. Beautiful performance from Adams. The story and writing, the direction, the visuals....everything is so great. Villeneuve is officially my new favorite director."
0.0,This was so boring. I can't believe how bad it was. What did people see in this to rate it so well?
1.0,"Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner are phenomenal. A space movie, when you put Independence Day and Gravity together. Arrival is great and oh my god it should have won best picture because no movie has put me on a cliff hanger than this. A must see film"

1.0,A brilliant film that blew me away.

0.0,They don't know how to finish this movie

1.0,Not your typical alien movie. Worth a watch.
1.0,"How could you not give this film five stars! I so enjoyed a film which captivated me throughout its entirety, it is an intellectual masterpiece. It kept me on the edge of my seat, trying to unravel the films beautiful riddles. A wonderful performance by both Adams and Renner."
0.0,Slow and drags on waiting for SOMETHING to happen
1.0,This is a Great movie
1.0,"Not a dull moment in this one. An incredible story that keeps you engaged the whole way through. Asks and answers some big questions. Like all time travel movies, we were able to come up with some flaws, but not until the car ride home. Absolutely go see it."
1.0,This was undoubtedly the peak of cinematic achievement in 2016.
0.0,A total waste of time.
0.0,"Sorry, guess many will hate me now...but this movie was one of the most boring ones in a long time ..."

0.0,This films dialogue is juvenile and so bad it's uncomfortable to watch actor's deliver their lines.
0.0,"Baywatch is too absurd to be charmingly stupid, and takes itself too seriously to be campy, overall, film could've been 40 minutes shorter and not be rated R."
0.0,This was a hard watch. Even though they had the most ridicolous source material which should've helped finding original jokes. But instead they just focus on sexual comedy which never lands. Only one time.. a little... Not even the charismatic stars of these movie could've saved this mess.

0.0,"Misguided, and while it's more of a lite action film than the comedy that it was marketed as, it doesn't work as either. Efron's character is extremely unlikable throughout the film. It is not worth one's time, even as a guilty pleasure."

0.0,it was horrible. it is not what you think... very disappointed that the ROCK took part in this movie.their comedy is a dominant focus on penises and tits. Their key comedy focal is ZAC holding and examining a dead mans penis and testicles (CAUTION... they focus on this quite a bit.)

0.0,"How bad is this film? Let's just say it should have been called ""Sewerwatch"" instead. The script seems like it was written by a coupld of teenage boys who just reached puberty. There is plenty of eye candy, but that only goes so far. The film sinks like a Rock."

0.0,This is one of these racist Jewish movie where they prefer to pay a white wash up actor over a new dark skinned comedian that would really make us laugh.

0.0,"I wish somebody had snatched me before I watched this and kept me locked up for a year, chained to a radiator in a rat-infested dungeon. That would have been more fun. As always Schumer is just not funny and the whole thing has been done countless times before. Pig spunk."

1.0,"It was entertaining. It is exactly what you'd want in a movie starring Amy Schumer and Goldie Haven - wacky, silly, even crude, but a lot of fun."
1.0,"This movie was a mindless comedy, which is actually what I wanted to see. It was very funny and I was entertained throughout. Ignore the bad reviews, if you're smart enough to know you aren't walking into a critically acclaimed Oscar nomination."
0.0,Amy Schumer was a bit funny but that is it. The movie was awful.
0.0,Acting-bad. Directing-bad. Writing-bad. Story-lame
1.0,This was probably the funniest comedy I've ever seen ! The whole theatre laughed out loud the entire time. I haven't had such a good belly laugh in forever. The synergy between Amy Schumer and Goldie Hawn was magic. Hope they plan to do another movie together soon. Well done!
0.0,"Total senseless and pointless crapfest. Not only did I not laugh, but my wife said that I had the most annoyed look that she's ever seen on my face for 91 minutes. That's 91 minutes and $22 that I can never get back."
0.0,"I wanted this to be good, but it really wasn't. Goldie Hawn is such a talented actress, but thus movie just wasted her talents. Amy just isn't funny enough for me."
1.0,"I thought it was very funny and entertaining. I really liked Godie Hawn in ""Private Benjamin"" and she's a good match with Amy Shumer. I'm surprised it doesn't have a higher score. The guy who plays her brother is hilarious."

0.0,I love Goldie but Schumer is sooooo obnoxious she should find another occupation.
0.0,I wanted this movie to be good- it just wasn't. Terrible waste of Goldie Hawn's talent which nonetheless shined through. Amy's schtick is getting old on film and I'm a fan. She should stick to her excellent TV format. Not even 1 laugh. Don't go.

1.0,I literally laughed out loud the WHOLE TIME!!
0.0,Goldie is cute as always but Schumer and Sykes? This one is a train wreck. Don't waste your money.
1.0,Feel like most of these reviews are more about Amy Schumer as a person. This movie was really funny. It's a silly comedy. Not as deep as Trainwreck. It delivers the laughs. It should be as taken as seriously as the silly comedy it is....and as that it delivers hard.
0.0,Terrible. Worse than expected. How much longer can they cast Schumer as the same person? It's tired and so was this movie.
0.0,"Oh dear gawd ... somebody PLEASE, stop putting Schumer in front of us."
0.0,I would give this movie zero stars if possible. This was the most UNFUNNY comedy movie in the past ten to twenty years. Schumer and Goldie should be personally responsible for ticket refunds. Typical Hollywood crap movie with no redeeming qualities !

1.0,it was raunchy and hilarious! I loved it. All you movie critics are over thinking this ...
0.0,It was another bad Amy Schumer movie once again jokes were unfunny but I was humored by one or two. And Goldie Hawn just more and likely wanted do a movie to pass on when she was younger. It was crazy sick rude but that's her movies for you.

1.0,Came out of the theater laughing! I'm surprised most of these critics are so humorless.
0.0,"This movie was so horrible, it prompted me to sign up for a Rotton Tomato account just so I could warn people not to see it. Didn't laugh once at the crude attempt of humor and felt sorry for all of the mother/daughters in the audience who wasted a beautiful Mother's Day watching this trash."

1.0,we laughed out loud the entire movie!
0.0,As a brain surgeon I am seriously concerned about those that found anything that remotely resembled comedy in this movie. You need to schedule an appointment for a functional MRI brain scan immediately. You have a section of brain matter that is malfunctioning!
1.0,We loved this movie! Perfect mother daughter flick. Hilarious!! Would see it again!
0.0,Literally the first comedy I have EVER walked out of. Amy Schumer was funny 3 years ago but every year she has become more and more irrelevant and ridiculous to me. She is SO out of touch with most Americans that she can't make a movie that connects with anyone. Avoid this bomb

1.0,"I love Amy's humor (contrary to most people) and I honestly thought this movie was great. A little bit vulgar at times and over the top, but it is very funny - it even had my friend laughing that I had to force to come with me because he's one of those ""I hate Amy Schumer"" people."

1.0,"Terrific, laughed all the way through."
1.0,"Possibly the funniest movie I've ever seen. The laughs kept coming from dialogue, stunts, characters, ridiculous situations, and lean use of melodramatic cliches played for laughs.

1.0,This is a really funny movie! Everyone in the theatre was laughing.
1.0,"There aren't many movies that make me literally laugh out loud, but this one did, many times! Amy is wrong and raunchy and real and hysterical. Wanda Sykes and Joan Cusack were hysterical. I can't believe people didn't like it. I need to see it again to relive some of the lines. Highly recommend it."
0.0,Had high hopes for this film but apparently the same old dull rhetoric from Schumer with a lack of imagination doomed this to oblivion. Watch the trailer that's the only funny parts in the movie I would like a refund but I think she needs the money to buy matresses to repair her image.
0.0,"Another terrible, not very funny, performance by Schumer. Move was salvaged by Goldie. Schumer need to look for a new profession."

1.0,Loved the film! I hope The Disaster Artist receives an Academy Awards nomination.

1.0,"Absolutely hilarious film that hit all the right emotions. I loved the graininess of the film bringing you to that late 90s look which captures the essence of setting of this comedy. Franco brothers did it again, fantastic job."
1.0,This was a great film and an amazing performance from Franco!
1.0,I was in tears. Hadn't laugh from a movie like that in forever!!
1.0,Completely met and surpassed all expectations.

1.0,"James Franco tells amazingly the stoy of Tommy Wiseau's ill fated film production, and how it's mysterious lack of turned it into a cult hit. The only problem is that they did not include some of the legendary bizarre details. ne of the years best perfomances and films."
1.0,Audience and I cheered
1.0,An amazing showcase for James Franco. Well done but squirm inducing.
0.0,This movie is garbage

1.0,Hilarious and heartfelt ! BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR !!! OSCAR WORTHY
1.0,"James Franco puts on a helluva performance as Tommy Wiseau as does Dave Franco playing Greg Sestero,it is quite hilarious at times but you cant help but feel bad for Wiseau towards the end.I can definitely see this winning a couple oscars next year."
1.0,Exceeded any possible expectations.
1.0,Best comedy I have seen since I don't know when.
1.0,Brilliant! My favourite performance from James franco. I was laughing a lot. I defiantly think you will appreciate it a little bit more if you watch the room first. But this is awesome.
1.0,"Funny and sad, this is an incredibly moving and hilarious account of the making of The Room (which my friend and I had never seen). James Franco is brilliant, in the best role that I have ever seen him in."

1.0,"I predict some Oscars here! I always loved laughing at ""The room"" that this film is based upon."
1.0,"amazing film, brilliantly put together, deserves so many awards!!!!!!! Oh Hai Doggie"

1.0,Such a funny movie went to watch it tonight it's a must see I was very nervous about going to watch it at first bhht now I really want to go again
1.0,Step down Ed Wood this takes the cake for best movie based on a movie. James franco blows this performance away the commitment he had to nailing tommy's style is just captivating. an incredible journey from start to finish. 100% worth watching.

1.0,I'm fed up wit dis whirld

1.0,Hilarious yet sad with a moral of friendship
1.0,A fantastic look at filmmaking through the eyes of an outsider.
1.0,"James Franco gives perhaps a career best performance as the enigmatic Tommy Wiseau. If you are a fan of Wiseau's ""The Room"" like me, than this movie was made for you. If you're not a fan of ""The Room"", well then there's still a lot to love."
0.0,The first 15-20 minutes were tolerable. And the rest of the movie was horrible. I went to a screening for free and I feel like I should be reimbursed for the $3 I spent for my parking.
1.0,"Saw an audience screening months ago. Hilarious, sad, sweet. James and Dave both give stellar performances. The rest of the cast is also excellent. This movie will have great audience and word-of-mouth success."
1.0,It could be the best comedy film in the history.
1.0,Just go see this movie. Do it.
1.0,What's the line again?
1.0,YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES YES SI SI SI SI SI SI SI OUI OUI OUI
1.0,"If you set your expectations lower, based on the low-ratings reviews and then watch the movie, you are going to be very satisfied that it was not bad at all. One of the best movies in 2017 for me ... I loved it ... ;)"
1.0,"I don't know how the critics can see the film as being so bad, to me it was one of the best films I've seen this year so far. Highly recommend to watch, I have completely changed my opinion on critics now. I'm definitely not going to trust their opinion as I used to."
0.0,I created an account for the opportunity to rate this movie as lowly as possible. Terrible adaptation of a classic book series. I feel the need to re-read the books (again) to wash the taste of this movie out of my mouth.
0.0,"I've read the whole saga through three times, and this version was painful, horrible and miserable. Netflix/Amazon/HBO, please buy the rights and do it justice."
0.0,"oh my god, what a waste of time. ...I will say, Matthew McConaughey did a wonderful job"
1.0,"For TRUE fans of the Gunslinger. It's all gone 20. It's what happens after the books. Roland has that blasted horn, may he reach the end and blow the damned thing. If you want the books than wait for the mini series. Long Days and pleasant nights if it do ya."
0.0,Would be better to not make it then completely destroying any chance of having one of the best series I've read being made in a decent series of movies.HBO please take it are redo it!
1.0,"As a movie it's completely interesting from the beginning, it maintained me awake because the plot is very well settled and the movie portrays an amazing story that could be one of the best movies of the 2017. Why are there a lot of negative reviews if it's an amazing movie with good actor plays?"
0.0,"well, it is a littler better than John Carter"
1.0,I know everyone is hating on this movie but I for one loved it ??
0.0,So bad it's a wonder it got made at all.
0.0,the main character roland de chainee is white blue eyed fair haired and they castca black guy ruined before it started. u cant change the main character that much and be true to the story. also drawing of the 3 they cut out one of the main people. its worse than bad its incredibly bad
0.0,"Awful; dry, super rushed, no real character development, and even by sci-fi standards very unbelievable mash of magic and technology. The only good thing about it was how short it was."
0.0,I blame Stephen King for this. He has enough power that he could of had end of script approval but instead he just cashed the cheques. So a movie based on a sweeping 7 book series was turned into a YA flick; at least we didn't have sparkling vampires.
0.0,"I love the gunslinger books I have read and re-read them. Amazing books. I just saw the Dark Tower and it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Worse than the Hobbit. Awful, terrible horrible"
0.0,It stripped everything that was great about the story and left it as nothing but a mindless action flick that made no sence.
1.0,"Another movie I'm not sure why people didn't like. Great actors with an interesting story line. Maybe people didn't understand the plot. I don't know, its a great movie."
1.0,"I don't get the hate for this movie. I loved the book series, have read them over and over again-- how do you condense eight books into a film? Idris Elba was phenomenal as Roland Deschain! Some of the Jake storyline was very dry, but otherwise it was a good movie. Five stars."
0.0,When the only redeeming quality for a movie is that it's short that's bad.
0.0,Just terrible makes absolutely no sense.
0.0,Pass on this one. Watch Netflix instead.
0.0,"Such engaging books, such a slog on screen. Would have preferred waiting for a proper adaptation."
0.0,"A, ja pljuvao Kinga to je krljavo vodio i zavrio sagu...Kakvo ?ubre!"
0.0,A total disaster. Wretched script from someone who hadn?t read the first or any of the series! Awful
0.0,"What the hell were they thinking casting Matthew McConaughey?!!! I'm all for stepping out of his ""alright alright alright"" career days but this didn't feel natural for him. Just felt like he was killing his victims with his breath, he got so close!"
1.0,Really great tie into the books. Wish it had a longer run time and tied in Eddie Dean but overall great film.
0.0,Su much potential and such a missed opportunity. A property that should probably be a miniseries not a 90 minute film. Just a hot jumbled mess. Incoherent story. Not a redeming quality about this movie. 1/10
0.0,Idris Elba as Roland? Seriously? Elba looks nothing like Clint Eastwood.Elba as Roland totally ruined the movie for me. What next --Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher?
0.0,I wanted so badly to like this movie... :(
0.0,Still wondering why I even bothered to take the time to watch this.
1.0,"I know complainers say this is not like the book, and it wasn't. It did have a good story line and was very entertaining. Idris and the actors did a great job. I'm sorry I listened to the reviews and didn't see it in theaters!"
1.0,A fun compression of the books into a single movie. This is a very post apocalyptic / body snatchers kind of story mixed with some Good the Bad and the Ugly. Elba and Mathew were terrific. This isn't an all out action ride. It takes a moment to get rolling but that is necessary.
0.0,Not sure if the book is any better but this one sucks. Still Elba is one badass character.
1.0,Loved it! Fluid synchronicity and quick movement scene to scene with plot in tact and momentum just right! Great movie!
0.0,Worst pile of crap I've seen in a long time. I wish there was a 0 star rating.
1.0,"Great movie. Of course the people who review movies professionally don't like this movie, but it is definitely worth watching"
0.0,"I'd give this film a zero or negative score if it was possible. Worst book to film adaptation I've ever seen. No build up, no story development, no character development, plot holes, and no pay off when the credits roll."
1.0,"Great movie, it had a rushed story line... I feel they could have added more to the movie."
0.0,Stephen Kings worst novel and is now his worst movie.
0.0,"Even if I had not read the books I would say this movie was bad. But having read the books makes it even worse! I do think Idris Elba makes a great Roland. But the storyline was disjointed, clunky & just down right bad! I am disgusted that anyone would butcher such a great story this way."
1.0,"Loved it. I think it is missing some depth, but a good start to the series. Overall, a great movie. I think some history on the gun slinger could have helped and how this kid get involved. Would recommend this movie over and over."
0.0,Even Matthew McConaughey and Idris Elba's performance can't save the movie. Plot is too rushed and there is zero character development. All of the action scenes in the movie is shown in the trailer.
1.0,I grew up shooting guns so I loved this movie and how they showed that when there is a killing with a gun it can be in self defense not always a murderand over all I just loved this movie it was funny action packed and memorable
0.0,"This movie exemplifies the very definition of the word ""inconsistent"". Plus it's terrible."
1.0,Great movie. I was entertained all the way through. I will love to see a sequel and how this Crimson King ties on to other stories. Namely IT.
0.0,Should have stuck to the book. Very disappointed.
1.0,Critics never get it right on the good ones.
0.0,"Good cast of characters, not much else, I was looking forward to seeing this movie because of the book. This did the book an injustice,"
0.0,"Total junk, not a patch on the books. Avoid."
1.0,"Cross between a western and a sci-fi, the story was brilliant. Matthew McConaughey as the bad guy played it extremely well a great baddie and Idris Elba A?s the gunslinger was amazing. All in all a brilliant film!"
0.0,"The Dark Tower does not do its source material justice, what is suppose to be an epic adventure turns out to be a boring slog."
1.0,Good overall movie don't quite understand the harsh critics
1.0,"This was absolutely really good! I really enjoyed it a lot because I loved the entire movie! If you are fans of Stephen King's ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""The Green Mile"", then you will love this movie! It's definitely a must see!"
0.0,Idris Elba wasn't enough to carry this horribly rendered adaptation.
1.0,Was a great movie. Don't let the rotten Rotten Tomatoes keep you from watching it.
1.0,"Exceptional movie with action, special effects and more. Definitely a must see!"

0.0,"Crap plot, crap performance, crap script. Dull weak poor predictable and boring"
0.0,This is an embarrassment. A complete disservice to an outstanding book series. Do yourself a favor and read them instead of watching this garbage.
0.0,"Full Disclosure: Did not read the books.That being said, I feel I have a pretty high IQ, if not for movies, and I had to leave when some kid and a house were merging or flying or..???? First time in a long time I left a theater - but I had better a thing to do. I swear, I did."

0.0,what a load of shite
0.0,Filled with plot holes. I was waiting with my wife to the last scene when it would be revealed that everything happened inside Jake's troubled mind. But that scene never happened. I hate such movies that treat the audience as dumb people. Highly overrated piece of cr*p.

1.0,A really interesting and exciting action packed adventure!
1.0,Great movie a lot of action.

0.0,awful absolutely terrible it's a shame they ruined a classic novel like this
0.0,Watching Dark Tower was similar to watching a tower in the dark..well you cannot see a tower in the dark.
0.0,This movie killed Stephen King's magnum opus. Good job.
0.0,"What a total let down! So vanilla. The Dark Tower deserves to be epic, this was not epic. It was more like an old made for TV movie. So disappointed!"
0.0,"I AM REALLY UPSET AT SONY! They really screwed this up. New Line should have gotten this film. One chance and you wrecked it so bad. What was Sony Thinking, I dont support Sony movies anymore."
1.0,"Excellent. Pacy, superbly cast, great effects, wonderful acting, fabulous world-building. Recreated the world of the Dark Tower as a stand-alone movie, which means people who haven't read the books can still enjoy the story. I'd go and see it twice."
1.0,Great take on the books.
1.0,I'm glad I disregarded the negative reviews. This movie was great!
0.0,I am a fan on the books and this thing was enough of a disappointment that I walked out on it. Thankfully it was only a 5 dollar matinee.
1.0,"The plot is very nice! And the cast, too!"
1.0,This movie has played well as a sequel to the books but unfortunately that wont play well with most audiences. Its better than people are letting on.
0.0,"What where they thinking, this looks like something that had great source material and some deeper message, but the movie is just completely pointles."
0.0,Absolutely pile of crap ie shit - let me just say Idris Elba is a good actor just hasn't been offered the right roles since Luther
0.0,"What a disaster! Being a fan of The Dark Tower series, expectations were high. The let down was of epic proportions to say the least. The script misses major plot points and arrives at the conclusion like a train wreck. Avoid this abortion at all cost!"
1.0,People are so critical!! It was good!
1.0,Loved this movie!!! I don't understand why ratings are so low? Saw it 3 times and can't wait for it on cable!
0.0,I wish could say that this was a good movie but no it was very disappointing and crappy.
0.0,This movie had so much potential but squandered it on poor delivery. Best to skip it altogether.
1.0,I thought the Dark Tower was a good one. The action and adventure is good. There is the myth.
0.0,To say this was disappointing would be an understatement!
1.0,"I'm not sure why so many people didn't like this movie. It was full of amazing acting, a storyline that's totally different and brand new that keeps you from being able to predict anything. I loved it and talk about a damn good bad guy! Give it a chance"
0.0,What were you thinking Stephen? This is not the gunslinger from the books.
0.0,"Just awful. As soon as it opened without the famous opening line from the book, I sensed trouble. It just got worse from there. Quite possibly the worst movie I've ever spent money on."
0.0,"lame, boring and only the actors make it barely viewable"
0.0,"A jumbled piece of crap. These books deserved better. The fans who've been waiting decades deserved better. Every Stephen King novel has now it's mystique due to the hunk of dog turd that was this incoherent, inaccurate, fever dream of a low budget 3rd Grade production."
1.0,"Pretty good, I just wish it was bit longer."
1.0,"I loved this movie. Not sure what the hell everyone doesn't like about it. Moved at a smooth pace. Was actual acting in it, not just unbelievable gun fights. I go to the movies to be entertained. Hope to see another one!"
1.0,My reflection on this great movie is mainly about how beautifully the script was written allowing me to connect some dots between the real life of ordinary people and the imaginary life of psychologically challenged people!
1.0,"Very good movie, just can't imagine it covered 8 books!"
0.0,"I am a big fan of the book series and I was shocked. This film is so dumb, dull, mediocre. Stephen King forgot the face of his father, he betrayed his true fans big time by letting this terrible film happen!"
1.0,"I thought this was great. Excellent references to some other King novels, I thought could have been more too. I think of it could sun this up I would say, satisfying, but could have been longer and had more in it. (Not just in reference to IT of course)"
0.0,"A completely stand alone movie which has basically nothing to do with the books and was rushed, shallow, and forgettable. Might not even be worth it for free."
0.0,What really was the process of this movie? No action and you know what was going to happen. Good actors bad story line. Ugh
1.0,"This is a good action movie. Fast paced, maybe a bit formulaic.People comparing it to the books must have never seen a book adapation before.If you want to see have some fun, go see it. If you think someone made an 85 minute adaptation of four books you will have less fun."
0.0,"If you read the books, don't pay to see this. They (the movie industry) hacked this great story into little pieces, threw out 90% of them, and then in a childlike manner superglued the rest together."
1.0,This movie was very different from the books but still blew me away. Idris Elba is a badass through the whole movie and in all just a great movie.
0.0,"Es una porquer¨ªa de pel¨ªcula.Ni siquiera ""palomera"".Por un momento me sent¨ª en una mala escena de X Men"
0.0,"Somehow this movie managed to take all the best parts of all of the Dark Tower books and not put them in the movie. If you love the books and want of really bad taste in your mouth after you see a movie, go see this awful adaptation of Stephen King's Dark Tower series."

0.0,"I attended with another fan and reader of the books. We both found the film an extremely disappointing adaptation. It stands only as a weak homage to an expansive world/universe created by SK, but devoid of his complex character development and relationships. A lobstrosity of a film."
0.0,"Tried way to hard to make a stephen king cinematic universe!They had ""The Shining"" in it!"

1.0,Awesomely creative movie! very good acting and story plot!
0.0,"The worst adaptation I've ever seen in my life. Soulless. Senseless. Nothing made sense. Even the characters weren't quite right. And just little things, too, making it not at all familiar, and appeal to nobody. I feel rage towards this film. The only thing that wasn't terrible was the cast."
1.0,This is better than I imagined & thoroughly enjoyed it!
1.0,Fantastic film with three excellent performances. McConaughey was very scary as the villain.

1.0,I don't known what the critics are smoking. This movie was kick ads. Loved it
0.0,"Apart from the character names, nothing is true to the source material. The characters are pretty boring and Roland is a bit bipolar feeling. You never really connect to anybody or have a sense of urgency."
1.0,"Say what you will, I liked it. It's a good introduction to the world of the Gunslinger and I hope more follows. They can dig deeper into the mythology as they go along."
1.0,"Really enjoyed the action and acting (it was fun!). Not familiar with the books, but this movie kept me engaged and on the edge of my seat. The shootout scenes were terrific and I was entertained. Really needed the escape from reality and this movie delivered."
0.0,This movie has forgotten the face of its father.
1.0,"This movie was a great stand alone flick with good acting, great costuming/cgi, and plenty of Easter eggs. If you're looking for Harry Potter our lotr go watch those flicks. This movie was 90 minutes of pure, original fun"
1.0,Idris Elba is a GOD. Amen.
1.0,enjoy movie looking forward to the next one
1.0,never read the books but thought I'd give it a try. AMAZING. Can't wait to order the audio books!!!
0.0,Imagine there was a movie simply titled Harry Potter which crammed all my J.K. Rowling's years of work into a 95 minute movie. That is exactly what you get with The Dark Tower. Totally devoid of depth or significance.
0.0,"Terribly put together movie!!! ""NO STARS"""
1.0,I had a lot of fun watching this movie. There was a ton of Stephen King universe easter eggs throughout the movie. I'm not crazy about all of the changes from the book story but mostly I like what they did with it. I sure hope they can continue the series.
0.0,All I want to do is find and kill Walter....
1.0,It is a good sumer movie with a steady moving plot and a fair amount of action. The actors gave giid performances stayed true to their characters.

1.0,???????????? it pains me to give 5 stars but it needs to make money to show enough interest for a better attempt!
1.0,"I loved this movie. You have to look at it as if it is after the final book. You want everything to change. if it doesn't, Roland fails."
1.0,"Really not that bad. Didn't live anywhere close to expectation, but still ok. Technically sound, with good editing and good performances. Bad sadly the writing is utterly atrocious and the direction, such as cinematography isn't anything special. I'd give it a 6/10."

1.0,"It is obviously another ""turn off the wheel"", not the exact story laid out in the series of books. At one point the Man in Black says, ""Let's make this turn off the wheel our last...""It is well done within the timeframe.If you are a King fan, go see it, knowing this is another turn off the wheel."
0.0,I want my money back.

0.0,Tries to copy the punchlines of the Brendan Frasier version but fails at so many levels.

1.0,"I loved the movie, Great, why are people downing it %\+¡Á//$/¡Á"
0.0,Well the special effect were good...not a good movie. It tried to be funny (unsuccessfully) and tries to be a serious suspense movie (unsuccessfully). I think it suffered from bad dialogue and lots of overacting. I sort of hated it.
0.0,One of the laziest film scripts that you have ever seen come to life with less than remarkable CGI to cement how truly uninspired all of this really is. D-
0.0,"this movie was simply boring, if you want something fun to watch the original is the way to go. if this is what can be expected from the so called ""Dark Universe"" movies they should stop now and save some money."
0.0,Could've been sexier. Cruise was awful. Overacted.

1.0,The best cliffhangers
0.0,"For once, I wish the mummy would have won! I dread a sequel!"
0.0,"As opposed to many filmgoers, I like Cruise's films. Usually. But as we become more savvy, we can smell a bad film early on. The trailers made it clear that the villain brought nothing new, and in fact, didn't engender an ounce of fear or thrill. Skip this mess, and move on to something better."
0.0,Not too bad premise and legend stuff but so many fragmented scenes in the storytelling. A lot of clues to possibly future films? Like hyde and a vampire skull? A Forgettable movie.
0.0,"Not worth my $5.99 Comcast rental. Promising cast and storyline but ends up cut together, predictable and boring."
0.0,all over the place!!
0.0,Tom cruise makes another lousy movie!! He needs to go clear and leave the movie business.

0.0,This would have been much better without Tom Cruise; he ruins everything.
0.0,"So far, I'm half way through this silly movie. I can't believe that Tom Cruise and Russell Crowe would be involved in such a disaster! It gave it one star because I like these two actors, at least I liked their previous work."
0.0,I could go into some eloquent spiel but why? This is the worst movie I've seen in a very long time. Did the writers have a 45 minute deadline? Horrid!
1.0,Awesome movie! Forget the naysayers!
0.0,"Expected a thriller/horror movie not a cheesy adventure. So much for the ""dark universe"" also awful casting."

1.0,"I love it.Funny and slightly dark. And of course, Cruise is a bonus ;)"
1.0,"It is a different take, so what! It uses references from other movies, so what! What do you think 3/4 of Hollywood does? It had good acting and hopefully the sequel if there is one will be better."
0.0,"A deadly serious opening is followed up with Tom Cruise et al engaged in playful campy banter and just does not work at all. The movie bounces back about forth between dark, campy, scary, over and over again. It's just bad. Oh and weird."

0.0,this movie is totally garb*ge
0.0,The worst movie I have ever seen. Tom Cruise's talent is 100% wasted in this clunker. It was so bad that my wife and some others demanded their money back. This is an hour and one half of your life you will never get back.

0.0,The mummy series will always be a classic and this remake is one of the worst decisions hollywood has made. Crowe and Cruise is such a waste to have played in this worthless movie. The film also tries to copy the comedy from the original and ends up looking stupid.
0.0,Simple review The dark universe have started on the wrong foot actually maybe it shouldn't of taking a single step. Tom cruise is usually awesome but this movie did not let him go full TOM!
1.0,Incredible!!! Loved this move can't wait for the rest of the dark universe

0.0,The Mummy 1999 & The Mummy 2001 was one of the BEST Movies ever made and The Mummy 2017 was a serious shit with high budget.
1.0,Don't listen to the critics. I loved it
1.0,They should have marketed the Dark World Universe to create the Origins Vibe not knowing all of the superstars of the 30 and 40s Monster movies would have created a buzz. Especially the Cruises Character really is Van Helsing would have definitely helped.

0.0,Worse than Interview with a Vampire - Tom Cruise cashes out ???????

0.0,Honestly one of the most stupid and boring movies off all time
0.0,By far the worst performance of Tom Cruise! What was Russel Crowe even thinking??
1.0,Both heroin and villain female actors were hotter than wonder woman. This film had better special effects as well. I loved it. All his movies spend money on making a good quality pix. Wonder woman looked like a low budget film compared to this

0.0,"The only good seconds of the movie were when the girl took the book of The Deads because there's a clear link with 90's movie version, that is so beautiful! Anyway this movie is not just The Mummy, but is a beginning of a bigger ""saga""..I'm not interested in this new dark universe."

0.0,It was awful. I feel robbed of my time.
0.0,"The first third had a good story. The last third had some good action. The middle was slow. No good acting, no good effects,and horrendous dialogue to go with it. When I use the word good, I mean that it was the only reason I was still watching."
0.0,"Walked out after the first 40 minutes. An awful movie that was all over the place: comedy, horror, and very weak action to boot. The script should have never been let out of the sarcophagus."
0.0,This is one of the two movies I ever fell asleep when watching. The other one is Ice Age 5!
0.0,Extremely bad. Nowhere near the original Mummy movies
0.0,The Mummy lacks the fun thrills like the old Mummy movies. But its plot is more of the same. This time the Ahmanet character interacts with demons to try to be in power and create Armageddon to the world.
0.0,Why is Tom Cruise still being cast in movies?
1.0,Better than I anticipated.
1.0,actually a pretty decent action/horror film. not sure why the critics hate it
0.0,Too many storylines going on at once. Plus there were awkward moments where they tried to turn the movie into a comedy which didn't work in an action movie like this. Also there was zero character development and nonsensical zombies which made me feel like I was watching a satirical film.

0.0,sucked just horrible movie story sucked to slow just annoying

0.0,How do I give zero stars..? I hate zombie movies
1.0,There are times where I trust the views of rotten tomatoes and then there are times when I dont...these are one of those times where I don't agree. I don't know what they were expecting but if you loved the mummy franchise then you'll love this.

1.0,This was a GREAT Movie & fun to the end! What a BS review!

1.0,"It was a great movie! It was never meant to the replace Brendan Frasier's the mummy at all, which is what I think most people were expecting. It's a whole new story/universe and its going to be awesome!"

0.0,"This is a painful attempt to create a world/franchise similar to Avengers and Justice League, but with monster characters. Sofia Boutella's performance is the best part of the movie. The other 97% is garbage. Save yourself the ticket price and watch the 1999 film again."
0.0,Swimming zombies......nuff said.

1.0,Amazing movie that EVERYBODY should see.
0.0,It left a bitter taste in my mouth. I thought it to be one of those movies that give the horror genre a bad name. I anticipated the resolution from the first 10-20 min of the movie before even the premise was clearly set and I was right.

1.0,Solid thriller. See it.

1.0,Detailed review to follow.
1.0,"Beautiful and tragic. Perhaps Guillermo Del Toro's finest work. A dark, chilling fairy tale; as if a Grimm's fairy tale blended with a Lewis Carrol story in a Guillermo Del Toro nightmare. Tim Burton wishes he could make a movie this good. Ok any director wishes they could make a movie this good."

1.0,"Strong, Violent, and Perverted in epic proportions.Horror fans will fall in love with this film."
0.0,"Very low budget, amateurish slasher flick. More so than the usual slasher flick. It was a relatively stupid plot -- what there was of one -- and single camera shortcuts with facial closeups of the psychos providing the major 'screams' in the movie. How this manages to garner a 97% I'll never know."
1.0,"It's Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Carrie and Saw all rolled up into one very smart and very eerie must see torture horror...this film is right off the bloody charts for me and equals, if not, tops ""Let the Right One In"" for best horror so far of the 21st century - can you tell I'm excited?"

0.0,"Another utterly pointless teen 'horror' flick. Dull, dull, dull. Avoid."
1.0,"A cracking bloody tale if ever there was one. Since this is only the second movie from director Sean Byrne, he deserves a severe amount of credit due to the atmosphere he creates and sustains throughout. More than enough twists and turns to keep you hooked until the end."

1.0,Best Aussie film I've seen in ages - in its genre this is a cult classic waiting to happen - The Cars That Ate Paris is nothing on this film!

1.0,it's a horror of all time.
1.0,"A top notch sadistic and twisted Aussie horror film that keeps you thinking ""What next?"".  Great acting, great storyline and well produced. Well worth seeing this one! Especially for fans of horror flix.  I will never think the same way about Kasey Chambers' song ""Am I Not pretty enough""."
1.0,"destined to be a cult classic, awesome"
