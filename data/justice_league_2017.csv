1.0,Don't listen to the haters. Looking forward the next one with Darkseid.
1.0,"Better than Wonder Woman. It has a lot of issues that need to be fixed (I'm looking at you, Flash), but overall it was a very enjoyable film. Superman is Superman, here!Far superior to Star Wars TLJ!"
1.0,"Justice League started off shaky, but eventually it had a solid stand point. It was really entertaining and enjoyable."
0.0,"The cast is kinda okay, but the movie is just so ugly and generic, I can't help but hate it."
0.0,The first Justice League movie feels like a cheap cartoon.
1.0,"Amazing movie loved it , wasn't expecting how good after Batman vs Superman . Wonder Woman just a really solid character.Flash needs a bit of work ,I'm looking forward to Aquaman movie very strong character."
1.0,had a privilege of watching some of the best superheros of all time.The movie could have been much more coherent.
1.0,Fun film but with problems. Hollywood here is a tip: NEVER LET JOSS WHEDON DO ANYTHING ON YOUR FILMS! Everything he touches turns to crap! I hope that like BvS an extended version comes out on Blu-Ray WITH WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN Zack Snyder's original cut.
1.0,Better than Star Wars the Last Jedi

1.0,An OUTSTANDING movie!!!
1.0,A true course correction from BvS. Filled with fast paced fun and action. Superman steals the show.
0.0,What happened to Zack Snyder's vision?? This movie is like a trashy Marvel movie. And Marvel movies are trash....
1.0,there are alot of terrible movies that got better score than JL u can argue that the movie was bad but for me it was lots of fun and I enjoyed it more than most of the year's movies
0.0,A porn parody does a better job at adapting the characters.
1.0,I loved the Zack Snyder tone D.C. Had leading into justice league. The reshoots and cutting the run time down I feel hurt the overall product as well as the lighter feel that was brought to screen. I still really enjoyed the movie though aside from the Super cgi stache

1.0,Awesome film. A movie for real comic book fans.
0.0,"Lamentable dialogues that a toddler could have done better writing. I cannot believe how stupid this movie is, especially after the promising Wonder Woman this year. Did they hire a Marvel writer for the her?"
1.0,I LOVED this Movie!!!!! (Even Better than Wonder Woman!!) It DID NOT Deserve 40%... #JusticeLeague #GoodMovie
1.0,"This movie was very good. The characters were very solid and likable. The plot was good. It is almost as if the Critics were trying to kill this movie before it opened. However, the Audience score shows how well they liked it. Once again the critics got it wrong."

0.0,"weak villain, forced jokes, put together in a rush! I enjoyed the cartoon series a lot more!"

1.0,best movie team up ever
0.0,"Total mess of a movie. It had some great moments, but that's all. MOMENTS. Two directors made this film, but it felt more like a dozen directors turned in 2 cuts each and let the high school intern edit it all together. It's still better than Man of Steel, though!"
1.0,"Al fin una pel¨ªcula de super-heroes seria y madura, sin chistes cada minuto como Marvel"
1.0,"Por mucho que unten a la cr¨ªtica para votarla negativamente solo hay que ir a verla para darse cuenta que es una pura farsa. Gran pel¨ªcula, gran historia, grandes actores hacen que la pel¨ªcula sea grande!"

1.0,"Just like batman V Superman Critics are wrong, and lets hope Affleck continues to play Batman"

1.0,"loved it, great family fun"
1.0,"We'll Done, the added humor was a big plus"
0.0,"Esse filme da Liga deveria ser 2 filmes de duas horas e meia de dura??o, como os executivos da warner n?o manjam nada disso colocaram tudo em um filme de 2 horas, ou seja, os 40% da Rotten Tomatoes faz mais sentido ainda."

1.0,amazing movie the tomatometer is so wrong this deserves a 80%

1.0,The best hero movie ever
0.0,"I absolutely have no idea what even happened in that movie, I just know that it was incredibly underwhelming, a total let-down, boring, and the only thing that made it even slightly bearable was the occasional comic relief from none other than Ezra Miller."
0.0,Boorish and uninspired. When will DC learn?
0.0,"Hated it. I thought DC was going in a great direction with Wonder Woman but this movie really ruined all progress. Seriously. Horrible movie. The only redeemable parts were the humorous ones, but those were very few."

1.0,"I sat and watched this with the wife and I'm sorry but there's no pleasing some just take it as it is, we enjoyed it, it was fun and funny we watched it for what it was and we enjoyed ever minute so stop moaning if you don't like it go back to marvel but as an avid dc fan it was worth my money."

1.0,Seen it was awesome. Can't wait for more to come out.
1.0,One of the best DCEU movie's so far! Still not liking the fact that WB are cutting out scene's from the movie that people saw in the trailers. Hope it ends soon.

1.0,a great looking movie with some great dialogue
0.0,"Incredibly boring, poorly constructed, and a complete waste of time. Illogical decision making and poor chemistry between the characters."

1.0,Una De Las Mejore Pel¨ªculas No Decepciona
1.0,"I'm a huge movie fanatic, and I'm honestly not sure why some people have been giving this movie a bad rep. It's honestly my new favorite movie. The casting was amazing, I love the role of humor brought in throughout the movie. It gives you a feeling of justice for sure."
1.0,Great superhero movie ever made
1.0,Do not listen to the critics on this one. This movie is absolute fun!
1.0,"This movie is obviously well liked my audiences. Critics in my opinion(especially this one) seem to alway get it wrong. Maybe it's cause they are bought by Marvel/Disney. Just saying. This is not a Marvel movie. DC is a completely different universe. See it that way, and respect it that way."
1.0,"I loved it. There was fun moments, touching and hearting moments. It is a fun ride. Justice League had some issues. For example, it goes pretty fast and it had to much marvel sex jokes. Next justice league they should not cut out parts and no more Joss Whedon. I gave this a B+.You should watch this."

1.0,So much fun! Great action sequences and larger than life characters.
1.0,"Loved it, great fun, well told comic book story. Should have been longer to tell a little more on the back story but overall a great fun movie. Danny Elfmans score from 1989 was a lovely touch."
0.0,"Truly awful on every single level. If you ever saw Green Lantern, well Justice League is even worse than that mess. Devoid of any originality, likeable characters, or script. Honestly, you would think they made it this bad on purpose."
1.0,I always worry that a super hyped movie can't live up to the anticipation. Wow.. this one really did. I recommend hitting it at the IMAX
1.0,I really enoyed this movie. too much fun. but I hated they deleted scenes.
1.0,"Is not the movie that we wanted, is not perfect, actually kind of messy and a weak villain, but you cannot deny this is a fun movie."

1.0,"critics, get over yourselves, it's a fun movie!!"
1.0,critics wrong as usual
1.0,"Great DC movie, visuals: fantastic! Story: I can accept. I was excited for Superman, although, it makes Superman's death in Batman vs. Superman pointless."

1.0,"it was a good movie, really"
1.0,Absolutely loved it!!
1.0,Finallly DC are remembering what a comic movie is! I loved this film just enough of each hero and an epic battle at the end. It reminded me of an old justice league cartoon on a much grander scale!
1.0,Not as good as Wonder Woman but close. Mamoa's Aquaman is beyond perfect. And I was pleasantly surprised by Miller and Fisher's Flash and Cyborg. They became instant favourites.

1.0,I had a blast watching this film. I laughed a lot as well. I almost died laughing at one point.

1.0,"I don't care what the rest of you think. 5 stars...Great story,soundtrack,action...EVERYTHING WAS FUN. It is very deep and you have to love the comics to love this. BRAVO! I can't wait for the sequel."
1.0,"O Filme ¨¦ ¨®timo, rid¨ªculos s?o esses ""cr¨ªticos"" que fizeram que n?o gostam do Zack e fizeram essa avalia??o chegar em 41%, metade da avalia??o do p¨²blico em geral, que ¨¦ 82%. Uma discrep?ncia dessa s¨® demonstra uma grande m¨¢-f¨¦."
1.0,Great movie! Truly Super
1.0,good movie.I love wonder woman.
1.0,"If you dont read the comics or watch the animation, its hard for people to understand with not character back stories."
1.0,Don't believe the movie bashing critics. This was a great action packed movie that you would expect with these DC super heroes. I'm shocked at all the bashing the critics continue to do after the movie was released. Just take all that and dump it.....go see this movie if you are a DC fan.
1.0,perfect movie. superman return very god.
1.0,"claro, un monton de haters de DC opinando..."

1.0,GREAT movie. Much better than any Thor movie or Avengers.

1.0,I cannot for the life of me understand why this movie has a score of 43% on here.. Solid B+
1.0,"Very fun and entertaining. Each character was well introduced without making you feel interrupted. Each had their own moments to shine individually and as a team. If you dont compare this movie with other super heroe movies, you will enjoy it as it is. A solid fun and entertaining film."
0.0,Made no sense half of the time. Acting was mediocre. Effects looked low budget. No idea what this was
1.0,Go watch it!!! it's a fun movie!!!!!!!
0.0,If DC ever wants to make another good movie they have to get away from trying to make Marvel CU rip offs. They're just not very good at it. I hated almost everything about this flick. Momoa was the only bright spot in a dull lifeless killjoy of a film.

1.0,"a bit dark, but good action scenes and a great performance by the cast."
1.0,"The movie was lot's of fun. The interactions between the main heroes were the highlight of the whole film. Most of these superhero movies are formulaic, regarding story. This is about the same, but the dynamic works so well."
1.0,best super hero show I have seen
