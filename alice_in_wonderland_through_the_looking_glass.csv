1.0,incorrect but good. way better than the 1st one
0.0,I don't know HOW in the world anyone actually liked this movie. It just drags on and on and on and on and on. The characters are corny and Johnny Depp on top of being WASTED in this movie just wasn't funny. I'd recommend a Sy-Fy Original Film like Sharknado over this disaster of a Disney sequel.
1.0,I absolutely adored this movie!!!! so very awesome!!!!
1.0,This is one of the best movies of 2016. The visuals are some of the best in the history of cinema and the story is perfectly substantial. Tim Burton influence obvious and inspired.

1.0,"Amazing acting, colors, music and everything is brilliant!"
1.0,Johnny Depp's best performance
1.0,"Visually very impressive, and Sacha Baron Cohen put in his best performance to date. I can understand that the movie is not everyone's cup of tea, but I think anyone who like surreal and absurd scenes will enjoy it."
1.0,Enchanting and absolutely wonderful. Loved every minute of this beautiful movie!
0.0,"2 out of 10:Even if it is as visually stunning as the first movie, the storyline in Through the Looking Glass is filled with plot holes and the film bares a dull pace."
1.0,I definitely love Alice through the looking glass very colorful an interesting movie I just loved it a whole lot
1.0,I don't get why people are hating on this movieIt was on acting and special effects the same as the first movieIt kinda looks like all the movie credits are stupid zombies
1.0,I thought this movie was excellent. Alice was back and was the same spunky girl that I enjoyed watching in the first movie. I thought the rest of the cast also gave an excellent performance.
0.0,The only thing this shares with the book is the title. Another terrible Alice movie. Hopefully they quit butchering this classic heroine.
0.0,Sequel to the okay Disney live action Lewis Carrol classic although this one really fails to captivate or match the first one. The original cast returns with Johnny Depp but it's hard to recommend just based on that
0.0,Barely watchable. It's like a CGI nightmare. Nothing was good about this.
1.0,"Very rare that I prefer the sequel to the prequel! Very enjoyable, absolutely loved it!"

0.0,Worst film ever bored to hell
0.0,"I removed my eyeballs from my head as soon as I got back from this movie and cleaned them in a sink. I could have left them in andn only cleaned the fronts, but I didn't want to take any chances. I guess my point is that the visual thrills outweighed the underwhelming story."
1.0,idk why people hated it I thought it was awesome
1.0,My son and I enjoyed it.

1.0,10 times better than the first one
1.0,That was a great movie.
0.0,Suitable for younger kids may be. Funny though when seconds made into minute and minutes into hours were made into robots With a hint of the Transformers.
1.0,This movie gave me a message the message was that time is valuable and you should be proud to have because with out time you have nothing. Time is a give so be proud to have it.
1.0,"The jokes may be the same and the plot may seem too simple, but the movie has an emotion that little are able to achieve. Alice trough the looking glass may not be fit for your advanced critics, but it certainly is more than many of your Hightops... :)"

1.0,Amazing film. Could not miss a bit. Well done to Tim Burton and James Robin for making an iconic film and Johnny Depp for bringing such a unique character to life. Well done to Mia Wasikowksa for her amazing work playing Alice in such a tricky situlation.

1.0,"Stunning visuals, an intriguing plot, and even more of our badass heroine Alice Kingsleigh, Alice manages to please, delight, bewitch, entrance, and make you emotional all at the same time. By far the most enchanting movie of the year, possibly the last five."

1.0,"Awesome movie, if you haven't seen it yet, go check it out!"

0.0,"Act 1: grade B. Good story set up. Tough female ship captain a surprise. Act 2: grade D. It all starts to fall apart as story grows complicated, confusing. Act 3: grade F. A mess. Depp, Cohen Bonham Carter did little for their paychecks. Overall: grade D+."
0.0,"A highly disappointing mess of a movie. All this movies achieves is proving how hard Tim Burton and Jonny Depp have fallen off in recent years. The visuals are disgusting, the story is weak and uninteresting, the acting is awkward, and the whole movie made me cringe for the entire runtime."

1.0,Definitely worth seeing in 3-D!
1.0,Better then the original <3 A fun story and beautiful visuals.
1.0,The film is visually stunning and well paced. The characters are your typical oddball characters from the first movie. You get to see Alice sailing the ship briefly in the beginning of the film. Its a fun adventure and definitely something I'd buy to watch over and over again with my family.
0.0,"It was god awful. Boring all the way through. Lacklaster, boredom, and almost fell asleep is what you will expect."
1.0,I thought it was fantastic in every respect. Seeing this movie makes me want to see the first one .

0.0,"the story is pointless, the writing is terrible, and it's 99 pct CGI (including a horrible cgi rendering of a close-up of the hatter). There is nothing good about this movie at all. Not even Sacha Baron Cohen could save it."

0.0,"I have never seen a movie made as blatantly made to sell video games as this one. From the scene where Alice falls through the sky aiming for rings in the way down, the jumping on to clocks and other objects, right up to the boss battle. At least TMNT had it's video game before the movie came out."

0.0,"Twice I have fallen asleep in a movie theater. The 1st time was watching E.T. after having 30 White Russians. Maybe that's really ""passing out?"". The 2nd time was watching this awful mess. Don't waste your time, unless you really need a nap."

1.0,"No matter what the critics say, this was spectacular movie that showed family and being yourself matters"
1.0,This movie was just entertaining! Perfect
0.0,Compared to the novel this film does not go alongside the guidelines of the original story. I find it humourous that the whole story revolves around a tart. If it had not been for the tart there would have been no story to tell (which in my opinion would have been for the best)
1.0,I liked it! It kept my interest.
1.0,Imax 3d was amazing with this movie. Edith was so beautiful. (Mia)

1.0,"Loved it, was so good x"
1.0,really dun and good movie also free thanks flikster
0.0,Sadly the film suffers. Poor story and poor acting. The movie is a CGI barf-fest and with lacking characters the movie is a boring dump of a movie. I felt like this would have been a direct to video decision rather than a theatrical one.
1.0,"Fantastic Movie! My daughter said ""It was better than the first Alice and Wonderland."" Definitely recommend seeing this. :)"
1.0,Loved this fantastical masterpiece! The characters were awesome; Alan Rickman's voice was lovely to hear and the creativity never stopped. The preoccupation with time and changing it was thought provoking. The imagery beyond words.....loved the Hatter!!
1.0,Loved it ! And it was visually stunning!
1.0,Loved it! Better than the Tim Burton original. Not as good as the animated classic but good.
1.0,We really liked this movie. Anyone who rated it any lower obviously didn't see it in 3D!!! It was awesome.

0.0,"It's a shame with all the money, talent and experience Disney has that they can't just follow the REAL story line of the book. Tom Burton sucks. He makes crap."
1.0,"I really loved this movie. was nice to see the trailer didn't give away the whole plot/movie. it's a great family film, stressing the importance of family and never giving up, learning from mistakes. no clue why people are reviewing it horribly."

1.0,My children and I thoroughly enjoyed it! Love Tim Burton movies!
1.0,Loved it! Cute message. Lots of action. Adorable characters
0.0,Horrific. Lack of any adherence to classical story. But beyond that lack of mythological aspects that any fairy tale requires. Like watching a bad acid trip. The children of America deserve better. Lewis Carol would turn in his grave.
1.0,Amazing movie. Highly recommend
1.0,SO GOOD! DO NOT LET ROTTEN TOMATOES FULL YOU OR JUDGE IT ON THE ORIGINAL. IT WAS FANTASTIC
1.0,"one of the best films I seen this year, I will always have a special place in my heart for the first film but for this movie it amazed me how much they improved on it."
0.0,"Setting up as a sequel that nobody really asked for that lacks of compelling and imaginative story, the only thing good about Alice Through the Looking Glass are the impressive visuals and costumes"

1.0,Thought is was full of wonder-ful!!
1.0,Great film. I don't usually like Tim burton films but I loved this one.
1.0,"I really loved the movie because I have used to watch Alice in Wonderland when I so little, and have such an imagination that I was Alice, and so I am so inspired by Alice since I was little thing, and still that way till today. Well Done."
1.0,an improvement over first premise as well as visually stunning may not be the best story but delivers as a light sequel.
0.0,They thought they wouldn't make a movie no one asked for six years later. they were wrong.
0.0,"Truly awful travesty which has nothing to do with the book, and no intrinsic value as a story or film in its own right. Avoid at all cost."
1.0,lve it was very good:-):-)
1.0,"Tim Burton has done it again, cinematic beauty. Stunning visuals and a wonderful and exciting story. If you loved the first film you will love this one. All cast members coming back to reprise their roles. Also, one of (if not the final film) for Alan Rickman. Must see it again."
1.0,I don?t know why so many people dislike this movie. I thought it even better than the first one. The movie has a good moral and is really fun to watch. I liked that the characters got background stories to explain their behavior.
0.0,Better than first one but still crap
1.0,Alice through the Looking Glass is the most creative and imaginative film. Subtle irony and philosophical suggestions underlay this exciting fun filled movie. I have never been a fan of the Disneys Alice but this movie is the cake!
1.0,"In not sure what movie all the complainers saw, but this movie was Fantastic! I'm seeing it again."
1.0,"Fun, interesting time travel through what looked like brain neurons, a lot of subtle imagery in the film, good for the young mind, and fun for the mature mind. Levels of meaning within the story, what Lewis Carroll captured with words this film captures with images."
1.0,"Just saw this yesterday. Mesmerizing. Some movies shoot out of the blocks. This one will likely gain momentum as people tell their friends how great it was. Critics are out to lunch about the entertainment level of this expertly shot movie. It's a beautiful, cinematic masterpiece!"
0.0,"Horrible. Horrible dialogue, horrible acting. The story jumps all over the place."
1.0,A Disney sleeper. Starts out slowly then picks up steam. Worth seeing...
0.0,Dull beyond belief. The screenwriter should be shot for filling the plot with SJW drivel. How wonderful the classic story but sad to be reduced to silly nonsense.
1.0,Loved it. Great imagery merged with fantastic themes including empowering women. Looking forward to seeing it again
0.0,"I agree with critics' comments, fab visuals and costumes, rubbish acting and script."
1.0,"This was a visual magic-land that captured the importance of dreams, reality and mindfulness."
1.0,I completely enjoyed it.
1.0,I like it because is daft.Ben
1.0,Way better than the first one!! That's all I have to say!
0.0,Special effects do not make up for a well done movie with characters that are fleshed out and developed. what a complete bore.
1.0,I loved this movie! I saw it in 3D and it was amazing. Johnny Depp is outstanding as the mad hatter! I laughed and cried! I had so many emotions during this film
1.0,"Johnny Depp is great, as usual."
1.0,"it doesn't worth 5 star, but I'll still rate it 5 because of these critics assholes"
